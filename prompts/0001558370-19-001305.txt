     Overview
     We are a leader in the field of gene therapy, seeking to develop one-time administered treatments with potentially curative results for patients suffering from genetic and other devastating diseases. We are working to advance a focused pipeline of innovative gene therapies that have been developed both internally and through partnerships, such as our collaboration with Bristol Myers-Squibb focused on cardiovascular diseases. In January 2019, we commenced the dosing phase of a pivotal study of AMT-061, our lead product candidate for patients with hemophilia B. Also, in January 2019, we received notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) of the clearance of our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for AMT-130, our product candidate for patients with Huntington’s disease, thereby enabling us to initiate our Phase I/II clinical study. In November 2018 we announced the expansion of our research pipeline to include additional novel gene therapy candidates for treating additional indications, including hemophilia A, Fabry disease and spinocerebellar ataxia Type 3 (“SCA3”).
 We believe our gene therapy technology platform and manufacturing capabilities provide us distinct competitive advantages, including the potential to reduce development risk, cost and time to market. We produce our adeno-associated virus based, or AAV-based, gene therapies in our own facilities with a proprietary, commercial-scale, current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), compliant, manufacturing process. We believe our Lexington, Massachusetts-based facility is one of the world's leading, most versatile, gene therapy manufacturing facilities.
 Key events
     Commencing a pivotal study of hemophilia B lead candidate (“AMT-061”)
 On February 4, 2019, we announced the dosing of the first patient in our Phase III HOPE-B hemophilia B pivotal trial. The trial is a multinational, multi-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AMT-061. After the six-month lead-in period, patients will receive a single intravenous administration of AMT-061. The primary endpoint of the study will be based on the Factor IX (“FIX”) activity level achieved following the administration of AMT-061, and the secondary endpoints will measure annualized FIX replacement therapy usage, annualized bleed rates and safety. Patients enrolled in the HOPE-B trial will be tested for the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AAV5 but will not be excluded from the trial based on their titers.

In February 2019, we presented updated data from our Phase IIb dose-confirmation study of AMT-061, which demonstrated that all three patients experienced increasing and sustained FIX levels after a one-time administration of AMT-061. Twelve weeks after administration, mean FIX activity for the three patients was 38% of normal, exceeding threshold FIX levels generally considered sufficient to significantly reduce the risk of bleeding events. The first patient achieved FIX activity of 48% of normal at 16 weeks after administration. FIX activity in the second patient was 25% of normal at 14 weeks following administration and in the third patient was 51% of normal at 12 weeks after administration. Based on the data obtained through December 13, 2018, no patient experienced a material loss of FIX activity, reported any bleeding events or required any infusions of FIX replacement therapy. AMT-061 has been well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported and no patients requiring any immunosuppression therapy.
 Preparing for the clinical development of Huntington product candidate (“AMT-130”)
 In January 2019, our IND application for AMT-130 was cleared by the FDA, thereby enabling us to initiate our planned Phase I/II clinical study. The Phase I/II study is expected to be a randomized, double-arm, blinded, imitation surgery-controlled trial conducted at three surgical sites and at least two non-surgical sites in the U.S. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of AMT-130 at two doses.

 Expanding our preclinical pipeline and proprietary technology platform
 In November 2018, we announced the expansion of our research pipeline with three new AAV-based product candidates. Our lead preclinical candidate, AMT-180, is a novel hemophilia A gene therapy candidate that we believe has the potential to treat all hemophilia A patients, including those with past and current inhibitors. Our next most advanced preclinical candidates, AMT-190 and AMT-150, are differentiated gene therapy candidates for the treatment of Fabry disease and SCA3, respectively.
 Also, in November 2018, we presented our miQURE™ gene silencing technology platform. miQURE is uniQure’s novel technology platform designed to degrade disease-causing genes, without off-target toxicity, and induce silencing of the entire target organ through secondary exosome-mediated delivery. Preclinical studies of miQURE-based gene therapies have demonstrated several important advantages, including enhanced tissue-specificity, improved nuclear and cytoplasmic gene lowering and no off-target effects associated with impact on the normal cellular miRNA or mRNA mechanisms. Gene therapy candidates designed with miQURE incorporate proprietary, therapeutic miRNA constructs that can be delivered using AAVs to potentially provide long-lasting activity. miQURE technology has been incorporated in our gene therapy product candidate for Huntington’s disease, and is expected to be applied to our gene therapy candidate for SCA3.
 Financing
 In May 2018, we raised $138.4 million through a follow-on public offering of 5.2 million ordinary shares at $28.50 per ordinary share.
 In December 2018, we increased our existing $20 million credit facility to $35 million, extended the maturity by three years to May 31, 2023 and extended the interest-only period by at least two years to November 2020.     Our Mission and Strategy
 Our mission is to deliver curative gene therapies that transform the lives of patients. 
 Our strategy to achieve this mission is to:
 Advance the development of AMT-061, a potentially best-in-class treatment of hemophilia B. AMT-061 combines the advantages of AAV5 with an enhanced Padua-FIX transgene, and may provide optimized clinical and tolerability benefits to all, or nearly all patients with hemophilia B. We have achieved alignment with the FDA and European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) on what we believe is an expedited clinical development plan. We initiated the lead in phase of our pivotal study program in 2018, and we dosed the first patient in January 2019.
 Maintain our leadership position in commercial-scale AAV manufacturing. We have established cGMP, commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities for AAV-based gene therapies in our state-of-the-art Lexington, Massachusetts facility. We successfully produced batches of multiple gene therapy products using the same fundamental manufacturing process, methods and controls. We believe the modularity of our platform provides us with distinct advantages, including the potential for reduced development risk and faster times to market.
 Build a pipeline of gene therapy programs focused on rare and orphan diseases targeting liver-directed and central-nervous system (“CNS”) diseases. Beyond our lead clinical program for hemophilia B and our Huntington’s program, we have a pipeline of additional AAV-based gene therapy programs in various stages of preclinical development. We are leveraging our leading technology platform, which includes novel vectors, promoters and manufacturing capabilities, to develop gene therapies primarily focused on rare, monogenic liver-directed, and CNS diseases as well as cardiovascular diseases. 
 Leverage the favorable immunogenicity profile of AAV5-based gene therapies to develop multiple products. We have demonstrated AAV5-based gene therapies to be generally safe and well-tolerated in four clinical trials conducted in 25 patients. No patient treated with AAV5-based gene therapies experienced a confirmed immune response to the capsid or complications associated with T-cell activation, such as a material loss of efficacy. Clinical trials also demonstrated that AAV5 has the lowest prevalence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies (“Nab”) compared to other AAV vectors, which may enable all, or nearly all patients to be eligible for treatment with AAV5-based gene therapies.

 Invest in next-generation technologies to expand the applicability of gene therapy to patients. We are developing proprietary technologies that have the potential to enhance safety and efficacy of our product candidates and may broaden the applicability of our gene therapies to a wider range of diseases and patients. These technologies include (i) tailored vectors and promoters; (ii) optimized delivery and administration techniques and (iii) novel transgenes. These technologies are developed both in-house by our experienced research team in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, as well as via collaborations with third parties.
 Continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio. We have established what we believe is a leading intellectual property portfolio covering various aspects of our technology and programs, including (i) elements of our gene therapy constructs, such as AAV vectors, promoters and transgenes, including the novel Padua-FIX gene we utilize in AMT-061 for hemophilia B; (ii) innovative delivery technologies, such as re-administration of AAV gene therapy; and (iii) proprietary manufacturing processes covering key components of our upstream and downstream capabilities. We expect to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio by aggressively seeking patent protection for promising aspects of our technology platform and product candidates.

      Liver-directed diseases
     Hemophilia B
     Hemophilia B Disease and Market Background
 Hemophilia B is a serious and rare inherited disease in males characterized by insufficient blood clotting. The condition can lead to repeated and sometimes life‑threatening episodes of external and internal bleeding following accidental trauma or medical interventions. Severe hemophilia is characterized by recurrent episodes of spontaneous joint bleeds that cause long‑term damage to the joints resulting in disabling arthropathy. Bleeds may be fatal if they occur in the brain. The deficient blood clotting results from the lack of functional human Factor IX (“hFIX”). Treatment of hemophilia B today consists of prophylactic or on‑demand protein replacement therapy, in which one to three times weekly intravenous administrations of plasma‑derived or recombinant hFIX are required to prevent bleeding and once daily infusions in case bleeding occurs. Hemophilia B occurs in approximately 1 out of 30,000 live male births. Our Development of AMT‑061 for Hemophilia B
 We are currently developing AMT-061, a gene therapy for patients with hemophilia B that is designed to restore Factor IX (“FIX”) activity, an essential protein for blood clotting. AMT-061 includes an AAV5 vector incorporating our patent-protected FIX-Padua variant (“FIX-Padua”). AMT-061 is identical in structure to our first-generation hemophilia B product candidate, AMT-060, apart from two nucleotide substitutions in the coding sequence for FIX. The FIX-Padua 

 
  6


 
variant expresses a protein with a single amino acid substitution that has been reported in multiple preclinical and nonclinical studies to provide an approximate eight- to ninefold increase in FIX activity compared to the wild-type protein, which was incorporated in AMT-060. All other critical quality attributes of AMT-061 are expected to be comparable to those of AMT-060, as AMT-061 utilizes the same AAV5 capsid and proprietary insect cell-based manufacturing platform.
 AMT-061 is intended to be delivered by IV-infusion, without immunosuppressant therapy, through the peripheral vein in a single treatment session for approximately 30 minutes.
 Our goal for AMT-061 is to develop a gene therapy with the following profile:
    
· | long-term safety, including a favorable immunogenicity profile;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | predictable, sustained and potentially curative increases in FIX activity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | significant reductions in both bleeding rates and the need for FIX replacement therapy; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | broad patient eligibility, including the potential to treat all or nearly all patients with hemophilia B
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      AAV5-based gene therapies have been demonstrated to be generally safe and well-tolerated in a multitude of clinical trials, including four uniQure trials conducted in 25 patients in hemophilia B and other indications. In contrast to data reported using other AAV capsids delivered systemically via IV infusion, no patient treated in clinical trials with our AAV5 gene therapies has experienced any confirmed, cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response to the capsid or material loss of FIX activity. An independent clinical trial has demonstrated that AAV5 has the lowest prevalence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies compared to other AAV vectors. Data from our clinical, preclinical and nonclinical studies suggest that all, or nearly all patients may be eligible for treatment with AMT-061.
     The FDA has agreed that AMT-061 will fall under the existing Breakthrough Therapy Designation and IND for AMT-060, and the EMA has also agreed that AMT-061 will fall under the current priority medicines (“PRIME”) designation.
 In June 2018, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the Phase III HOPE-B pivotal study of AMT-061. The Phase III HOPE-B pivotal trial is a multinational, multi-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AMT-061. Approximately 50 adult hemophilia B patients classified as severe or moderately severe will be enrolled in a six-month observational period during which time they will continue to use their current standard of care to establish a baseline control. After the six-month lead-in period, patients will receive a single IV-administration of AMT-061. The primary endpoint of the study will be based on the FIX activity level achieved following the administration of AMT-061, and the secondary endpoints will measure annualized FIX replacement therapy usage, annualized bleed rates and safety. Patients enrolled in the HOPE-B trial will be tested for the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AAV5 but will not be excluded from the trial based on their titers. In January 2019 we dosed the first patient in our HOPE-B pivotal trial.
 In September 2018, we completed the dosing of a Phase IIb dose-confirmation study of AMT-061. The Phase IIb study is an open-label, single-dose, single-arm, multi-center trial being conducted in the United States. The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMT-061 and confirm the dose based on FIX activity at six weeks after administration.  Three patients with severe hemophilia were enrolled in this study and received a single intravenous infusion of 2x1013 genome copies per kilogram (“gc/kg”). Patients are evaluated for the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AAV5 but not excluded from the trial on this basis. We will continue to follow patients for a total 52 weeks to assess FIX activity, bleeding rates and usage of FIX replacement therapy, and will monitor the three patients for five years to evaluate the safety of AMT-061.

 In December 2018, the study’s Data Monitoring Committee evaluated initial data from the Phase IIb study and confirmed the dose of 2x1013 gc/kg for the Phase III pivotal trial. In February 2019, we presented updated data from the Phase IIb dose-confirmation study, which demonstrated that all three patients experienced increasing and sustained FIX levels after a one-time administration of AMT-061. Twelve weeks after administration, mean FIX activity for the three patients was 38% of normal, exceeding threshold FIX levels generally considered sufficient to significantly reduce the risk of bleeding events. The first patient achieved FIX activity of 48% of normal at 16 weeks after administration. FIX activity in the second patient was 25% of normal at 14 weeks following administration and in the third patient was 51% of normal at 12 weeks after administration. Based on the data obtained through December 13, 2018, no patient experienced a material loss of FIX activity, reported any bleeding events or required any infusions of FIX replacement therapy. AMT-061 has been well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported and no patients requiring any immunosuppression therapy.
 Intellectual Property for AMT-061
 In 2017, we acquired intellectual property from Professor Paolo Simioni (“Dr. Simioni”), a hemophilia expert at the University of Padua, Italy.  The intellectual property includes U.S. Patent Number 9,245,405, which covers compositions of FIX-Padua nucleic acids and polypeptides (proteins), as well as their therapeutic uses.
 In May 2018, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) granted us a second patent, U.S. Patent Number 9,982,248, which covers methods of treating coagulopathies (bleeding disorders), including hemophilia B, using AAV-based gene therapy with nucleic acid encoding the hyperactive FIX Padua variant. The FIX Padua variant is a Factor IX protein carrying a leucine at the R338 position, often called the "FIX-Padua" or "Padua mutant".
 In addition to the U.S. patent, in February 2018, the Canadian Intellectual Property Office granted Patent Number 2,737,094, which covers FIX-Padua nucleic acids for use in gene therapy and FIX-Padua polypeptides for use in FIX replacement therapy. We are also currently pursuing European patents directed toward therapeutic uses of FIX-Padua nucleic acids and polypeptides.
 Phase I/II Clinical Trial of AMT-060
 In the third quarter of 2015, we initiated a Phase I/II clinical trial of AMT‑060, our first-generation hemophilia B product candidate, in patients with severe or moderately‑severe hemophilia B. AMT-060 consists of an AAV5 vector carrying a codon-optimized, wild-type, human Factor IX gene cassette licensed from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The study is a five‑year, open‑label, uncontrolled, single‑dose, dose‑ascending multi‑center trial that includes two cohorts, with the low‑dose cohort using a treatment of 5x1012 gc/kg and the second‑dose cohort using 2x1013 gc/kg. We enrolled five patients into the low dose cohort in the third quarter 2015. Another five patients were enrolled into the high dose cohort between March and May 2016. 
 In December 2018, we presented long-term clinical data from our ongoing Phase I/II study of AMT-060, including up to two and a half years of follow-up. The data demonstrated that AMT-060 continues to be safe and well-tolerated, with no new serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors. All ten patients sustained increases in FIX activity and improvements in their disease state as measured by reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy and decreased bleeding frequency.
 All five patients in the second dose cohort of 2x1013 gc/kg continue to be free of routine prophylaxis at up to two years after treatment.  During the last 12 months of observation, the mean annualized bleeding rate was 0.5 bleeds, representing an 88% reduction compared to the year prior to treatment. During the same period, the usage of FIX replacement therapy declined 93% compared to the year prior to treatment. Mean FIX activity increased from 7.1% in the first year after treatment to 8.3% in the second year and was 8.9% of normal at the last measurement.

 Hemophilia A program (AMT-180)
 Hemophilia A Disease and Market Background

Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII (“FVIII”) deficiency or classic hemophilia, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII, a clotting protein. Although it is passed down from parents to children, about 1/3 of cases are caused by a spontaneous mutation, a change in a gene. More than half of the patients have the severe form of hemophilia A. Patients with severe hemophilia A experience bleeding following an injury and may have frequent spontaneous bleeding episodes, often into their joints and muscles. Hemophilia A occurs in approximately one in 5,000 live births. Approximately 30 percent of patients with severe hemophilia A will develop an inhibitor that neutralizes the infused FVIII activity. Historically, this patient population has been underserved due to past exclusion from gene therapy research in clinical development.  Our Development of AMT-180 for Hemophilia A
 AMT-180 is a novel hemophilia A gene therapy that we believe has the potential to treat all hemophilia A patients including those with past and current inhibitors. AMT-180 is a one-time, intravenously-administered, AAV5-based gene therapy incorporating a proprietary modified Factor IX gene, Super9™, that has been demonstrated in preclinical studies to circumvent inhibitors to FVIII. A proof-of-concept study indicated that administration of Super9 resulted in clinically relevant FVIII mimetic activity in hemophilia A mice and was not associated with hypercoagulability in wild-type mice. Another study in non-human primates indicated that a single dose of AMT-180 resulted in expression levels that translate into FVIII mimetic activity expected to be clinically relevant in hemophilia A patients with or without inhibitors. In addition, Super9 induced clinically relevant thrombin activation in FVIII-depleted human plasma with or without inhibitors. These data indicate that AMT-180 may lead to durable expression in hemophilia A patients and may provide long-term prevention of bleeds. In early 2019, we initiated IND-enabling studies of AMT-180.
 Fabry disease program (AMT-190)
 Fabry Disease and Market Background
 Fabry disease is a progressive, inherited, multisystemic lysosomal storage disease characterized by specific neurological, cutaneous, renal, cardiovascular, cochleo-vestibular and cerebrovascular manifestations. Fabry disease is caused by a defect in a gene that encodes for a protein called α-galactosidase A (“GLA”). The GLA protein is an essential enzyme required to breakdown globotriaosylsphingosine (“Gb3”) and lyso-globotriaosylsphingosine (“lyso-Gb3”). In patients living with Fabry disease, Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 accumulate in various cells throughout the body causing progressive clinical signs and symptoms of the disease. Current treatment options, which consist of bi-weekly intravenous enzyme replacement therapy, typically have no therapeutic benefit in patients with advanced renal or cardiac disease. Studies have also shown that a majority of male patients develop antibodies that inhibit the GLA protein and interfere with therapeutic efficacy.
 Fabry disease has two major disease phenotypes: the type 1 “classic” and type 2 “later-onset” subtypes. Both lead to renal failure, and/or cardiac disease, and early death. Type 1 males have little or no functional a-Gal A enzymatic activity (<1% of normal mean), and marked accumulation of GL-3/Gb3 and related glycolipids in capillaries and small blood vessels which cause the major symptoms in childhood or adolescence.  In contrast, males with the type 2 “later-onset” phenotype (previously called cardiac or renal variants) have residual a-Gal A activity, lack GL-3/Gb3 accumulation in capillaries and small blood vessels, and do not manifest the early manifestations of type 1 males. They experience an essentially normal childhood and adolescence. They typically present with renal and/or cardiac disease in the third to seventh decades of life. Most type 2 later-onset patients have been identified by enzyme screening of patients in cardiac, hemodialysis, renal transplant, and stroke clinics and recently by newborn screening. Fabry disease occurs in all racial and ethnic populations and affects males and females. It is estimated that type 1 classic Fabry disease affects approximately one in 40,000 males. The type 2 later-onset phenotype is more frequent, and in some populations may occur as frequently as about 1 in 1,500 to 4,000 males.

 Our Development of AMT-190 for Fabry Disease
 AMT-190 is a one-time, intravenously-administered, AAV5-based gene therapy designed to circumvent GLA antibodies that can inhibit efficacy in Fabry patients. AMT-190 incorporates a modified version of α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (“NAGA”), a protein that is structurally similar to the GLA protein but is not recognized by GLA-neutralizing antibodies. As such, AMT-190 has the potential to be a more effective, longer-term treatment of Fabry disease. In cultured cells and in a study in wild-type mice, AMT-190 resulted in clinically relevant GLA activity. In a preclinical proof-of-concept study, Fabry mice were injected with a single dose of AMT-190, resulting in modified NAGA expression with subsequent GLA-activity in plasma. At two- and four-weeks post-dosing, this GLA activity already translated to up to fifty percent reduction in lyso-Gb3 levels. We believe that these studies demonstrate proof-of-concept of AMT-190 as a gene therapy candidate for Fabry disease. We believe that a one-time administration of AMT-190 could potentially lead to long-term expression of GLA in the liver, kidneys and heart, with no loss of expression due to inhibitors. We plan to conduct additional pre-clinical tests during 2019. Central Nervous System diseases
 Huntington’s Disease 
 Huntington’s Disease and Market Background

Huntington’s disease is a severe genetic neurodegenerative disorder causing loss of muscle coordination, behavioral abnormalities and cognitive decline, often resulting in complete physical and mental deterioration over a 12 to 15-year period. The median survival time after onset is 15 to 18 years (range: 5 to >25 years). Huntington’s disease is caused by an inherited defect in a single gene that codes for a protein called Huntingtin (“HTT”). The prevalence of Huntington’s disease is three to seven per 100,000 in the general population, similar in men and women, and it is therefore considered a rare disease. Despite the ability to identify Huntington’s disease mutation carriers decades before onset, there is currently no available therapy that can delay onset or slow progression of the disease. Although some symptomatic treatments are available, they only are transiently effective despite significant side effects. Our Development of AMT-130 for Huntington’s Disease

AMT-130 is our gene therapy candidate targeting Huntington’s disease that utilizes an AAV vector carrying an engineered micro-RNA (“miRNA”) designed to silence the HTT. AMT-130 is our lead product candidate developed using our miQURE technology, a proprietary, one-time administered gene silencing platform. AMT-130 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation from the EMA. AMT-130 is intended to be administered directly into the brain via a stereotactic, magnetic resonance imaging guided catheter. 
 Our goal for AMT-130 is to develop a gene therapy with the following profile:

· | One-time administration in the striatum of disease modifying therapy;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong HTT knockdown in both deep structures and cortex;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | Use of proprietary miQURE platform.
--+------------------------------------

      In April 2017, we presented preclinical data on AMT-130 in transgenic mini pigs. The data demonstrated widespread, dose-dependent distribution of the vector throughout the mini pig brain that corresponded strongly with the mutant HTT expression. Researchers also observed a dose-dependent reduction in mutant HTT protein levels, as well as similar trends in cerebral spinal fluid. Both the surgical procedure and AMT-130 treatment were well tolerated with no adverse events. 
 In October 2017, we presented preclinical data on AMT-130 in a mouse model with a highly aggressive form of Huntington’s disease which demonstrated significant improvements in both motor-coordination and survival, as well as a dose-dependent, sustained reduction in HTT. 
 In April 2018, we presented an overview of preclinical data establishing proof-of-concept for AMT-130 at the 2018 American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting in Los Angeles, California. Data from multiple studies in Huntington's disease animal models across three different species showed that a single intraparenchymal administration of AMT-130 into the striatum, resulted in a dose-dependent and sustained reduction of mutant huntingtin protein 

 
  10


 
(“mHTT”) in both the deep structures of the brain and the cortex. Specifically, we presented data from the ongoing preclinical study in transgenic minipigs, one of the largest Huntington's disease animal models available, demonstrating significant reductions in human mHTT by a median of 68% in the striatum and a median of 47% in the frontal cortex at 6 months after administration of AMT-130.
 In January 2019 our IND application for AMT-130 was cleared by the FDA, thereby enabling us to initiate our planned Phase I/II clinical study. The Phase I/II study is expected to be a randomized, double-arm, blinded, imitation surgery-controlled trial conducted at three surgical sites in the U.S., with at least two non-surgical sites. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of AMT-130 at two doses.
 Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 program
 Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 and Market Background
 SCA3 is a central nervous system disorder. SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease, is caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene that results in an abnormal form of the protein ataxin-3. Patients with SCA3 experience brain degeneration that results in movement disorders, rigidity, muscular atrophy and paralysis. There is currently no treatment available that slows the progressive course of this lethal disease.
 Prevalence of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 is estimated to be one to two per 100,000 with significant geographical and ethnic variations: the highest prevalence has been found in the Azores (Flores Island (1/239)), intermediate prevalence rates in Portugal, Germany, the Netherlands, China and Japan, and lower prevalence in North America, Australia and India. SCA3 is the most common form of ADCA1 in most genetically characterized populations.
 Our preclinical SCA3 program

AMT-150 is a one-time, intrathecally-administered, AAV gene therapy incorporating our proprietary miQURE™ silencing technology that is designed to halt ataxia in early manifest SCA3 patients. In an in-vitro study with human Induced Pluripotent Stem (“IPS”) derived neurons, AMT-150 has been shown to lower the human ataxin-3 protein by 65%, without any off-target effects. We also performed a proof-of-concept in-life study in SCA3 mice demonstrating that AMT-150 was able to lower toxic ataxin-3 protein by 65% in the brain stem after a single administration. Further studies in non-human primates demonstrate the ability to distribute and express a reporter gene at a clinically relevant level in the most degenerated brain regions in SCA3. These preclinical studies demonstrate that a single administration of AMT-150 results in sustained expression and efficient processing with on-target engagement. They also demonstrate that AMT-150 appears to be safe due to the lack of off-target activity. In 2019 we intend to initiate large animal studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
     Bristol‑Myers Squibb Collaboration
 In 2015, we entered into an agreement with BMS that provides exclusive access to our gene therapy technology platform for multiple targets primarily focused on cardiovascular diseases (“Collaboration and License Agreement”). We are supporting BMS in discovery, non‑clinical, analytical and process development efforts and are responsible for manufacturing of clinical and commercial supplies using our vector technologies and industrial, proprietary insect-cell based manufacturing platform. BMS reimburses us for all our research and development costs in support of the collaboration, and will lead development, regulatory and commercial activities across all programs. 
 Collaboration on cardiovascular and other diseases focused targets
 In total, the companies may collaborate on ten targets, including cardiovascular targets and potentially targets in other areas. BMS initially designated four research targets, including S100A1 for congestive heart failure (“AMT-126”). BMS and we in October 2018 completed a heart function proof-of-concept study of AMT-126 in a pre-clinical animal model of heart failure. The study demonstrated deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) delivery and expression of S100A1 in the myocardium, thereby validating our vector delivery platform in the animal model. The data did not show a benefit on heart function at six months, and consequently, the Joint Steering Committee for the collaboration has chosen to discontinue work on S100A1. We expect that BMS will replace the S100A1 collaboration target with another cardiovascular target and that we and BMS will continue working on the other collaboration targets under the collaboration.

 Equity arrangements
 After entering into the collaboration in 2015 BMS acquired 2.4 million or 9.9% of our outstanding shares following the issuance for aggregate consideration of $75.5 million. As of December 31, 2018, BMS held 6.4% of our outstanding ordinary shares. We have also granted BMS two warrants. BMS may at its option acquire, at a premium to the market, an additional number of shares such that BMS owns 14.9% and 19.9%, respectively, of our outstanding ordinary shares immediately after such purchase. The exercise of each warrant is conditioned upon the designation of a specified number of additional collaboration targets and payment of related fees by BMS, as well as a minimum number of collaboration programs under development.
 We also entered into an Investor Agreement with BMS regarding the rights and restrictions relating to the ordinary shares to be acquired by BMS. We have granted BMS certain registration rights that allow BMS to require us to register our securities beneficially held by BMS under the Exchange Act. BMS may make up to two such demands (or three, in the event that either warrant is exercised) for us to register the shares, provided that we may deny such demand if (i) the market value of the shares to be registered is less than $10 million (provided however, if BMS holds less than $10 million worth of our shares, we must comply with their demand for registration), (ii) we certify to BMS that we plan to effect a registration within 120 days of their demand or we are engaged in a transaction that would be required to be disclosed in a registration statement and that is not reasonably practicable to be disclosed at that time, or (iii) we have already effected one registration statement within the twelve months preceding BMS’s demand for registration. In addition, independent of their demand registration rights, upon the occurrence of certain events, we must also provide BMS the opportunity to include their shares in any registration statement that we effect.
 We have also granted BMS certain information rights under the Investor Agreement, although these requirements may be satisfied by our public filings required by U.S. securities laws.
 Pursuant to the Investor Agreement, without our consent, BMS may not (i) acquire a number of shares such that the number of shares that BMS beneficially holds is greater than the percentage acquired, or which may be acquired, after giving effect to each of the tranches under the Share Subscription Agreement and the two warrants; (ii) propose, offer or participate in any effort to acquire us or one of our subsidiaries; (iii) propose, offer or participate in a tender offer for our shares or any exchange of shares that would effect a change of control of our company; (iv) seek to control or influence our governance or policies; (v) join or participate in any group regarding the voting of our ordinary shares; or (vi) take certain other similar actions. BMS may still, among other things, make a non‑public, confidential proposal to enter into a business combination or similar transaction with our company. These standstill restrictions will terminate upon the occurrence of certain events including, but not limited to, the acquisition of a certain material number of shares by a third party, if we enter into a merger agreement or similar transaction with a third party, or upon the passage of a defined period of time subsequent to the acquisition of shares pursuant to the Share Subscription Agreement or the warrants.
 BMS is also subject to a lock‑up pursuant to the Investor Agreement. Without our prior consent, BMS may not sell or dispose of its shares until the later of (i) the fourth anniversary of the purchase of the first tranche of shares pursuant to the Share Subscription Agreement in June 2019 (or fifth anniversary in June 2020 if the Collaboration Agreement is extended), or (ii), in respect of each ordinary share acquired pursuant to the Share Subscription Agreement and the warrants, the first anniversary of issuance of each such ordinary shares. However, this lock‑up may terminate sooner in the event the Collaboration Agreement is terminated.

The Investor Agreement also requires BMS to vote all of our ordinary shares it beneficially holds in favor of all items on the agenda for the relevant general meeting of shareholders of our company as proposed on behalf of our company, unless, in the context of a change of control or similar transaction, BMS has itself made an offer to our company or our supervisory or management boards in connection with the transaction that is the subject of the vote, in which case it is free to vote its shares at its discretion. This voting provision will terminate upon the later of the date on which BMS no longer beneficially owns at least 4.9% of our outstanding ordinary shares, the closing of a transaction that provides BMS exclusive and absolute discretion to vote our shares it beneficially holds, or the termination of the Collaboration Agreement for breach by us.

 New Technology Development
 We are seeking to develop next‑generation technologies with the goal of further improving the potential of AAV-based gene therapies to treat patients suffering from debilitating diseases. We are focused on innovative technologies across each of the key components of an AAV-based gene therapy, including: (i) the capsid, or the outer viral protein shell that encloses the target DNA; (ii) the promoter, or the DNA sequence that drives the expression of the transgene; and (iii) the transgene, or therapeutic gene. 
 We have a significant effort dedicated to designing and screening novel AAV capsids with the potential for (i) higher biological potency; (ii) increased specificity and penetration of specific tissue types; and (iii) enhanced safety. Members of our team have significant expertise in vector engineering and have created promising genetically engineered capsids using a “rational design” approach. 
 We are also utilizing a “directed evolution” approach to identifying next-generation AAV capsids, which involves a capsid selection process in which libraries of mutant variants are screened for optimal properties. In January 2014, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with 4D Molecular Therapeutics for the discovery and optimization of next‑generation AAV capsids targeting the liver and the brain. We have identified several promising next-generation AAV capsids and are currently in the process of evaluating them for use in future gene therapy programs.
 We have also worked extensively on designing synthetic promoters with the potential of enabling higher levels of protein expression in specific tissue types. Promoters are sequences of DNA that sit beside each gene and function to activate transcription of the gene into messenger RNA. Synthetic promoters, which do not exist in nature, are optimally tailored to drive gene expression at a desired level and specificity. In January 2015, we entered into an agreement with Synpromics, a United Kingdom‑based biotechnology company, to jointly fund research relating to the development of optimized promoters. We have identified several promising liver-directed promoters and are currently in the process of evaluating them for use in future gene therapy programs targeting liver-directed diseases. One such promoter from the Synpromics collaboration is being utilized in our AMT-180 program for the treatment of hemophilia A.
 Commercial-Scale Manufacturing Capabilities
 The ability to reliably produce at a high quality and at commercial-scale is a critical success factor in AAV gene therapy. We produce our gene therapies using our proprietary, insect cell-based, baculovirus AAV production system. 
 This system has a number of advantages that enable high quality commercial-scale manufacturing, including:

· | High Yield. A single manufacturing run at 500-liter scale can yield many thousands of doses of an AAV gene therapy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | High Purity. The baculovirus system eliminates the risk of introducing mammalian cell derived impurities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Scalability. This process is reproducible at volumes ranging from 0.02 liters to 500 liters. We believe achieving higher scale production with our insect-cell, baculovirus system is possible.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Intellectual Property
     Introduction
     We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection in the United States, Europe and other countries for novel components of gene therapies, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these gene therapies, the use of these components in gene therapies, our technology platform, and other inventions and related technology. We also rely on trade secrets, security measures and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
    
 
  13


 

 We expect that our probability of success will be significantly enhanced by our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know‑how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know‑how, continuing technological innovation and in‑licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of AAV‑based gene therapies.
     In some cases, we are dependent on the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to develop and commercialize our products. We must obtain licenses from such third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. For example, we license from third-parties essential parts of the therapeutic gene cassettes as well as the principal AAV vectors we use and key elements of our manufacturing process. We anticipate that we will require additional licenses in the future.
     Because most patent applications throughout the world are confidential for 18 months after the earliest claimed priority date, and since the publication of discoveries in the scientific and patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent or file applications for the inventions covered by our pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in post‑grant proceedings in the patent offices of the United States or foreign jurisdictions, such as oppositions, reexaminations or interferences, in which the patentability or priority of our inventions are challenged. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
     Our intellectual property portfolio consists of owned and in‑licensed patents, copyrights, licenses, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights.
     Patent Portfolio
     Our gene therapy programs are protected by patents and patent applications directed to various aspects of our technology. For example, our gene therapy programs are protected by patents and patent applications with composition‑of‑matter or method of use claims that cover the therapeutic gene, the promoter, the viral vector capsid or other specific parts of these technologies. We also seek protection of core aspects of our manufacturing process, particularly regarding our baculovirus expression system for AAV vectors in insect cells. In addition, we have filed manufacturing patent applications with claims directed to alternative compositions‑of‑matter and manufacturing processes to seek better protection from competitors.
     We file the initial patent applications for our commercially important technologies in both Europe and the United States. For the same technologies, we typically file international patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) within a year. We also may seek, usually on a case‑by‑case basis, local patent protection in Canada, Australia, Japan, China, India, Israel, South Africa, New Zealand, South Korea and Eurasia, as well as South American jurisdictions such as Brazil and Mexico.
     As of December 31, 2018, our intellectual property portfolio included the following rights:
    
· | 23 patent families that we own;
--+--------------------------------


· | 7 patent families that we exclusively in‑license; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | 1 patent family that we non‑exclusively in‑license.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 We own a a patent family directed to AAV5 administration technology in patients combined with an intralipid infusion procedure. This family includes a PCT-application. The standard 20-year term of patents in this family, if issued, will expire in 2038.
    
We own a patent family directed to AAV gene therapy vectors comprising liver-specific promoters. This family includes a provisional application in the United States, which was filed in 2018. The standard 20-year term of patents in this family, if filed and issued, will expire in 2039.
    
We own a patent family directed to gene therapy involving microRNA, including the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and the monitoring of the effects of such treatment. This family includes a provisional application in the United States, which was filed in 2018. The standard 20-year term of patents in these families, if filed and issued, will expire in 2039.
     Our Patent Portfolio Related to Development Programs
     Hemophilia B
     We own a patent family, including patents and patent applications, directed to the use of the Padua mutation in hFIX for gene therapy in AMT-061. A PCT application was filed on September 15, 2009, and patents have been issued in the United States, Europe, and Canada. Further applications are pending in the United States, Europe, and Hong Kong. The issued patents include claims directed to Factor IX protein with a leucine at the R338 position of the protein sequence, nucleic acid sequences coding for this protein, and therapeutic applications, including gene therapy. The standard 20-year patent term of patents in this family will expire in 2029.
     On June 13, 2018, we were granted European Patent 2337849 directed to a Factor IX polypeptide protein.  European patent law provides for a nine-month period during which third parties may file oppositions to issued patents.  On December 21, 2018, we received notice that an opposition was filed by Strawman Limited, which we believe was filed on behalf of an anonymous third party. The opposition seeks revocation of our patent on the grounds that it is not new, does not involve an inventive step and several other reasons. The opposition period expires on March 13, 2019, and additional oppositions could be filed until that deadline. Following the deadline, a schedule of proceedings will be set by the European Patent Office to address the opposition. We expect that we will vigorously defend our patent in any opposition proceedings.
     Huntington’s disease
     We own a patent family directed to gene therapy treatment of Huntington’s disease within AMT-130. This family includes an issued patent in the United States and pending patent applications in the US, Europe and other jurisdictions. The standard 20-year term of patents in this family will expire in 2035.
     Hemophilia A (AMT-180) and SCA3 (AMT-150) 
    
We own a patent family directed to AAV-based gene therapies for treatment of hemophilia A and SCA3. This family includes a provisional application in the United States, which was filed in 2018. The standard 20-year term of patents in these families, if filed and issued, will expire in 2039.     Licenses
     We have obtained exclusive or non‑exclusive rights from third parties under a range of patents and other technology that we use in our product and development programs, as described below. Our agreements with these third parties generally grant us a license to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import products covered by the licensed patent rights in exchange for our payment of some combination of an upfront amount, annual fees, royalties, a percentage of amounts we receive from our licensees and payments upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Some of the agreements specify the extent of the efforts we must use to develop and commercialize licensed products. The agreements generally expire upon expiration of the last‑to‑expire valid claim of the licensed patents. Each licensor may terminate the applicable agreement if we materially breach our obligations and fail to cure the breach within a specified cure period.

 Technology Used for Multiple Programs
     We are exploiting technology from the third-party sources described below in more than one of our programs.
     National Institutes of Health—AAV production
     In 2007, we entered into a non‑exclusive license agreement with the NIH, which we amended in 2009 and 2013. The patents under this license cover technology to produce AAV vectors in insect cells. We may only grant sublicenses under this agreement with the NIH’s consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld. The standard 20‑year term for the underlying patents will expire in 2022.
     Payment obligations to the NIH under this license agreement include a low single‑digit percentage royalty on the net sales of licensed products by us or on our behalf; development and regulatory milestone payments; and an annual maintenance fee creditable against royalties. We do not have to pay royalties or milestone fees under this agreement if we have to pay royalties or milestone fees under our 2011 agreement with the NIH, described below, for the same product. Under the license agreement, we have agreed to meet benchmarks in our development efforts, including as to development events, clinical trials and marketing approval, within specified timeframes.
     The NIH may terminate this agreement in specified circumstances relating to our insolvency or bankruptcy. We may terminate this agreement for any reason, in any territory, subject to a specified notice period. 
     National Institutes of Health—AAV5
     In 2011, we entered into another license agreement with the NIH, superseding an earlier agreement. This agreement was amended in 2016. Under this agreement, the NIH granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to patents relating to AAV5 for use in therapeutic products to be delivered to the brain or liver for treatment of human diseases originating in the brain or liver but excluding arthritis‑related diseases, and a non‑exclusive, worldwide license to patents relating to AAV5 for all other diseases. We refer to the products licensed under this agreement as AAV5 products. We may grant sublicenses under this agreement only with the NIH’s consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld. The standard 20‑year term for the underlying patents will expire in 2019.
     Payment obligations to the NIH under this license agreement include royalties equal to a low single‑digit percentage of net sales of AAV5 products; development and regulatory milestone payments; and an annual maintenance fee creditable against royalties. If an AAV5 product is also covered by our 2007 agreement with the NIH, our obligation to pay royalties on net sales and our obligation to pay milestone fees only apply under this 2011 agreement and not the 2007 agreement. We have agreed to meet benchmarks in our development efforts, including as to development events, clinical trials and marketing approval, within specified timeframes.
     The NIH may terminate this agreement in specified circumstances relating to our insolvency or bankruptcy. We may terminate this agreement for any reason, in any country or territory, subject to a specified notice period. 
     Protein Sciences
     In 2016, we revised our existing license contract with Protein Sciences Corporation for the use of its expresSF+ insect cell line and associated technology for human therapeutic and prophylactic uses (except influenza) to provide us with a royalty free, perpetual right and license to the licensed technology in the field of AAV‑based gene therapy.

 Technology Used for Specific Development Programs
     Hemophilia B
     Padua
    
On April 17, 2017, we entered into an Assignment and License Agreement with Dr. Simioni (the “Padua Assignment”). Pursuant to the Padua Assignment, we acquired from Dr. Simioni all right, title and interest in a patent family covering the variant of the Factor IX gene, carrying an R338L mutation (FIX-Padua; “Padua IP”). Under the Padua Assignment, we have also licensed certain know-how included in the Padua IP. We will provide Dr. Simioni with an initial license fee and reimbursement of past expenses, as well as payments that may come due upon the achievement of certain milestone events related to the development of the Padua IP and may also include royalties on a percentage of certain revenues. We have granted a license back of the Padua IP to Dr. Simioni for therapeutic or diagnostic use of a modified Factor IX protein (other than in connection with gene therapy) and any application for non-commercial research purposes. We have agreed to indemnify Dr. Simioni for claims arising from our research, development, manufacture or commercialization of any product making use of the Padua IP, subject to certain conditions.  The Padua Assignment will remain in effect, unless otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of the Padua Assignment, until the later of (i) the expiration date of the last of the patents within the Padua IP and (ii) the expiration of the payments obligations under the Padua Assignment.     St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital
     In 2008, we entered into a license agreement with St. Jude, which we amended in 2012. Under the license agreement, St. Jude has granted us an exclusive license, with a right to sublicense, to patent rights relating to expression of hFIX in gene therapy vectors, to make, import, distribute, use and commercialize products containing hFIX covered by a valid patent claim in the field of gene therapy for treatment or prophylaxis of hemophilia B. In addition, we have a first right of negotiation regarding any patent applications that are filed by St. Jude for any improvements to the patent rights licensed to us. The U.S. patent rights will expire in 2028 and the European patents will expire in 2025.
     We have agreed to pay St. Jude a royalty equal to a low single‑digit percentage of net sales, if any, by us or our sublicensees of products covered by the licensed patent rights, and a portion of certain amounts we receive from sublicensees ranging from a mid‑single digit to a mid‑teen double‑digit percentage of such amounts. We have also agreed to pay St. Jude one‑time milestone fees totaling $6.5 million upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones, and an annual maintenance fee creditable against royalties and milestones in the same year. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently develop and commercialize products licensed under this agreement.
     The agreement will remain in effect until no further payment is due relating to any licensed product under this agreement or either we or St. Jude exercise our rights to terminate it. St. Jude may terminate the agreement in specified circumstances relating to our insolvency. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time subject to a specified notice period.
     Rockefeller University
     In 2018 we entered into a Tangible Material License Agreement with Rockfeller University, NY. The non-exclusively licensed materials are used to develop and commercialize a diagnostic test and allow us to screen patients who will be treated with uniQure’s therapeutic products. The license with Rockefeller has granted us sublicensing rights under specific conditions in order to conduct all activities necessary to develop and commercialize on its own behalf within the field of use.
     We paid a one-time execution fee and will pay an annual fee until commercialization of the diagnostic test occurs. If we commercialize the diagnostic test, we will pay Rockefeller University a tiered annual fee based on the number of diagnostic tests sold.

 Huntington’s disease and SCA3
     Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (“CSHL”)
     In 2015, we entered into a license agreement with CSHL in which CSHL granted to us an exclusive, sublicensable license to develop and commercialize certain of CSHL’s patented RNAi‑related technology for use in connection to the treatment or prevention of Huntington’s disease. The standard 20-year patent term for the licensed patents expires in 2031.
     In 2018, we entered into an amendment of the license agreement with CSHL that expanded the license to include the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of CNS diseases, including but not limited to Huntington’s disease. In addition, under the amended license agreement CSHL granted to us an exclusive license for a three-year term to develop and commercialize therapeutic products for the additional disease classifications of liver diseases, neuromuscular diseases and cardiovascular diseases. If we meet certain diligence milestones during the initial three-year development term, we may license the additional disease classifications on similar terms and conditions as the CNS diseases.
     Under the license agreement, annual fees, development milestone payments and future single-digit royalties on net sales of a licensed product are payable to CSHL.
     Hemophilia A
     DRK Blutspendedienst (“DRK”)


In 2018, we entered into a research and option agreement with DRK-Blutspendedienst Baden-Wuertttemberg-Hessen GmbH. Under the agreement, we received an option to exclusively license from DRK patents and other intellectual property in the area of FIX variants potentially useful in treating Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B, and the parties agreed to undertake a research plan to allow us to evaluate whether we desire to exercise the option. The option expires in April 2019. The associated Assignment and License Agreement (ALA) will, if executed, give us a worldwide exclusive, sublicensable license to develop and commercialize under the DRK patents FIX-variants for the treatment of Hemophilia by gene therapy. The standard 20-year patent terms for the patents and patent applications that are the subject of this research and option agreement will expire in 2029 and 2034 respectively. Under the proposed terms of the ALA, we would pay an option fee, milestone payments when certain development milestones are achieved, and a single-digit royalty on net sales of products commercialized under the DRK patents. If we do not meet certain development milestones in either field of hemophilia A or hemophilia B, we could lose our license to the DRK intellectual property in that field. We are currently negotiating with DRK the terms of a proposal to apportion the rights to intellectual property that was created during the term of the research and option agreement, which may affect the final terms of the ALA.
     Fabry’s disease
     Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science (“TMIMS”)
    
In 2018, we entered into a license agreement with TMIMS. Under the agreement, TMIMS granted us an exclusive, sublicensable license to develop and commercialize certain TMIM’s patented modified alpha-N-acetylgalactoaminidases for the treatment of Fabry by gene therapy. The standard 20-year patent term for the patent families which are the subject of this license agreement expire in 2026 and 2028.
     Under the terms of the license agreement we will pay development milestones and a single-digit royalty on net sales of a commercialized product.
     Trade Secrets
     In addition to patents and licenses, we rely on trade secrets and know‑how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of the process by which we manufacture our gene therapies are based on unpatented trade secrets and know‑how. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes and obtain and maintain ownership of certain technologies, in part, through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial collaborator. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know‑how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.

 Trademarks
     uniQure is a registered trademark in various jurisdictions including the United States and the European Union. In 2018, we applied for trademark protection for the marks miQURE and Super9, related to our gene silencing and hemophilia technologies, respectively. We may seek trademark protection for other product candidates and technologies as and when appropriate.     Competition
     The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the gene therapy field, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
     We are aware of numerous companies focused on developing gene therapies in various indications, including AGTC, Abeona Therapeutics, Adverum Biotechnologies, Allergan, Ally Therapeutics, Audentes Therapeutics, AVROBIO, Axovant Sciences, Bayer, BioMarin, bluebird bio, Expression Therapeutics, Freeline Therapeutics, Generation Bio, Genethon, GlaxoSmithKline, Homology Medicines, Lysogene, Megenics, Milo Therapeutics, Nightstar, Novartis, Pfizer, REGENXBIO, Renova Therapeutics, Rocket, Pharmaceuticals, Sangamo BioSciences, Sanofi, Selecta Biosciences, Sarepta, Shire, Solid Biosciences, Spark Therapeutics, Takara, Ultragenyx, Vivet Therapeutics, and Voyager, as well as several companies addressing other methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. We may also face competition with respect to the treatment of some of the diseases that we are seeking to target with our gene therapies from protein, nucleic acid, antisense, RNAi, gene editing and other therapeutic modalities under development or commercialized at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as Alnylam, Amgen, Bayer, Biogen, BioMarin, CSL Behring, Dicerna, Ionis, LogicBio, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Translate Bio, Roche, Sangamo, Sanofi, Shire, Sobi, Spark, Wave Biosciences, and numerous other pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms.
     We also compete with existing standards of care, therapies and symptomatic treatments, as well as any new therapies that may become available in the future for the indications we are targeting.
     Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early‑stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
     The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. We also believe that, due to the small size of the patient populations in the orphan indications we target, being first to market will be a significant competitive advantage. We believe that our advantages in vector and manufacturing technology will allow us to reach market in a number of indications ahead of our competitors, and to capture the markets in these indications.
     Government Regulation and Reimbursement
     Government authorities in the United States, European Union and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the approval, research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture (including any manufacturing changes), packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, reimbursement, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, biological products and medical devices. We believe that all of our product candidates will be regulated as biological products, or biologics, and in particular, as gene therapies, and will be subject to such requirements and regulations under U.S. and foreign laws. For other countries outside of the United States and the European Union, marketing approval and pricing and reimbursement requirements vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, refusal to approve pending applications, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

 Regulation in the United States
     In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. Obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with applicable statutes and regulatory requirements entails the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources, including payment of user fees for applications to the FDA. All of our current product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States must typically undertake the following:
    
· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice (“cGLP”) regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND application which allows human clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days; the sponsor of an IND or its legal representative must be based in the United States
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) and Institutional Biosafety Committee (“IBC”) before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s or EMA’s good clinical practices (“GCP”) to establish the safety, potency, purity and efficacy of the proposed biological product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as selected clinical trial sites and investigators to determine GCP compliance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval of the BLA by the FDA, in consultation with an FDA advisory committee, if deemed appropriate by the FDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with any post‑approval commitments, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”), and post‑approval studies required by the FDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Human Clinical Studies in the United States under an IND
     Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which includes requirements for informed consent, study conduct, and IRB review and approval. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. A clinical trial may not proceed in the United States unless and until an IND becomes effective, which is 30 days after its receipt by the FDA unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on hold. INDs include preclinical study reports, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and proposed clinical study protocols among other things. 
     The protocol and informed consent documents must also be approved by an IRB. In the case of gene therapy studies, an IBC at the local level must also review and maintain oversight over the particular study, in addition to the IRB.  The FDA, an IRB, and IBC, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that research requirements are not being met. Information about certain clinical trials, including results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for listing on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. Subsequent clinical protocols and amendments must also be submitted to an active IND but are not subject to the 30-day review period imposed on an original IND. There is a risk that once a new protocol or amendment is submitted to an active IND there may be an extended period before the FDA may comment or provide feedback. This may result in a need to modify an ongoing clinical trial to incorporate this feedback or even a clinical hold of the trial.  There is also risk that FDA may not provide comments or feedback but may ultimately disagree with the design of the study once a BLA is submitted.

     Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
    
· | Phase I: The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase II: The biological product is administered to a limited patient population to further identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase III: The biological product is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk‑benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labelling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Additional kinds of data may also help support a BLA or NDA, such as patient experience data and real world evidence.  Real world evidence may also be used to assist in clinical trial design or support an NDA for already approved products.  For genetically targeted populations and variant protein targeted products intended to address an unmet medical need in one or more patient subgroups with a serious or life threatening rare disease or condition, the FDA may allow a sponsor to rely upon data and information previously developed by the sponsor or for which the sponsor has a right of reference, that was submitted previously to support an approved application for a product that incorporates or utilizes the same or similar genetically targeted technology or a product that is the same or utilizes the same variant protein targeted drug as the product that is the subject of the application.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or BLA supplement for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration, must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Orphan products are also exempt from the PREA requirements.
 The manufacture of investigational drugs and biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and biologics and active ingredients and therapeutic substances imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA. Further, the export of investigational products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, manufacturers must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 FDA Guidance Governing Gene Therapy Products
     The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies that outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and which relate to, among other things, the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing, and control information that should be included in an IND application; the design and analysis of shedding studies for virus or bacteria based gene therapies; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies via long-term follow-up.

 Compliance with cGMP Requirements
     Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market, among other consequences. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
     FDA Programs to Expedite Product Development
     The FDA has several programs to expedite product development, including fast track designation and breakthrough therapy designation. These are outlined in specific FDA guidance. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a biologic candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the product candidate. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine that a product candidate is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. This may be demonstrated by clinical or nonclinical data. If granted, the benefits include greater interactions with the FDA and rolling review of sections of the BLA. In some cases, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval or priority review.
     Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Products designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for rolling review, intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1 trials, and a commitment from the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative, cross disciplinary review.
     Biologics studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means the FDA may approve the product based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. A biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug or biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug or biologic candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
     Submission of a BLA
     The results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting a license to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of a BLA is subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.5 million in fiscal year 2019; products with orphan designation are exempt from the BLA filing fee. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual program user fees for each, currently exceeding $309,000 in fiscal year 2019. Orphan products may also be exempt from program fees provided that certain criteria are met. These fees are typically increased annually. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs.
    
 
  23


 

 Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the filing acceptance date (typically 60 days after date of filing), and most applications for priority review products are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing acceptance date (typically 60 days after date of filing). Priority review designation may be assigned to product candidates that are intended to treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of the serious condition. 
     The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be refiled with the additional information. The refiled application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for review. Once the submission is accepted, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA will assign a date for its final decision for the product (the PDUFA action date) but can request an extension to complete review of a product application.
     The FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biological product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Many drug applications receive complete response letters from the FDA during their first cycle of FDA review.
     If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product; require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including boxed warnings; require that post‑approval studies, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a biologic’s efficacy and safety after approval; or require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post‑market studies or surveillance programs. The FDA may also not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing.
     In addition to the above conditions of approval, the FDA also may require submission of a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the product candidate outweigh the risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. An assessment of the REMS must also be conducted at set intervals. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks.  In guidance, FDA stated that during the review of a BLA for a gene therapy, it will assess whether a REMS is necessary.  Several gene therapy products that have been approved by FDA have required substantial REMS, which included requirements for dispensing hospital and clinic certification, training, adverse event reporting, documentation, and audits and monitoring conducted by the sponsor, among other conditions. REMS, such as these, can be expensive and burdensome to implement, and burdensome for hospitals, clinics, and health care providers to comply with.
     Following approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and the FDA review and approval. The product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product. The results of such tests, along with samples, are submitted to FDA for approval before the lot may be released for distribution. Other post‑approval requirements include reporting of cGMP deviations that could affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, reporting of adverse effects, reporting new information regarding safety and efficacy, maintaining adequate record‑keeping, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
     Biosimilars and Exclusivity
     The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”) which amended the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars under Section 351(k) of the PHSA. Under the BCPIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is biosimilar to or interchangeable with a previously approved biological product or reference product. In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that it is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in safety, purity or potency. A finding of interchangeability requires that a product is determined to be biosimilar to the reference product, and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product 

 
  24


 
and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following approval of the reference product, and it may not be approved until 12 years thereafter. These exclusivity provisions only apply to biosimilar companies and not companies that rely on their own data and file a full BLA. Moreover, this exclusivity is not without limitation.  certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the twelve-year exclusivity period.  Further, the twelve-year exclusivity market period in the U.S. for biologics has been controversial and may be shortened in the future.
     Orphan Drug Exclusivity
     Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may designate a biological product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biological product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval, it will be granted seven years of marketing exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, unless clinical superiority is demonstrated in a head‑to‑head trial. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to AMT-130 for the treatment of Huntington’s disease; meaning that they would receive orphan drug exclusivity if they are the first products approved for their respective indications.     Pediatric Exclusivity
     Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, pediatric exclusivity provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity in the US, including orphan exclusivity and exclusivity against biosimilars. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if the FDA issues a written request to the sponsor for the pediatric study, the sponsor submits a final study report after receipt of the written request, and meets the terms and timelines in the FDA’s written request.     Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designation
     The 21st Century Cures Act became law in December 2016 and created a new program under Section 3033 in which the FDA has authority to designate a product as a regenerative medicine advanced therapy (“RMAT”). A drug is eligible for a RMAT designation if: 1) it is a regenerative medicine therapy which is a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, except those products already regulated under Section 361 of the Public Health Service (“PHS”) Act, 2) the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and 3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. A RMAT must be made with the submission of an IND or as an amendment to an existing IND. FDA will determine if a product is eligible for RMAT designation within 60 days of submission. Advantages of the RMAT designation include all the benefits of the fast track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with the FDA. These early interactions may be used to discuss potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints to support accelerated approval.  In 2017 FDA stated in draft guidance that human gene therapies, including genetically modified cells, that lead to a sustained effect on cells or tissues, may meet the definition of a regenerative therapy.

 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
     We may seek to develop companion diagnostics for use in identifying patients that we believe will respond to our gene therapies. FDA officials have issued draft guidance to address issues critical to developing in vitro companion diagnostics with therapeutics, such as establishing clinical validity, study design, the appropriate patient population and when the FDA will require that the companion diagnostic and the drug be approved simultaneously. The guidance issued in August 2014 states that if safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic device, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic device by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product.
     Anti‑Kickback Provisions and Requirements
     The federal anti‑kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti‑kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
     Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off‑label promotion, have also been alleged by government agencies to violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti‑kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.
     U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
     The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.     Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
     The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payers and independent non-profit healthcare research organizations such as the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (“ICER”) are also increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity, budget-impact and cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third party payers do not consider a product to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies and or the standard of care, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, measures including prior authorization and step throughs could be required and or the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. The U.S. federal and state governments and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government‑paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
    
 
  26


 

 As a result, the marketability of any product which receives regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers choose to provide low coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products that receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
     Regulation in the European Union
     Product development, the regulatory approval process and safety monitoring of medicinal products and their manufacturers in the European Union proceed broadly in the same way as they do in the United States. Therefore, many of the issues discussed above apply similarly in the context of the European Union. In addition, drugs are subject to the extensive price and reimbursement regulations of the various EU member states. The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, as amended (and to be replaced by the Clinical Trial Regulation EU 536/2014 in October 2018), provides a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union via implementation through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application (“CTA”), which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. The sponsor of a clinical trial, or its legal representative, must be based in the European Economic Area. European regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of adverse event reports during a study and a copy of the final study report.
     Marketing approval
     Marketing approvals under the European Union regulatory system may be obtained through a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure results in the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all—currently 28—EU member states. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, the centralized procedure is mandatory for drugs developed by means of specified biotechnological processes, and advanced therapy medicinal products as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007, as amended. Drugs for human use containing a new active substance for which the therapeutic indication is the treatment of specified diseases, including but not limited to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, neurodegenerative disorders, auto‑immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, as well as drugs designated as orphan drugs pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, as amended, also fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Because of our focus on gene therapies, which fall within the category of advanced therapy medicinal products (“ATMPs”) and orphan indications, our products and product candidates are expected to qualify for the centralized procedure.
     In the marketing authorization application (“MAA”) the applicant has to properly and sufficiently demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the drug. Guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs have been issued and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs; the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a MAA; and post‑approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs. Although these guidelines are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain and maintain approval for any of our product candidates. The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the centralized procedure is 210 days after receipt of a valid application subject to clock stops during which the applicant deals with EMA questions.
     Market access can be expedited through the grant of conditional authorization for a medicine that may fulfil unmet needs which may be granted provided that the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive. The benefit-risk balance is likely to be positive if the applicant is able to provide comprehensive data and the benefit to public health of the medicinal product's immediate availability on the market outweighs the risks due to need for further data. Such authorizations are valid for one year and can be renewed annually. The holder will be required to complete specific obligations (ongoing or new studies, and in some cases additional activities) with a view to providing comprehensive data 

 
  27


 
confirming that the benefit-risk balance is positive. Once comprehensive data on the product have been obtained, the marketing authorization may be converted into a standard marketing authorization (not subject to specific obligations). Initially, this is valid for 5 years, but can be renewed for unlimited validity. Applicants for conditional authorizations can benefit from early dialogue with EMA through scientific advice or protocol assistance and discuss their development plan well in advance of the submission of a marketing-authorization application. Other stakeholders (e.g. health technology assessment bodies) can be included.
    
In addition, the priority medicines (PRIME) scheme for medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options based on early clinical data, is intended to support the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. This voluntary scheme is based on enhanced interaction and early dialogue with developers of promising medicines, to optimize development plans and speed up evaluation so these medicines can reach patients earlier. Early dialogue and scientific advice also ensure that patients only participate in trials designed to provide the data necessary for an application, making the best use of limited resources.
     The European Union also provides for a system of regulatory data and market exclusivity. According to Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities approved on the basis of complete independent data package benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application during the eight-year period. During the additional two‑year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten‑year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the innovator is able to gain the period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials. The EMA has also issued guidelines for a comprehensive comparability exercise for biosimilars, and for specific classes of biological products.
     Under Regulation (EC) No 141/20003 as amended (Orphan Drug Regulation, ‘ODR’) a product can benefit from orphan drug status if it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Community (EC) when the application is made. The principle benefit of such status is 10 years’ market exclusivity once they are approved preventing the subsequent approval of similar medicines with similar indications.  
     Additional rules apply to medicinal products for pediatric use under Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. Potential incentives include a six‑month extension of any supplementary protection certificate granted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 469/2009, however not in cases in which the relevant product is designated as an orphan medicinal product pursuant to the ODR. Instead, medicinal products designated as orphan medicinal product may enjoy an extension of the ten‑year market exclusivity period granted under Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, as amended, to twelve years subject to the conditions applicable to orphan drugs.
     Manufacturing and manufacturers’ license
     Pursuant to Commission Directive 2003/94/EC as transposed into the national laws of the member states, the manufacturing of investigational medicinal products and approved drugs is subject to a separate manufacturer’s license and must be conducted in strict compliance with cGMP requirements, which mandate the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. Manufacturers must have at least one qualified person permanently and continuously at their disposal. The qualified person is ultimately responsible for certifying that each batch of finished product released onto the market has been manufactured in accordance with cGMP and the specifications set out in the marketing authorization or investigational medicinal product dossier. cGMP requirements are enforced through mandatory registration of facilities and inspections of those facilities. Failure to comply with these requirements could interrupt supply and result in delays, unanticipated costs and lost revenues, and subject the applicant to potential legal or regulatory action, including but not limited to warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil and criminal penalties.

     In the European Union, the promotion of prescription medicines is subject to intense regulation and control, including a prohibition on direct‑to‑consumer advertising. All medicines advertising must be consistent with the product’s approved summary of products characteristics, factual, accurate, balanced and not misleading. Advertising of medicines pre‑approval or off‑label is prohibited. Some jurisdictions require that all promotional materials for prescription medicines be subjected to either prior internal or regulatory review & approval.     Other Regulatory Requirements
     A holder of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product is legally obliged to fulfill a number of obligations by virtue of its status as a marketing authorization holder (“MAH”). The MAH can delegate the performance of related tasks to third parties, such as distributors or marketing collaborators, provided that this delegation is appropriately documented and the MAH maintains legal responsibility and liability.
     The obligations of an MAH include:
    
· | Manufacturing and Batch Release. MAHs should guarantee that all manufacturing operations comply with relevant laws and regulations, applicable good manufacturing practices, with the product specifications and manufacturing conditions set out in the marketing authorization and that each batch of product is subject to appropriate release formalities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pharmacovigilance. MAHs are obliged to establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system, including a qualified person responsible for oversight, to submit safety reports to the regulators and comply with the good pharmacovigilance practice guidelines adopted by the EMA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Advertising and Promotion. MAHs remain responsible for all advertising and promotion of their products, including promotional activities by other companies or individuals on their behalf and in some cases, must conduct internal or regulatory pre‑approval of promotional materials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Medical Affairs/Scientific Service. MAHs are required to disseminate scientific and medical information on their medicinal products to healthcare professionals, regulators and patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Legal Representation and Distributor Issues. MAHs are responsible for regulatory actions or inactions of their distributors and agents.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Preparation, Filing and Maintenance of the Application and Subsequent Marketing Authorization. MAHs must maintain appropriate records, comply with the marketing authorization’s terms and conditions, fulfill reporting obligations to regulators, submit renewal applications and pay all appropriate fees to the authorities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We may hold any future marketing authorizations granted for our product candidates in our own name, or appoint an affiliate or a collaborator to hold marketing authorizations on our behalf. Any failure by an MAH to comply with these obligations may result in regulatory action against an MAH and ultimately threaten our ability to commercialize our products.
     Reimbursement
     In the European Union, the pricing and reimbursement mechanisms by private and public health insurers vary largely by country and even within countries. In respect of the public systems, reimbursement for standard drugs is determined by guidelines established by the legislature or responsible national authority. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other member states allow companies to determine the prices for their medicines, but monitor and control company profits and may limit or restrict reimbursement. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products and some of EU countries require the completion of studies that compare the cost‑effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Special pricing and reimbursement rules may apply to orphan drugs. Inclusion of orphan drugs in reimbursement systems tend to focus

on the medical usefulness, need, quality and economic benefits to patients and the healthcare system as for any drug. Acceptance of any medicinal product for reimbursement may come with cost, use and often volume restrictions, which again can vary by country. In addition, results‑based rules or agreements on reimbursement may apply. Recently, a process has been formalized that allows sponsors to receive parallel advice from EMA and HTA’s for pivotal clinical studies designed to support marketing approval.
     Orphan Drug Regulation
     We have been granted orphan drug exclusivity for AMT-061 for the treatment of hemophilia B as well as for AMT-130 for the treatment of Huntington’s disease subject to the conditions applicable to orphan drug exclusivity in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, as amended, states that a drug will be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish:
· | that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life‑threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the Community when the application is made, or that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life‑threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, that the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Regulation (EC) No 847/2000 sets out further provisions for implementation of the criteria for designation of a drug as an orphan drug. An application for the designation of a drug as an orphan drug must be submitted at any stage of development of the drug before filing of a marketing authorization application.
     If an EU‑wide community marketing authorization in respect of an orphan drug is granted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, the European Union and the member states will not, for a period of 10 years, accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization or accept an application to extend an existing marketing authorization, for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar drug.
     This period may however be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established, in respect of the drug concerned, that the criteria for orphan drug designation are no longer met, in other words, when it is shown on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a marketing authorization may be granted, for the same therapeutic indication, to a similar drug if:
    
· | the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan drug has given its consent to the second applicant;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan drug is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the drug; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the second applicant can establish in the application that the second drug, although similar to the orphan drug already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Regulation (EC) No 847/2000 lays down definitions of the concepts similar drug and clinical superiority, which concepts have been expanded upon in subsequent Commission guidance. Other incentives available to orphan drugs in the European Union include financial incentives such as a reduction of fees or fee waivers and protocol assistance. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

 Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 212 employees, 98 of whom are based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and 114 in Lexington, Massachusetts. As of December 31, 2018, 40 of our employees had an M.D. or Ph.D. degree, or the foreign equivalent. During 2017, we established a works council in the Netherlands. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining or other labor organizations. We believe that we have good relations with all of our employees and with the works council in the Netherlands.     Corporate Information
     uniQure B.V. (the “Company”) was incorporated on January 9, 2012 as a private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) under the laws of the Netherlands. We are a leader in the field of gene therapy and seek to deliver to patients suffering from rare and other devastating diseases single treatments with potentially curative results. Our business was founded in 1998 and was initially operated through our predecessor company, Amsterdam Molecular Therapeutics (AMT) Holding N.V (“AMT”). In 2012, AMT undertook a corporate reorganization, pursuant to which uniQure B.V. acquired the entire business and assets of AMT and completed a share-for-share exchange with the shareholders of AMT. Effective February 10, 2014, in connection with the initial public offering, the Company converted into a public company with limited liability (naamloze vennootschap) and changed its legal name from uniQure B.V. to uniQure N.V.
     The Company is registered in the trade register of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (Kamer van Koophandel) under number 54385229. The Company’s headquarters are in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and its registered office is located at Paasheuvelweg 25a, Amsterdam 1105 BP, the Netherlands and its telephone number is +31 20 240 6000. 
     From our initial public offering until December 31, 2018 we were an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”). On the last business day of our second quarter in fiscal year 2018 the aggregate worldwide market value of ordinary shares held by our non-affiliate shareholders exceeded $700 million. As a result, as of December 31, 2018, we were considered a large accelerated filer and as a consequence lost our status as an emerging growth company. We are therefore no longer permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are emerging growth companies.
