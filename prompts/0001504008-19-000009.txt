Item 1. Business
Overview
BankUnited, Inc., with total consolidated assets of $32.2 billion at December 31, 2018, is a bank holding company with one wholly-owned subsidiary, BankUnited, collectively, the Company. BankUnited, a national banking association headquartered in Miami Lakes, Florida, provides a full range of banking services to individual and corporate customers through 80 banking centers located in 14 Florida counties and 5 banking centers in the New York metropolitan area. The Bank also provides certain commercial lending and deposit products through national platforms. The Company has built, primarily through organic growth, a premier commercially focused regional bank with a long-term value oriented business model serving primarily small and medium sized businesses. We endeavor to provide, through our experienced lending and relationship banking teams, personalized customer service and offer a full range of traditional banking products and services to both our commercial and consumer customers.
The FSB Acquisition and the Loss Sharing Agreements
On May 21, 2009, BankUnited entered into the "Purchase and Assumption Agreement" with the FDIC, Receiver of BankUnited, FSB, and acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed all of the non-brokered deposits and substantially all other liabilities of the Failed Bank from the FDIC in the FSB Acquisition. 
Concurrently with the FSB Acquisition, the Bank entered into two Loss Sharing Agreements with the FDIC, covering certain legacy assets, including the entire legacy loan portfolio and OREO and certain purchased investment securities. We refer to assets covered by the Loss Sharing Agreements as covered assets or, in certain cases, covered loans. The Loss Sharing Agreements do not apply to assets acquired, purchased or originated subsequent to the FSB Acquisition. At December 31, 2018, the covered assets, consisting of residential loans had an aggregate carrying value of $201 million. The total UPB of the covered assets at December 31, 2018 was $401 million.
Pursuant to the terms of the Loss Sharing Agreements, the covered assets were subject to a stated loss threshold whereby the FDIC was obligated to reimburse the Bank for 80% of losses up to a $4.0 billion stated threshold and 95% of losses in excess of the $4.0 billion stated threshold. The Bank was obligated to reimburse the FDIC for its share of recoveries with respect to losses for which the FDIC paid the Bank a reimbursement under the Loss Sharing Agreements. The FDIC's obligation to reimburse the Company for losses with respect to the covered assets began with the first dollar of loss incurred. We have received reimbursements of $2.7 billion for claims submitted to the FDIC under the Loss Sharing Agreements as of December 31, 2018.
The Loss Sharing agreements consisted of the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement and the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement. The Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement originally provided for FDIC loss sharing and the Bank's reimbursement for recoveries to the FDIC for ten years from May 21, 2009, or through May 21, 2019, for single family residential and home equity loans and related OREO. The Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement was terminated on February 13, 2019. The Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement provided for FDIC loss sharing for five years from May 21, 2009, or through May 21, 2014, and for the Bank's reimbursement for recoveries to the FDIC for eight years from May 21, 2009, or through the quarter ended June 30, 2017, for all other covered assets.
Our Market Areas
Our primary banking markets are Florida and the Tri-State market of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. We believe both represent long-term attractive banking markets. In Florida, our largest concentration is in the Miami metropolitan statistical area; however, we are also focused on developing business in other markets in which we have a presence, such as the Broward, Palm Beach, Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville markets. We operate several national commercial lending platforms, purchase residential loans on a national basis through established correspondent channels and have a national commercial deposit business.
According to estimates from the United States Census Bureau and SNL Financial, from 2015 to 2018, Florida added over 1.2 million new residents, the second most of any U.S. state, and had a total population of 21.5 million and a median household annual income of $55,629 in 2018. The Florida unemployment rate decreased to 3.3% at December 31, 2018. The Moody's home price index for Florida reflected a year over year increase of 5.3% at September 30, 2018. According to CoStar Commercial Repeat-Sale Indices, commercial real estate values in the South region reflected a year over year increase of 9% at December 31, 2018. According to a report published in December, 2018 by the University of Central Florida, personal income 
1

in Florida is expected to average 3.1% growth from 2018 to 2021 while Florida's Real Gross State Product is forecast to expand at an average annual rate of 3.3% from 2018 to 2021.
We had five banking centers in metropolitan New York at December 31, 2018 serving the Tri-State area. Three banking centers were in Manhattan, one in Long Island and one in Brooklyn. According to the FDIC, at June 30, 2018, the Tri-State area had approximately $2.2 trillion in deposits, with the majority of the market concentrated in the New York metropolitan area. The Tri-State area had a total population of 32.5 million and a median household annual income of $73,648 in 2018, while the unemployment rate decreased to 3.7% at December 31, 2018. According to CoStar Commercial Repeat-Sale Indices, commercial real estate values in the Northeast region reflected a year over year increase of 1% at December 31, 2018.
Through two commercial lending subsidiaries of BankUnited, we engage in equipment, franchise and municipal finance on a national basis. The Bank also originates small business loans through programs sponsored by the SBA and to a lesser extent the USDA and provides mortgage warehouse finance on a national basis. We refer to our commercial lending subsidiaries, our small business finance unit, our mortgage warehouse lending operations and our residential loan purchase program as national platforms. We also offer a suite of commercial deposit and cash management products through a national platform.
Products and Services
Lending and Leasing
General—Our primary lending focus is to serve small and middle-market businesses and their executives with a variety of financial products and services, while maintaining a disciplined credit culture.
We offer a full array of lending products that cater to our customers' needs including small business loans, commercial real estate loans, equipment loans and leases, term loans, formula-based loans, municipal and non-profit loans and leases, commercial lines of credit, residential mortgage warehouse lines of credit, letters of credit and consumer loans. We also purchase performing residential loans through established correspondent channels on a national basis. 
We have attracted and invested in experienced lending teams in our Florida, Tri-State and national markets, resulting in significant growth in our non-covered loan portfolio. At December 31, 2018, our loan portfolio included $21.8 billion in non-covered loans, including $17.0 billion in commercial and commercial real estate loans and $4.7 billion in residential and other consumer loans. Continued loan growth in both the Florida and Tri-State markets and across our national lending and leasing platforms is a core component of our current business strategy.
Commercial loans—Our commercial loans, which are generally made to growing small business, middle-market and larger corporate entities, include equipment loans, secured and unsecured lines of credit, formula-based loans, mortgage warehouse lines, letters of credit, SBA product offerings and business acquisition finance credit facilities. 
Commercial real estate loans—We offer term financing for the acquisition or refinancing of properties, primarily rental apartments, mixed-use commercial properties, industrial properties, warehouses, retail shopping centers, free-standing single-tenant buildings, office buildings and hotels. Other products that we provide include real estate secured lines of credit, and, to a limited extent, acquisition, development and construction loan facilities and construction financing. We make commercial real estate loans secured by both owner-occupied and non-owner occupied properties. Construction lending is not a primary area of focus for us; construction and land loans comprised 1.0% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2018.
National Commercial Lending Platforms—Through the Bank's two commercial lending subsidiaries, we provide municipal, equipment and franchise financing on a national basis. Pinnacle, headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, provides financing to state and local governmental entities directly and through vendor programs and alliances. Pinnacle offers a full array of financing structures on a national basis including equipment lease purchase agreements and direct (private placement) bond refundings and loan agreements. Bridge offers large corporate and middle market businesses equipment leases and loans including direct finance lease and operating lease structures through its equipment finance division. Bridge offers franchise equipment, acquisition and expansion financing through its franchise division. Bridge is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. SBF offers an array of SBA, and to a lesser extent, USDA loan products. We typically sell the government guaranteed portion of the loans SBF originates on a servicing retained basis, and retain the unguaranteed portion in portfolio. We also engage in residential mortgage warehouse lending on a national basis.
Residential mortgages—The non-covered residential loan portfolio is primarily comprised of loans purchased on a national basis through select correspondent channels. This national purchase program allows us to diversify our loan portfolio, both by product type and geographically. Residential loans purchased are primarily closed-end, first lien jumbo mortgages for the purchase or re-finance of owner occupied property. We do not originate or purchase negatively amortizing or sub-prime residential loans.

Home equity loans and lines of credit are not a significant component of the loan portfolio.
Consumer loans— Consumer loans are not a material component of our loan portfolio.
Credit Policy and Procedures
BankUnited, Inc. and the Bank have established asset oversight committees to administer the loan portfolio and monitor and manage credit risk. These committees include: (i) the Commercial Loan Committee, (ii) the Credit Risk Management Committee, (iii) the Asset Recovery Committee, (iv) the Criticized Asset Committee and (v) the Residential Credit Risk Management Committee. These committees meet at least quarterly.
The credit approval process provides for prompt and thorough underwriting and approval or decline of loan requests. The approval method used is a hierarchy of individual lending authorities for new credits and renewals. The Credit Risk Management Committee approves authorities for lending and credit personnel, which are ultimately submitted to our Board for ratification. Lending authorities are based on position, capability and experience of the individuals filling these positions. Authorities are periodically reviewed and updated.
BankUnited has established in-house borrower lending limits which are significantly lower than its legal lending limit of approximately $471 million at December 31, 2018. In-house lending limits at December 31, 2018 ranged from $75 million to $150 million. These limits are reviewed periodically by the Credit Risk Management Committee and approved annually by the Board of Directors.
Deposits
We offer traditional deposit products including commercial and consumer checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit with a variety of terms and rates as well as a robust suite of treasury and cash management services. We offer commercial and retail deposit products across our primary geographic footprint and certain commercial deposit and treasury management services on a national platform. We have a limited on-line deposit product offering. Our deposits are insured by the FDIC up to statutory limits. Demand deposit balances are concentrated in commercial and small business accounts. Our service fee schedule and rates are competitive with other financial institutions in our markets.
Investment Securities
The primary objectives of our investment policy are to provide liquidity, provide a suitable balance of high credit quality and diversified assets to the consolidated balance sheet, manage interest rate risk exposure, and generate acceptable returns given the Company's established risk parameters.
The investment policy is reviewed annually by our Board of Directors. Overall investment goals are established by our Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and members of the ALCO. The Board has delegated the responsibility of monitoring our investment activities to ALCO. Day-to-day activities pertaining to the investment portfolio are conducted within the Company's Treasury division under the supervision of the Chief Investment Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
Risk Management and Oversight
Our Board of Directors oversees our risk management framework. Our Board approves the Company's business plan, risk appetite statement and the policies that set standards for the nature and level of risk the Company is willing to assume. The Board and its established committees receive regular reporting on the Company's management of critical risks and the effectiveness of risk management systems. While our full Board maintains the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management framework, its committees, including the audit committee, the risk committee, the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee, oversee risk in certain specified areas.
Our Board has assigned responsibility to our Chief Risk Officer for maintaining a risk management framework to identify, measure, monitor, control and mitigate risks to the achievement of our strategic goals and objectives and ensure we operate in a safe and sound manner in accordance with the Board's stated risk appetite and Board approved policies. We have invested significant resources to establish a robust enterprise-wide risk management framework to support the planned growth of our Company. Our framework is consistent with common industry practices and regulatory guidance and is appropriate to our size, structure and the complexity of our business activities. Significant elements include a Risk Appetite Statement and risk metrics approved by the Board, ongoing identification and assessments of risk, executive management level risk committees to oversee compliance with the Board approved risk policies and adherence to risk limits, and ongoing testing and reporting by independent internal audit, credit review, and regulatory compliance groups. Executive level oversight of the risk management framework is provided by the Enterprise Risk Management Committee which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and attended by the senior executives of the Company. Reporting to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee are sub-committees 
3

dedicated to guiding and overseeing management of critical categories of risk, including the Credit Risk Management, Asset/Liability, Compliance Risk Management, Operational Risk Management, Corporate Disclosure, Enterprise Data, Ethics, and BSA/AML committees.
Marketing and Distribution
We conduct our banking business through 80 banking centers located in 14 Florida counties, 5 banking centers in the New York metropolitan area, and our national lending and commercial deposit gathering platforms. Our distribution network also includes ATMs, fully integrated on-line banking, mobile banking and a telephone banking service. We target small businesses, middle market and larger commercial enterprises, as well as individual consumers.
In order to market our products, we use local television, radio, digital, print and direct mail advertising as well as a variety of promotional activities.
Competition
Our markets are highly competitive. Our markets contain not only a large number of community and regional banks, but also a significant presence of the country's largest commercial banks. We compete with other state, national and international banks as well as savings associations, savings banks and credit unions with physical presence in our market areas or targeting our market areas digitally for deposits and loans. In addition, we compete with financial intermediaries such as FinTech companies, consumer finance companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, securities firms, mutual funds and several government agencies as well as major retailers, all actively engaged in providing various types of loans and other financial services. Our largest banking competitors in the Florida market include BB&T, JPMorgan Chase, PNC, Regions Bank, SunTrust Bank, TD Bank, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and a number of community banks. In the Tri-State market, we also compete with, in addition to the national and international financial institutions listed, Capital One, Signature Bank, New York Community Bank, Valley National Bank, M&T Bank and numerous community banks.
Interest rates on both loans and deposits and prices of fee-based services are significant competitive factors among financial institutions generally. Other important competitive factors include convenience, quality of customer service, availability of on-line, mobile and remote banking products, community reputation, continuity of personnel and services, and, in the case of larger commercial customers, relative lending limits and ability to offer sophisticated cash management and other commercial banking services. While we continue to provide competitive interest rates on both depository and lending products, we believe that we can compete most successfully by focusing on the financial needs of growing companies and their executives and small and middle-market businesses, offering them a broad range of personalized services and sophisticated cash management tools tailored to their businesses.
Regulation and Supervision
The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. These regulations affect the operations of BankUnited, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Statutes, regulations and policies limit the activities in which we may engage and the conduct of our permitted activities and establish capital requirements with which we must comply. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, borrowers, customers and clients, the FDIC insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of our stockholders or creditors. In many cases, the applicable regulatory authorities have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies, banks and their subsidiaries, including the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations. Further, the regulatory system imposes reporting and information collection obligations. We incur significant costs related to compliance with these laws and regulations. Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies, and a change in them, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material impact on our business. 
The material statutory and regulatory requirements that are applicable to us are summarized below. The description below is not intended to summarize all laws and regulations applicable to us.
Bank and Bank Holding Company Regulation
BankUnited is a national bank. As a national bank organized under the National Bank Act, BankUnited is subject to ongoing and comprehensive supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the OCC.
Any entity that directly or indirectly controls a bank must be approved by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act to become a BHC. BHCs are subject to regulation, inspection, examination, supervision and enforcement by the Federal Reserve 
4

Board under the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve Board's jurisdiction also extends to any company that is directly or indirectly controlled by a BHC.
BankUnited, Inc., which controls BankUnited, is a BHC and, as such, is subject to ongoing and comprehensive supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the Federal Reserve Board.
Broad Supervision, Examination and Enforcement Powers
A principal objective of the U.S. bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banking organizations. To that end, the banking regulators have broad regulatory, examination and enforcement authority. The regulators regularly examine the operations of banking organizations. In addition, banking organizations are subject to periodic reporting requirements.
The regulators have various remedies available if they determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of a banking organization's operations are unsatisfactory. The regulators may also take action if they determine that the banking organization or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation. The regulators have the power to, among other things:

• | enjoin "unsafe or unsound" practices;


• | require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice;


• | issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced;


• | direct increases in capital;


• | direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets;


• | limit dividends and distributions;


• | restrict growth;


• | assess civil monetary penalties;


• | remove officers and directors; and


• | terminate deposit insurance.

The FDIC may terminate a depository institution's deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution's financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution's regulatory agency. Engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements could subject BankUnited, Inc., the Bank and their subsidiaries or their officers, directors and institution-affiliated parties to the remedies described above and other sanctions.
Notice and Approval Requirements Related to Control
Banking laws impose notice, approval, and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect "control" of an FDIC-insured depository institution. These laws include the BHC Act, the Change in Bank Control Act, and the Home Owners' Loan Act. Among other things, these laws require regulatory filings by individuals or companies that seek to acquire direct or indirect "control" of an FDIC-insured depository institution. The determination of whether an investor "controls" a depository institution is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment. As a general matter, a party is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the party owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting stock. Subject to rebuttal, a party may be presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting stock. Ownership by affiliated parties, or parties acting in concert, is typically aggregated for these purposes. If a party's ownership of BankUnited, Inc. were to exceed certain thresholds, the investor could be deemed to "control" the Company for regulatory purposes. This could subject the investor to regulatory filings or other regulatory consequences.
In addition, except under limited circumstances, BHCs are prohibited from acquiring, without prior approval:

• | control of any other bank or BHC or all or substantially all the assets thereof; or


• | more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank or BHC which is not already a subsidiary.

5

Permissible Activities and Investments
Banking laws generally restrict the ability of BankUnited, Inc. to engage in activities other than those determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. The GLB Act expanded the scope of permissible activities for a BHC that qualifies as a financial holding company. Under the regulations implementing the GLB Act, a financial holding company may engage in additional activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity. Those activities include, among other activities, certain insurance and securities activities. BHCs and their subsidiaries must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order for the BHC and its nonbank affiliates to engage in the expanded financial activities permissible only for a financial holding company. BankUnited, Inc. is not a financial holding company.
In addition, as a general matter, the establishment or acquisition by BankUnited, Inc. of a non-bank entity, or the initiation of a non-banking activity, requires prior regulatory approval. In approving acquisitions or the addition of activities, the Federal Reserve Board considers, among other things, whether the acquisition or the additional activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, that outweigh such possible adverse effects as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. 
Regulatory Capital Requirements and Capital Adequacy
The federal bank regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution's financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. The final supervisory determination on an institution's capital adequacy is based on the regulator's assessment of numerous factors. Both BankUnited, Inc. and BankUnited are subject to regulatory capital requirements.
The Federal Reserve Board has established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines for BHCs, including BankUnited, Inc. The OCC has established substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to national banks, including BankUnited. BankUnited, Inc. and BankUnited are subject to capital rules implemented under the framework promulgated by the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel III Capital Rules"). While some provisions of the rules are tailored to larger institutions, the Basel III Capital Rules generally apply to all U.S. banking organizations, including BankUnited, Inc. and BankUnited.
The Basel III Capital Rules provide for the following minimum capital to risk-weighted assets ratios:

(i) | 4.5% based upon CET1;


(ii) | 6.0% based upon tier 1 capital; and


(iii) | 8.0% based upon total regulatory capital.

The Basel III Capital Rules require institutions to retain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these required minimum capital ratio levels. A minimum leverage ratio (tier 1 capital as a percentage of average total assets) of 4.0% is also required under the Basel III Capital Rules. Banking organizations that fail to maintain the minimum required capital conservation buffer could face restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, with distributions and discretionary bonus payments being completely prohibited if no capital conservation buffer exists, or in the event of the following: (i) the banking organization's capital conservation buffer was below 2.5% (or the minimum amount required) at the beginning of a quarter; and (ii) its cumulative net income for the most recent quarterly period plus the preceding four calendar quarters is less than its cumulative capital distributions (as well as associated tax effects not already reflected in net income) during the same measurement period.

Prompt Corrective Action
Under the FDIA, the federal bank regulatory agencies must take "prompt corrective action" against undercapitalized U.S. depository institutions. U.S. depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," and "critically undercapitalized," and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls. As of December 31, 2018, a depository institution was deemed to be "well capitalized" if the banking institution had a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and the institution was not subject to an order, written agreement, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure. Under certain circumstances, a well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. A banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including: termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, restrictions on certain business activities, and appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver. As of December 31, 2018, BankUnited, Inc. and BankUnited were well capitalized.
Source of strength
All companies, including BHCs, that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution are required to serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under this requirement, BankUnited, Inc. in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to BankUnited should it experience financial distress. Such support may be required at times when, absent this statutory and Federal Reserve Policy requirement, a BHC may not be inclined to provide it.
Regulatory Limits on Dividends and Distributions
Federal law currently imposes limitations upon certain capital distributions by national banks, such as certain cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to stockholders of another institution in a cash-out merger and other distributions charged against capital. The Federal Reserve Board and OCC regulate all capital distributions by BankUnited directly or indirectly to BankUnited, Inc., including dividend payments.
BankUnited may not pay dividends to BankUnited, Inc. if, after paying those dividends, it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage capital ratio requirements, or in the event the OCC notified BankUnited that it was in need of more than normal supervision. Under the FDIA, an insured depository institution such as BankUnited is prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become "undercapitalized." Payment of dividends by BankUnited also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the appropriate regulator if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice.
BankUnited is subject to supervisory limits on its ability to declare or pay a dividend or reduce its capital unless certain conditions are satisfied.
In addition, it is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that BHCs should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that BHCs should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the BHC’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries.
Reserve Requirements
Pursuant to regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, all banking organizations are required to maintain average daily reserves at mandated ratios against their transaction accounts. In addition, reserves must be maintained on certain non-personal time deposits. These reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in an account at a Federal Reserve Bank.
Limits on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
Insured depository institutions are subject to restrictions on their ability to conduct transactions with affiliates and other related parties. Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative limits, qualitative requirements, and collateral requirements on certain transactions by an insured depository institution with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates. Transactions covered by Section 23A include loans, extensions of credit, investment in securities issued by an affiliate, and acquisitions of assets from an affiliate. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act requires that most types of transactions by an insured depository institution with, or for the benefit of, an affiliate be on terms at least as favorable to the insured depository institution as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third party.
7

The Federal Reserve Board's Regulation O and OCC regulations impose restrictions and procedural requirements in connection with the extension of credit by an insured depository institution to directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and their related interests.
The Volcker Rule
The Volcker Rule generally prohibits "banking entities" from engaging in "proprietary trading" and making investments and conducting certain other activities with "covered funds."
Although the rule provides for some tiering of compliance and reporting obligations based on size, the fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of any size, including BankUnited, Inc. and BankUnited. Banking entities with total assets of $10 billion or more that engage in activities subject to the Volcker Rule are required to establish a compliance program to address the prohibitions of, and exemptions from, the Volcker Rule. The banking agencies have proposed rules that would tailor a banking organization's Volcker compliance program based on the extent of the banking entity's trading assets and liabilities.
Corporate governance
The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that affect most U.S. publicly traded companies, including BankUnited, Inc. The Dodd-Frank Act (1) granted stockholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; (2) enhanced independence requirements for compensation committee members; (3) required companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive-based compensation claw-back policies for executive officers; and (4) provided the SEC with authority to adopt proxy access rules that would allow stockholders of publicly traded companies to nominate candidates for election as a director and have those nominees included in a company's proxy materials.
Examination Fees
The OCC currently charges fees to recover the costs of examining national banks, processing applications and other filings, and covering direct and indirect expenses in regulating national banks. Various regulatory agencies have the authority to assess additional supervision fees.
FDIC Deposit Insurance
The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures the deposits of federally insured depository institutions up to applicable limits. The FDIC also has certain regulatory, examination and enforcement powers with respect to FDIC-insured institutions. The deposits of BankUnited are insured by the FDIC up to applicable limits. As a general matter, the maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor.
Additionally, FDIC-insured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC. The amount of a particular institution's deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution's risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution's risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators. 
Depositor Preference
The FDIA provides that, in the event of the "liquidation or other resolution" of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. Insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including BankUnited, Inc., with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
Federal Reserve System and Federal Home Loan Bank System
As a national bank, BankUnited is required to hold shares of capital stock in a Federal Reserve Bank. BankUnited holds capital stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. As a member of the Federal Reserve System, BankUnited has access to the Federal Reserve discount window lending and payment clearing systems.
BankUnited is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. Each FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. Any advances from a FHLB 
8

must be secured by specified types of collateral. As a member of the FHLB, BankUnited is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta. BankUnited is in compliance with this requirement.
Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC
Under federal law, financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures, and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification in their dealings with non-U.S. financial institutions and non-U.S. customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution's compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions. The regulatory authorities have imposed "cease and desist" orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury's OFAC is responsible for helping to insure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations, and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If BankUnited, Inc. or BankUnited finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, BankUnited, Inc. or BankUnited must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.
Consumer Laws and Regulations
Banking organizations are subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect consumers. These laws include, among others:

• | Truth in Lending Act;


• | Truth in Savings Act;


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act;


• | Expedited Funds Availability Act;


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act;

Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition to, those listed above. These federal, state and local laws regulate the manner in which financial institutions deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, or conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by state and local attorneys general, and civil or criminal liability.

CFPB
The CFPB is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank and thrift consumers. For banking organizations with assets of $10 billion or more, such as BankUnited, Inc. and the Bank, the CFPB has exclusive rule making and examination, and primary enforcement authority under federal consumer financial law. In addition, states are permitted to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB.
The Community Reinvestment Act
The CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The bank regulators examine and assign each bank a public CRA rating.
The CRA requires bank regulators to take into account the bank's record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering an application by a bank to establish or relocate a branch or to conduct certain mergers or acquisitions. The Federal Reserve Board is required to consider the CRA records of a BHC's controlled banks when considering an application by the BHC to acquire a banking organization or to merge with another BHC. If BankUnited, Inc. or BankUnited applies for regulatory approval to make certain investments, the regulators will consider the CRA record of target institutions and BankUnited, Inc.'s depository institution subsidiaries. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay approval or result in denial of an application. The regulatory agency's assessment of the institution's record is made available to the public. Following its most recent CRA examination in September 2015, BankUnited received an overall rating of "Satisfactory."
