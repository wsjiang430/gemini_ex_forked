ITEM 1. Business
General
Newpark Resources, Inc. was organized in 1932 as a Nevada corporation. In 1991, we changed our state of incorporation to Delaware. We are a geographically diversified supplier providing products, rentals, and services primarily to the oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) industry. We operate our business through two reportable segments: Fluids Systems and Mats and Integrated Services. Our Fluids Systems segment provides customized fluids solutions to E&P customers globally, operating through four geographic regions: North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Latin America, and Asia Pacific. Our Mats and Integrated Services segment provides composite mat rentals utilized for temporary worksite access, along with site construction and related site services to customers in various markets including E&P, electrical transmission & distribution, pipeline, solar, petrochemical, and construction industries across North America and Europe. We also sell composite mats to customers around the world.

Industry Fundamentals
Our operating results depend, to a large extent, on oil and natural gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve, and particularly for the Fluids Systems segment, the nature of the drilling operations (including the depth and whether the wells are drilled vertically or horizontally), which governs the revenue potential of each well. Drilling activity levels, in turn, depend on a variety of factors, including oil and natural gas commodity pricing, inventory levels, product demand, and regulatory restrictions. Oil and natural gas prices and activity are cyclical and volatile and this market volatility has a significant impact on our operating results. Beginning late 2014 and continuing through early 2016, the price of oil declined dramatically from the price levels in prior years. As a result, E&P drilling activity levels significantly declined in North America and many global markets over this period. Oil prices and drilling activity have since improved from the lows reached in early 2016, but remain lower than pre-downturn levels and continue to be volatile. While our revenue potential is driven by a number of factors including those described above, rig count data remains the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity. The average Baker Hughes North America Rotary Rig Count was 1,223 in 2018, compared to 1,083 in 2017, and 639 in 2016. 
The declining E&P drilling activity levels in 2015 and 2016 reduced the demand for our services, negatively impacted customer pricing, and resulted in elevated costs associated with workforce reductions, all of which negatively impacted our profitability. Further, due to the fact that our business contains substantial levels of fixed costs, including significant facility and personnel expenses, North American operating margins in both operating segments were negatively impacted by the lower customer demand during this period.
Outside of North America, drilling activity is generally more stable as drilling activity in many countries is based on longer-term economic projections and multi-year drilling programs, which tends to reduce the impact of short-term changes in commodity prices on overall drilling activity. Although drilling activity levels in certain of our international markets have declined in recent years, as a whole, our international activities have remained relatively stable, primarily driven by key contracts with national oil companies. International expansion, including the penetration of international oil companies ("IOCs") and national oil companies ("NOCs"), is a key element of our Fluids Systems strategy.
In addition to our international expansion efforts, we are also expanding our presence in North America, capitalizing on our capabilities, infrastructure, and strong market position in the North American land drilling fluids markets to expand our drilling fluids presence within the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as well as our presence in adjacent product offerings, including completion fluids and stimulation chemicals.

Our Mats and Integrated Services segment serves a variety of industries in addition to the E&P industry, including the electrical transmission & distribution, pipeline, solar, petrochemical, and construction industries. The demand for our products and services from customers in these industries is driven, in part, by infrastructure construction and maintenance activity levels in these industries within the U.S. 
Reportable Segments
Fluids Systems
Our Fluids Systems segment provides drilling and completion fluids products and technical services to customers in the North America, EMEA, Latin America, and Asia Pacific regions. We offer customized solutions for highly technical drilling projects involving complex subsurface conditions such as horizontal, directional, geologically deep, or drilling in deep water. These projects require increased monitoring and critical engineering support of the fluids system during the drilling process. In addition, our Fluids Systems offering is expanding into adjacent areas of chemistry, including stimulation chemicals, which are utilized extensively by E&P operators in the U.S. to stimulate hydrocarbon production.
We also have industrial mineral grinding operations for barite, a critical raw material in drilling fluids products, which serve to support our activities in the North American drilling fluids market. We grind barite and other industrial minerals at four facilities, including locations in Texas, Louisiana, and Tennessee. We use the resulting products in our drilling fluids business and also sell them to third party users, including other drilling fluids companies. We also sell a variety of other minerals, principally to third-party industrial (non-oil and natural gas) markets.
Raw Materials — We believe that our sources of supply for materials and equipment used in our drilling fluids business are adequate for our needs, however, we have experienced periods of short-term scarcity of barite ore, which have resulted in significant cost increases. Our specialty milling operation is our primary supplier of barite used in our North American drilling fluids business. Our mills obtain raw barite ore under supply agreements from foreign sources, primarily China and India. We obtain other materials used in the drilling fluids business from various third-party suppliers. We have encountered no significant shortages or delays in obtaining these raw materials. 
Technology — Proprietary technology and systems, such as our Kronos™ deepwater drilling fluid systems, are an important aspect of our business strategy. We seek patents and licenses on new developments whenever we believe it creates a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We own patent rights in a family of high-performance water-based fluids systems, which we market as Evolution® and DeepDrill® systems, which are designed to enhance drilling performance and provide environmental benefits. We also rely on a variety of unpatented proprietary technologies and know-how in many of our applications. We believe that our reputation in the industry, the range of services we offer, ongoing technical development and know-how, responsiveness to customers, and understanding of regulatory requirements are of equal or greater competitive significance than our existing proprietary rights.
Competition — We face competition from larger companies, including Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes, a GE Company, which compete vigorously on fluids performance and/or price. In addition, these companies have broad product and service offerings in addition to their drilling fluids. We also have smaller regional competitors competing with us primarily on price and local relationships. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our businesses include a combination of technical proficiency, reputation, price, reliability, quality, breadth of services offered, and experience, and that our competitive position is enhanced by our proprietary products and services.
Customers — Our customers are principally major integrated and independent oil and natural gas E&P companies operating in the markets that we serve. During 2018, approximately 51% of segment revenues were derived from the 20 largest segment customers, of which the largest customer represented 10% of our segment revenues. The segment also generated 57% of its revenues domestically during 2018. In North America, we primarily perform services either under short-term standard contracts or under “master” service agreements. Internationally, some customers issue multi-year contracts, but many are on a well-by-well or project basis. As most agreements with our customers can be terminated upon short notice, our backlog is not significant. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenues from government contracts.
Mats and Integrated Services
Our Mats and Integrated Services segment provides composite mat rentals utilized for temporary worksite access, along with site construction and related site services to customers in various markets including E&P, electrical transmission & distribution, pipeline, solar, petrochemical, and construction industries across North America and Europe. We also sell composite mats to customers around the world. The Mats and Integrated Services segment revenues from non-E&P markets represented approximately half of our segment revenues in 2018.
We manufacture our DURA-BASE® Advanced Composite Mats for use in our rental operations as well as for third-party sales. Our matting systems provide environmental protection and ensure all-weather access to sites with unstable soil conditions. We continue to expand our product offerings, which now include the EPZ Grounding System™ for enhanced safety and efficiency

for contractors working on power line maintenance and construction projects and the T-REX™ automated mat cleaning system to provide customers with a cost effective system to clean composite mats on site. 
In November 2017, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Well Service Group, Inc. and Utility Access Solutions, Inc. (together, “WSG”). Since 2012, WSG had been a strategic logistics and installation service provider for our Mats and Integrated Service segment, offering a variety of complementary services to our composite matting systems, including access road construction, site planning and preparation, environmental protection, fluids and spill storage/containment, erosion control, and site restoration services. The completion of the WSG acquisition expanded our service offering as well as our geographic footprint across the Northeast, Midwest, Rockies, and West Texas regions of the U.S. 
Raw Materials — The resins, chemicals, and other materials used to manufacture composite mats are widely available. Resin is the largest material component in the manufacturing of our composite mat products. We believe that our sources of supply for materials used in our business are adequate for our needs. We are not dependent upon any one supplier and we have encountered no significant shortages or delays in obtaining any raw materials.
Technology — We have obtained patents related to the design and manufacturing of our DURA-BASE mats and several of the components, as well as other products and systems related to these mats (including the connecting pins and the EPZ Grounding System™). Using proprietary technology and systems is an important aspect of our business strategy. We believe that these products provide us with a distinct advantage over our competition. While we continue to add to our patent portfolio, two patents related to our DURA-BASE matting system will expire in May 2020, and competitors may begin offering mats that include features described in those patents. We believe that our reputation in the industry, the range of services we offer, ongoing technical development and know-how, responsiveness to customers, and understanding of regulatory requirements also have competitive significance in the markets we serve.
Competition — Our market is fragmented and competitive, with many competitors providing various forms of site preparation products and services. The mat sales component of our business is not as fragmented as the rental and services components with only a few competitors providing various alternatives to our DURA-BASE mat products, such as Signature Systems Group and ISOKON. This is due to many factors, including large capital start-up costs and proprietary technology associated with this product. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our businesses include product capabilities, price, reputation, and reliability, and that our competitive position is enhanced by our proprietary products, services, and experience.
Customers — Our customers are principally oil and natural gas E&P companies, utility companies, and infrastructure construction companies operating in the markets that we serve. During 2018, approximately 70% of our segment revenues were derived from the 20 largest segment customers, of which the two largest customers represented 12% and 11%, respectively, of our segment revenues. The segment also generated 94% of its revenues domestically during 2018. As a result of our efforts to expand beyond our traditional oilfield customer base, revenues from non-E&P markets represented approximately half of our segment revenues in 2018. Typically, we perform services either under short-term contracts or rental service agreements. As most agreements with our customers are cancelable upon short notice, our backlog is not significant. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenues from government contracts.
Employees
At January 31, 2019, we employed approximately 2,500 full and part-time personnel, none of which are represented by unions. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
Environmental Regulation
We seek to comply with all applicable legal requirements concerning environmental matters. Our business is affected by governmental regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry in general, as well as environmental, health, and safety regulations that have specific application to our business. Our activities are impacted by various federal and state regulatory agencies, and provincial pollution control, health, and safety programs that are administered and enforced by regulatory agencies.
Additionally, our business exposes us to environmental risks. We have implemented various procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and reduce the risk of damage or loss. These include specified handling procedures and guidelines for waste, ongoing employee training, and monitoring, as well as maintaining insurance coverage.
We also employ a corporate-wide web-based health, safety, and environmental management system (“HSEMS”). The HSEMS is designed to capture information related to the planning, decision-making, and general operations of environmental regulatory activities within our operations. We also use the HSEMS to capture the information generated by regularly scheduled independent audits that are performed to validate the findings of our internal monitoring and auditing procedures.
