Divisions 
 
Bisco Industries 
 
Bisco sells a broad spectrum of products that it offers to many markets, but primarily sells to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). While historically, the substantial majority of Bisco’s revenues have been derived from the Bisco Industries division, Bisco has also established additional divisions that specialize in specific industries and products. Bisco believes that the focus by industry and/or product enhances Bisco’s ability to provide superior service and devise tailored solutions for its customers.
 
National-Precision 
 
The National-Precision division primarily sells electronic hardware and commercial fasteners to OEMs in the aerospace, fabrication and industrial equipment industries. National-Precision seeks to be the leading global distributor of mil-spec and commercial fasteners, hardware and distribution services used in production.
 
Fast-Cor 
 
The Fast-Cor division was established to be a distributor’s source for a broad range of components and fasteners. Fast-Cor has access to the entire inventory of products that Bisco offers but primarily focuses on selling to other distributors, not manufacturers.
 
Customers and Sales
 
Bisco’s customers operate in a wide variety of industries and range from large, global companies to small local businesses. Bisco strives to provide exceptional service to all customers, including smaller businesses, and continues to focus on growing its share of that market. As of August 31, 2019, Bisco had more than 10,000 customers; however, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Bisco’s revenues for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019.
