Item 1. Business 
Overview
 Our vision is digital life for everyday items. We are driving toward a future in which everyday physical items have digital counterparts, digital twins, in the cloud, and in which businesses and people engage with trillions of those everyday physical items via their digital twins. Our mission is to deliver a platform that powers that item-to-cloud connectivity, enabling developers to innovate Internet-of-Things, or IoT, applications on our platform. Today, we deliver the identity, location and authenticity of billions of physical items; our future is enabling those cloud-based digital twins, each storing an individual item’s ownership, history and links, and enabling ubiquitous access to them. We believe the item-to-cloud connectivity we will deliver will enhance businesses efficiencies and commerce and, ultimately, improve peoples’ lives.
Opportunity
 Our platform connects individual items, capturing and delivering data about each item from manufacturing, through distribution to sale. We envision a future where we extend and deliver an item’s digital life to the person that purchases and owns it. We and our channel partners connect items via a miniature radio chip embedded in the item or in its packaging, reading and delivering the item’s unique identity, location and authenticity to business and consumer applications. To date, we have enabled connectivity to more than 30 billion items, enabling retailers, hospitals, airlines, automotive manufacturers, supply chain and logistics, and business in many other industries to derive timely business value from those connected items. Our opportunity is to connect billions, ultimately possibly trillions of everyday items, and to deliver valuable information about these items not just to businesses, but also to everyday people.
 Our platform connects everyday items using RAIN, a radio-frequency identification, or RFID, technology we pioneered. We spearheaded development of the RAIN radio standard, lobbied governments to allocate frequency spectrum and cofounded the RAIN Industry Alliance which today has more than 160-member companies. Today, the RAIN RFID industry uses the RAIN radio standard nearly exclusively, has access to radio spectrum freely available in 78 countries encompassing roughly 96.5% of the world’s GDP and has connected tens of billions of items. We believe RAIN’s core capabilities – unique identifiers for individual items, battery-free operation, low cost, 30-feet range, not line-of-sight, 1,000 reads per second, designed to have essentially unlimited life and available cryptographic item authentication – position RAIN to be the leading item-to-cloud connectivity technology for the IoT.
 RAIN market adoption has historically been slower than anticipated or forecasted by us and industry sources. For additional information related to RAIN market adoption, please see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors.”
 Impinj Platform
 Our platform comprises endpoint integrated circuits, or ICs, connectivity and software that together deliver item data to business applications. We link the layers of our platform to deliver advanced capabilities and performance that surpasses mix-and-match solutions built from competitor products. Within each layer we sell one or more product families.
 Endpoint ICs
 Our endpoint IC product family, branded Monza, comprises a family of miniature radios-on-a-chip that attach-to and uniquely identify their host items. Monza ICs include a number to identify a host item and may also include features such as user data storage, security, authentication, loss prevention, consumer privacy and value-added Impinj custom features, all accessible by our platform. Our Monza ICs power themselves from a reader’s radio waves so they do not need a battery, can wirelessly connect almost any item, are readable at distances up to 30 feet without line-of-sight, yet sell for pennies.
 4

Our original equipment manufacturing, or OEM, partners typically attach each Monza IC to a thin printed or etched antenna on a paper or Mylar backing, then cover the composite inlay with a paper face to form a tag. End customers attach the tag to an item in markets including retail, healthcare, automotive, supply chain and logistics, industrial and manufacturing, consumer experience, food, datacenter, travel and banking. In some more-recent applications, rather than attaching a tag to an item, end customers may instead embed the inlay directly into the item, for example, sewing an inlay into a garment’s care label. Regardless of the method by which our partners embed a Monza IC into a host item, we refer to a Monza IC and its host item as an endpoint.
 When a consumer purchases a retail item, a store or supplier typically procures another item to sell, including another Monza IC. We believe endpoint ICs are the first market for consumable silicon and are a recurring revenue source for us.
 Connectivity
 Our connectivity offering comprises a family of reader ICs and modules, readers and gateways that wirelessly identify, locate, authenticate and engage items. Our connectivity products wirelessly provide power to, and communicate bidirectionally with, endpoint ICs on those items, identifying and locating up to 1,000 items per second.
 Readers read, write, authenticate or otherwise engage endpoint ICs on items. Gateways integrate stationary readers with scanning antennas to locate and track items. Our readers and gateways are easy to deploy and use, can be powered via power-over-Ethernet and are certified for operation in more than 40 countries. Our customers have deployed our readers and gateways in applications ranging from retail inventory-taking to automated fuel filling to shipping-container tracking to airport luggage handling.
 Our reader ICs and modules, branded Indy, comprise a suite of ICs and modules, the latter combining our reader ICs with peripheral circuitry in an easy-to-use format. We sell our reader ICs and modules to OEM and original design manufacturing, or ODM, partners that use them in a variety of products such as mobile or handheld readers, fixed readers, gateway, and RAIN-enabled appliances. We offer easy-to-use APIs, development environments, sample code, drivers and libraries. We sell our reader ICs and modules for tens of dollars.
 Our reader product family, branded Speedway, comprises high-performance finished products. We sell our Speedway readers through an established channel of distributors, system integrators, or SIs, value-added resellers, or VARs, and solution providers. Our readers sell for hundreds of dollars.
 Our gateway product family integrates our Speedway readers with beamforming antennas to electrically steer a radio beam like a searchlight. Their always-on, autonomous operation delivers timely item data without ongoing labor costs. Our portal gateways, branded xPortal and xSpan, scan doorways or hallways such as front-to-back store transitions, entryways and exits. Our array gateway, branded xArray, scans up to 1,500 square feet of floor space such as in a store, manufacturing facility or a hospital room. Our gateways sell for thousands of dollars.
 Software
 Our primary software offering, ItemSense, is a distributed operating system for our platform. ItemSense transforms item-level RAIN data into actionable business information, enabling analytics and insights about items businesses manufacture, transport and sell. ItemSense’s key capabilities include enterprise-class RAIN deployment management and health monitoring; software-defined algorithms for item inventory, location and motion determination; and easy-to-use and integrate APIs that enable application developers to quickly build powerful IoT solutions on our platform.
Industry Use Cases
 The following use cases are representative of actual RAIN deployments we serve today.

Retail
 Retailers, both traditional “brick-and-mortar” and online, are consuming billions of tags each year to obtain real-time data about products they manufacture, transport and sell. By using our platform retailers can obtain these benefits: 

• | Inventory Accuracy and Visibility. Our platform delivers accurate and timely data about a retailer’s inventory, delivering visibility into what items a retailer has and where the items are located. Accurate inventory data can reduce overstocks and understocks, eliminate searching and avoid confusion, thereby allowing staff to focus on customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Omnichannel Operations. Omnichannel retailing is about selling products when, where and how customers want to buy—but retailers can’t sell what they can’t see. The cornerstone of a successful omnichannel operation is real-time inventory visibility that provides accurate item information in stores and distribution and fulfillment centers. With real-time inventory visibility delivered by our platform, omnichannel retailers can efficiently sell inventory distributed across all their retail locations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Store Operations. Accurate inventory data are key to an efficient, optimized retail organization. But many retailers are stuck doing things the old way—manually counting items, and the data are outdated soon after they complete a cycle count. The Impinj platform delivers timely information about items in retail stores and warehouses, enabling retailers to confidently sell down to the last item in stock, know what products are popular, and help customers shop in their stores.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced Shopper Experiences. Capturing customers’ attention as they step foot into a store with seamless interactive item-based experiences helps sell those items. The Impinj platform enables interactive in-store applications such as digital signs, magic mirrors and self-checkout kiosks. These interactive applications grab customers’ attention, provide information during the buying decision and keep shoppers engaged in the store.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Loss Identification and Analytics. The same platform capabilities that give retailers inventory visibility can also improve loss prevention. With the Impinj platform, retailers can be alerted when items enter or leave specific zones within a store. Item identification, location and movement data can help retailers make smart decisions to protect their inventory and avoid lost sales due to missing inventory.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supply Chain and Logistics
 The supply chain and logistics industry is increasingly demanding smarter, simpler and more automated operations. Using the Impinj platform they can obtain these benefits: 
  
• | Shipment Verification. The Impinj platform provides real-time data about items passing through dock doors to the systems that run shipping and receiving, enabling logistics companies to reduce mistakes, automate processes and drive operational efficiencies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Returnable Transit Item (RTI) Tracking. By tagging RTI containers that travel in and out of warehouses, the Impinj platform can reduce RTI loss and ensures a business has the RTI containers it needs to satisfy its customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Asset Management. The Impinj platform enables automated check-in and -out procedures, maintenance alerts and location monitoring, improving efficiencies, reducing loss and complying with maintenance schedules.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

enhancing our algorithms and capabilities for item authentication, loss prevention and shipment verification; and reducing costs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drive End-User Adoption. We plan to deepen our platform integration with software partners, broaden our partner ecosystem and expand our solutions focus and offerings, focused on driving end-user adoption.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand within our Customer Base by Cross-Selling and Up-Selling Our Platform. We will seek additional revenue from existing end users of our platform by helping them expand their deployment scope and add new use cases. For example, typical retailer RAIN deployments start by tagging primarily apparel items and taking inventory using handheld readers. We see opportunities not only to expand tagging to housewares, appliances, cosmetics and eventually all items in a store, but also to automate inventory-taking using fixed reading and to deliver enhanced use cases such as omnichannel fulfillment, loss prevention and more.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enable Ubiquitous Reading. We plan to invest in next-generation reader ICs to improve functionality, reduce costs, and make Impinj-based readers ubiquitous in industrial and consumer devices and facilities infrastructure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
 Our go-to-market model prioritizes brand development, end-user awareness, lead generation and sales enablement. Our communications use web, electronic and channel programs complemented by press initiatives and industry-analyst relationships. Our solutions-marketing, business-development and solutions-architecture teams work with our partner independent software vendors, or ISVs, to enable joint solutions and go-to-market selling.
 We deliver products and solutions that are easy for our partner ecosystem to sell and deploy. We engender preference for our platform in all sales engagements, encouraging end users to deploy our multiple products to gain full benefit from our platform. Our business development, product marketing, technical and systems engineers all actively engage partners and end customers.
 Our sales force leverages a global partner ecosystem of distributors, SIs, VARs and ISV partners. We also have a number of worldwide sales team members with expertise in endpoint ICs and reader ICs and modules. Because our operating-system software is still relatively new to the market, the revenue we derive from software is small, so we currently derive most of our revenue from endpoint IC and connectivity product sales. We sell our products as follows:
  
• | Endpoint ICs directly to inlay and tag OEMs and ODMs. We typically negotiate pricing, volumes and deliveries with these OEMs and ODMs annually, with new pricing effective during the first quarter of the calendar year.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reader ICs and modules primarily through distribution to reader OEMs and ODMs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Readers and gateways primarily to VARs and SIs through distributors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Software through distributors, VARs, SIs and other software-solution partners.

 We engage directly with end users in collaboration with partners across our ecosystem, usually fulfilling sales through those same partners. In some instances, these end-customer engagements leverage go-to-market relationships with companies who do not sell our products but whose product offerings complement ours. Many of our partners sell multiple of our products or our entire platform.
 Manufacturing
 We outsource all our product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers that build our products to our design specifications. This capital-efficient operating model scales efficiently with volume, allowing us to focus our resources on accelerating development of new products and solutions.
 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, fabricates our endpoint IC wafers in Asia and the United States and has been our sole endpoint IC wafer supplier since 2003. We order endpoint IC wafers on a purchase-order basis and do not have a long-term agreement with TSMC. We test the wafers at our U.S. headquarters and in Asia. We use multiple subcontractors to post-process the wafers, with Stars Microelectronics (Thailand) Public Company Limited, or Stars, our primary subcontractor. We generally engage all our endpoint IC subcontractors on a purchase-order basis.
 TowerJazz Ltd., or TowerJazz fabricates our reader IC wafers in the United States and has been our sole reader IC wafer supplier since 2008. We order reader IC wafers on a purchase-order basis and do not have a long-term agreement with TowerJazz. We use subcontractors on a purchase-order basis to package the ICs and test the packaged parts. Stars and Microelectronics Technology Inc., or MTI, manufacture our modules. We do not have a long-term manufacturing agreement with either. 
 Plexus Corp., or Plexus, manufactures our readers in Asia and has been our sole supplier since 2005. Plexus and Western Corporation (acquired by Computrol, Inc.) in the United States have manufactured our gateways since 2013 and 2010, respectively. We order readers and gateways pursuant to non-exclusive purchase agreements that renew automatically each year, subject to each party’s right to terminate upon 180 days’ notice. We engage subcontractors on a purchase-order basis to assemble and test printed circuit boards, to build our reader and gateway enclosures and test our readers and gateways.
 Research and Development
 We built our company around technology leadership and innovation. We have committed, and plan to continue committing, significant resources to technology and product innovation and development. We achieved our market leadership by innovating, delivering and continuously improving product performance, features, quality and reliability while also reducing costs. In most situations, we strive to lead the market with new innovations, but we sometimes adopt a “fast follower” approach depending on the market situation. As one example, endpoint IC performance typically improves when we migrate the semiconductor processing to more advanced process nodes. We execute these node migrations when the development costs, performance improvements, competitive situation and product cost reductions justify the migration. But external factors, such as the ability of our OEM and ODM partners to process larger wafers with smaller ICs can cause us to delay, or even allow our competition to temporarily lead, while we develop advanced products that we introduce when our OEM and ODM partners are ready. 
 9

We have assembled a team of skilled engineers and currently perform all research and most of our product development internally. As of December 31, 2018, we had 122 employees in research and development. We regularly review our technology, products and market development opportunities and reallocate our spending and resources accordingly.
 Intellectual Property
 We protect our technologies by filing patent applications, retaining trade secrets and defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights where appropriate. To date, our intellectual property portfolio includes 247 issued and allowed U.S. patents, two issued and allowed international patents, 27 pending U.S. patent applications and one pending international patent application. The first of our 221 issued utility patents expire in 2022 and the first of our 26 issued design patents expire in 2021. To protect confidential information not otherwise subject to patent protection, we rely on trade secret law and enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and partners.
 Because most RAIN product SKUs are used in, or imported into, the United States, and because many of our partners and end customers have U.S. operations, we believe U.S. patents hold the most value for our business. Consequently, we have filed primarily U.S. patent applications. We have two issued and allowed international patents. Because our portfolio currently comprises mostly U.S. patents, we have limited ability to assert our intellectual property rights outside the United States.
 Although our patents and trade secrets constitute valuable assets, we do not view any one of them as material. Instead, we believe the totality of our patent and trade-secret portfolio creates an advantage for our business.
 We have entered into licensing, broad-scope cross licensing and other agreements authorizing us to use or to operate within the scope of patents and intellectual property owned by third parties. For example, we have licenses to third-party intellectual property that we use in our products. As another example, by participating in developing GS1 EPCglobal protocols, such as the RAIN radio protocol, we agreed to license those of our patents necessarily infringed by the practice of these protocols on a royalty-free basis to other GS1 EPCglobal members, subject to reciprocal royalty-free rights from those members. By participating in developing International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, standards, we agreed to grant to all users worldwide a license to those of our patents necessarily infringed by the practice of several ISO standards, including non-RAIN standards, on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, subject to reciprocity.
 We own a number of trademarks, develop names for our new products and secure trademark protection for them, including domain name registration, in relevant jurisdictions.
 Alliances and Standardization
 Our platform connects everyday items using the RAIN RFID technology we pioneered. We spearheaded development of the RAIN radio standard, lobbied governments to allocate frequency spectrum and, along with Google, Intel and Smartrac, cofounded the RAIN Industry Alliance. Our chief executive officer is presently an Alliance Director and was previously the Alliance Chairman. The Alliance is a global organization promoting the universal adoption of RAIN technology and solutions with more than 160 members as of December 31, 2018. The name “RAIN” connotes ubiquity and a close link to cloud data. Today, the RAIN RFID industry has access to radio spectrum freely available in 78 countries encompassing roughly 96.5% of the world’s GDP and has connected tens of billions of items. We believe RAIN’s core capabilities – unique identifiers for individual items, battery-free operation, low cost, long range, not line-of-sight, 1,000 reads per second, designed to have essentially unlimited life and available cryptographic item authentication – position RAIN to be the leading item-to-cloud connectivity technology for the IoT.
 We, our customers, partners and competitors developed the RAIN radio protocol, whose technical name is EPC™ Radio-Frequency Identity Protocols Generation-2 UHF RFID (standardized as ISO/IEC 18000-63 and known colloquially as Gen2) in 2004, with us as the editor. Our community delivered a backwards-compatible update in 2013, again with us as the editor. Our industry uses the RAIN radio protocol nearly exclusively.
 By participating in GS1 EPCglobal, which produced Gen2, and ISO, which ratified 18000-63, as well as in other standards bodies, we agreed to license certain patents as described in the section captioned “Intellectual Property.”
 10

Government Regulations
 Government regulations require us to certify our readers and gateways in jurisdictions where they operate. For example, we certify our readers and gateways to Federal Communications Commission regulations to operate in the United States and its territories. Currently, our Speedway readers are certified for operation in more than 40 countries worldwide including the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, South Korea and all of the European Union. Our gateway products have the same or fewer certifications, depending on the recency of the product introduction; we plan to eventually certify them in all countries with compelling market opportunities.
Competition
 We believe we are the only company in our industry with a platform spanning endpoint ICs, connectivity and software. Individual competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of the platform layers. Our principal competition in our platform layers include:

• | Endpoint ICs. NXP B.V., or NXP, and Alien Technology Corporation, or Alien.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reader ICs. STMicroelectronics N.V., Phychips Inc and Zhikun Semiconductor Co. Ltd, or Iotelligent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Readers and Gateways. Alien, which also purchases our reader ICs, and Zebra Technologies Corporation, or Zebra.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Software. Zebra and Mojix, Inc.
--+--------------------------------

 The market for our platform and products is relatively new and highly competitive. We believe competition will increase as the market grows and RAIN technology continues to advance. New entrants could come into our market at any time, creating additional competition in the future. The competitive factors that impact our platform and product sales include:
  
• | portfolio, performance, features, lead times, reliability and price;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | support, ease of use and availability of reference designs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | development tools and API availability (except in the endpoint IC market);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | integration and certification with end-user applications; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | company reputation.
--+--------------------

 Although we believe we compete favorably on the above factors, our future competitiveness will depend upon our ability to design, develop and deliver compelling solutions. We occasionally experience competitive pressures due to prevailing exchange rates as our product pricing is denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, our competitive position depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain talent while protecting our intellectual property. For additional information on the risks associated with our business, see “Risk Factors.”
