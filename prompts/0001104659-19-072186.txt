Overview
 
Using its proprietary large-scale PCR based manufacturing technology and systems, Applied DNA Sciences Inc. (“Applied DNA”, the “Company” or “we”) manufactures large quantities of linear DNA for use in its proprietary products as well as for sale to third parties. The Company manufactures non-biological DNA-based molecular taggants for use in its proprietary supply chain security, anticounterfeiting, brand protection and law enforcement products.  With secure non-biological taggants, high-resolution DNA authentication, and comprehensive reporting, the Company’s SigNature® molecular taggant technologies deliver what we believe to be the greatest levels of security, deterrence and legal recourse strength, making Applied DNA a leader in supply chain provenance technologies. The Company’s 98% percent owned subsidiary LineaRx, Inc. (“LRx”) manufactures larger DNA constructs used in preclinical biotherapeutic applications, which are primarily sold to third parties. Through LRx, the Company supplies PCR produced linear DNA for use in preclinical biotherapeutic applications including CAR T/TCR, RNA manufacture, DNA-based vaccines and gene therapies, as well as in vitro diagnostics. LRx seeks to supplant the use of plasmid derived DNA with PCR-produced linear DNA in biotherapeutic and diagnostic applications, and to develop, acquire and commercialize, alone or with partners, a diverse portfolio of nucleic acid-based biotherapeutics and diagnostics that we believe will improve the efficacy, safety and cost of existing and newly developed biotherapeutics and diagnostics.
