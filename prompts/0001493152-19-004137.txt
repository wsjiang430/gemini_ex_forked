Item 1. Business
General
 
Processa is an emerging pharmaceutical company focused on the clinical development of drug products that are intended to improve the survival and/or quality of life for patients who have a high unmet medical need. Within this group of pharmaceutical products, we currently are developing one product for multiple indications (i.e., the use of a drug to treat a particular disease) and searching for additional products for our portfolio.
 
Part of our business strategy is:
 

(i) | to identify drugs that have potential efficacy in patients with an unmet medical need, as demonstrated by some clinical evidence, including published case studies or clinical experience, such that the patient’s survival and/or quality of life might improve, 
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | to identify drug products that have been developed or approved for other indications but can be repurposed to treat those patients who have an unmet medical need, and 
(iii) | to identify drugs that can be quickly developed within 2-4 years to completion of a pivotal study for the submission of a new drug application (“NDA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or to license the drug to a potential strategic partner just prior to a more expensive and time-consuming pivotal study. 

 
While time to develop a drug from finding/designing a molecule (i.e., the discovery stage) to FDA approval typically takes between 10-15 years, our business model is to identify drugs that are in the clinical stage of drug development where (i) a pivotal study can be completed in 2 to 4 years or (ii) enough clinical data can be obtained to demonstrate the value of the asset to a future licensing partner. The FDA approval of the drug would then occur after the preparation of the NDA documents and the FDA review process.
 
In order to add significant value to in-licensed drugs within 2 to 4 years, the drugs must be in the clinical development stage or minimally in the Pre-Investigation New Drug (“IND”) toxicology stage of development. During these 2 to 4 years, we must be able to obtain clinical data to support the use of the drug for the desired indication in order to increase the value of the drug. The additional clinical data could range from clinical proof-of-concept data to demonstrate that the proposed pharmacology occurs clinically in the targeted patient population to pivotal well-designed randomized controlled trial(s).
 
To be able to complete the clinical studies within 2 to 4 years, these drugs must (i) already have clinical proof-of-concept data demonstrating the desired pharmacological activity in humans or, minimally, clinical evidence in the form of case studies or clinical experience demonstrating the drug or a similar drug pharmacologically can successfully treat patients with the targeted indication, (ii) target indications for which the FDA suggests that a single positive pivotal study might be able to demonstrate efficacy, provide enough evidence that the clinical benefits of the drug and of approval outweigh the risks associated with the drug or the present standard of care (e.g., many serious life-threatening conditions, some serious quality of life conditions), and/or (iii) target indications where the prevalence of the condition and the likelihood of patients enrolling in a study meet the desired time-frame to demonstrate at some level that the drug can treat or potentially can treat patients with the condition.
 
Our Drug in Clinical Development
 
Processa’s lead product, PCS-499, is an oral tablet that is a deuterated analog (i.e., a compound having a structure similar to that of the original molecule but differing from it in respect to deuterium replaces hydrogen at certain positions in the molecule) of an active metabolite of an already approved drug called pentoxifylline (PTX). PTX (Trental®) was approved by the FDA on August 30, 1984 for the treatment of patients with intermittent claudication on the basis of chronic occlusive arterial disease of the limbs. In the body, PCS-499 is broken down into multiple metabolites some of which are exactly the same as PTX metabolites and others that differ by deuterium replacing hydrogen at specific sites on the molecule. In addition, PCS-499 is reversibly metabolized to a deuterated form of PTX. PCS-499 and its metabolites have the same basic pharmacological properties as PTX and its metabolites regardless of the molecule having deuterium or hydrogen in animal and healthy human volunteer studies, the systemic exposure to PCS-499 and certain key active metabolites after PCS-499 administration is two times greater than the exposure to the non-deuterated equivalents after the same dose of PTX. Despite the greater exposure to these pharmacologically active molecules, a dose of PCS-499 50% greater than the highest administered safely tolerated PTX dose is well tolerated in animal toxicology and human volunteer safety studies.

Based on our findings in the literature that PTX has some activity in a number of conditions, PCS-499 may potentially provide clinical benefit over other on-label or off-label products used for the various conditions. These conditions include Necrobiosis Lipoidica (NL). NL is a chronic, disfiguring condition for which most patients do not have any treatment options. It develops more commonly in women than in men on the lower extremities, and ulceration can occur in approximately 30% of NL patients, which may lead to more severe complications, such as deep tissue infections and osteonecrosis that can threaten life of the limb. Other conditions such as radiation induced fibrosis (RIF), Type 1 diabetes, venous leg ulcers, psychopathological symptoms in patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency, acute pancreatitis, and numerous other conditions have been treated with PTX with some efficacy reported in case studies or small clinical studies.
 
For example, just as in NL, the dose limiting toxicity of PTX appears to prevent more widespread use in patients with RIF. RIF is a condition that occurs after radiation exposure causes multiple pathophysiological changes in the head and neck area. RIF can significantly affect the quality of life of these patients causing symptoms such as dry mouth, oral mucositis, muscular atrophy, swallowing dysfunction, vascular damage, and neural damage. A drug that attacks the multiple pathophysiological changes in RIF may increase the probability of positively treating patients with this condition. The complex mechanism of action of PCS-499 (e.g., enhanced inhibition of cytokines such as TNF-α, and IFN-γ that induce inflammation and granuloma formation, effect on red blood cell deformability and promotion of platelet deaggregation resulting in an improvement of microcirculatory flow) and the ability to administer a greater yet safer dose than PTX could provide a much-needed treatment for these patients.
 
Our team had a successful Pre-IND meeting with the FDA on NL in October 2017, defining the next steps to move PCS-499 into Phase 2 studies and the path to eventual approval. We have also entered into an agreement with Integrium, LLC (“Integrium”), a contract research organization (CRO), to conduct our Phase 2a clinical study to further evaluate PCS-499 for the treatment of NL. Integrium is a full-service Clinical Proof of Concept firm based in Tustin, California, that specializes in a wide range of therapeutic areas including cardiovascular, metabolic disease and dermatology research. The budget agreed to with Integrium for the completion of the Phase 2 Clinical study is approximately $1.6 to $1.8 million, which PoC Capital has committed to funding up to $1.8 million.
 
The FDA has cleared the IND for PCS-499 in NL such that we are able to move directly into a Phase 2 trial based on the pre-clinical and clinical trials when the compound was developed by CoNCERT Pharmaceuticals for a different indication (i.e. diabetic nephropathy) and a Processa Phase 1 single dose - multiple dose study. When we licensed PCS-499 from CoNCERT in March 2018, all the previous preclinical, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical data was also acquired. Based on the development program and pre-IND meeting with FDA, Processa was able to show sufficient pharmacological, toxicological, pharmacokinetic and safety data to support the Phase 2 program in NL without having to repeat pre-clinical and Phase 1 work that had been previously conducted and submitted for the PCS-499 by CoNCERT. Pharmacologically, PCS-499 is believed to have a complex mechanism of action including anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, hemorheological and antifibrotic effects. PCS-499 may benefit NL patients based on its enhanced inhibition of cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ) that induce inflammation and granuloma formation as well as its effect on red blood cell deformability and promotion of platelet deaggregation, which can improve microcirculatory flow. From a safety perspective, six clinical trials with PCS-499 including four studies in healthy volunteers and two studies in patients with chronic kidney disease have been completed. Since PCS-499 is an analog (i.e., a compound having a structure similar to that of the approved drug, but differing from it in respect to a certain component of the molecule which may cause it to have similar or different effects on the body) of an active metabolite of an already approved drug called pentoxifylline (PTX), we were able to define a development and regulatory strategy for PCS-499 based on the previous PCS-499 data and our findings in the literature that PTX has some pharmacological effects and clinical evidence that could be relevant to the treatment of NL.
 
The development program to date has included five Phase 1 studies, which were conducted to support the clinical pharmacology program for PCS-499, and one Phase 2 study in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with Type 2 diabetes. Of the five Phase 1 studies, four were conducted by CoNCERT (CP505.1001, CP.505.1002, CP505.1003 and CP505.1004) and one by Processa (PCS499.1005). Four of the Phase 1 studies were conducted in healthy volunteers and one Phase 1 study was performed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Each of the Phase 1 studies was conducted to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of PCS-499 oral tablets. No serious adverse events related to PCS-499 have been experienced during the conduct of these studies.

The initial Phase 1 clinical trial (CP505.1002) evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics in 16 healthy volunteers after administration of single doses of 400 mg of three different tablet formulations of PCS-499 (slow, medium, fast release), with comparison to Trental® (pentoxifylline) 400 mg extended-release tablets. A formulation was chosen from this study and was used in subsequent studies. The second Phase 1 trial (CP505.1001) assessed the safety and pharmacokinetics in 6 healthy volunteers after single ascending doses from 600 mg to 2400 mg of the modified release formulation tablets of PCS-499 as well as a single dose of PCS-499 immediate-release (IR) capsules. Doses of PCS-499 up to 1800 mg were well tolerated. The third study (CP505.1003) was designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of 4 weeks of treatment with PCS-499 compared to placebo in non-dialysis patients associated with moderate CKD. Doses of PCS-499 administered in this study started with 600 mg once daily for 2 weeks, followed by 600 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. Four weeks of treatment with PCS-499 was found to be safe and well tolerated in the patients with moderate CKD in this study. The fourth study (CP505.1004) was designed to assess the effect of food on the bioavailability of single 600 mg doses of PCS-499 in 14 healthy volunteers. Based on the results of this study, the product appears to be better tolerated when administered with food. A fifth study (PCS499.1005) conducted by Processa, was a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and optional multiple dosing regimens of modified release formulations of PCS-499 compared to Trental® (pentoxifylline) administered to healthy subjects under fed conditions. Part 1 was a single-dose administration of three modified release formulations of PCS-499 and Trental® to 12 healthy volunteers. Part 2 of the study was an open-label, 3-period crossover comparison in 6 healthy volunteers administration of two different dosage regimens of PCS-499 (900 mg twice daily or 600 mg three times a day) and Trental® after multiple dosing over 4 days. Administration of PCS-499 produced higher concentrations/exposures of the parent and primary metabolite (PCS-499 and D-PTX) on a per mg basis as compared to the concentrations/exposures of the parent and primary metabolite (PTX and PTX-M1) following PTX administration with no increase in frequency or severity of adverse events. From this study, a new modified release formulation was chosen based on the pharmacokinetics results and both dosage regimens of PCS-499 were shown to be well tolerated.
 
In addition to the Phase 1 studies, CoNCERT had previously conducted a Phase 2 study (CP505.2001) which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with PCS-499 600 mg tablets orally, twice daily, in CKD patients with Type 2 diabetes receiving concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and/or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy. This study included a 48-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled period to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 600 mg PCS-499 twice daily in which 177 patients were enrolled. Of the patients that completed the double-blind period of the study, 102 patients chose to enroll in a 48-week open-label period (in which all patients received PCS-499). The primary endpoint of this Phase 2 study was the change after 24 weeks in urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), a marker of kidney tissue damage. The UACR outcomes at 24 weeks of treatment resulted in no significant differences between the PCS-499 and placebo groups. However, at 48 weeks, UACR in patients receiving PCS-499 increased 24 mg/g from baseline compared to 223 mg/g increase in patients receiving placebo (p = 0.097). While not statistically significant, the longer-term treatment duration suggests a favorable trend in UACR for patients receiving PCS-499 as compared to placebo.
 
At 48 weeks, a measurable impact on serum creatinine, a key secondary endpoint, was also observed. The mean serum creatinine level in patients receiving PCS-499 increased by 0.13 mg/dL compared to an increase of 0.21 mg/dL in patients receiving placebo through the 48 weeks of treatment (p = 0.057), reflecting 38% lower levels in the PCS-499 treatment group. Furthermore, 10.3% of patients receiving placebo experienced a 50% or greater increase in serum creatinine levels after 48 weeks compared with 1.5% of patients receiving PCS-499 (p = 0.026). In this Phase 2 study, the overall incidence of serious adverse events was consistent with what might be expected, given the target population studied and the underlying medical histories and characteristics of the patients. Of the patients enrolled in the double-blind phase of the study, a total of 33 patients experienced at least one serious adverse event (SAE) with no meaningful differences between treatment groups (18 (20.2%) of the PCS-499 patients and 15 (17.0%) of the placebo patients). Cardiac disorders were the most frequently reported SAEs, with 4 (4.5%) PCS-499 and 7 (8.0%) placebo patients experiencing at least one event in this system organ class. Infections and infestations (6 (6.7%) PCS-499 patients and 4 (4.5%) placebo patients) and vascular disorders (4 (4.5%) PCS-499 patients and 6 (6.8%) placebo patients) were the system organ classes with the next highest incidence of SAEs. Twelve (11.8%) of the 102 patients that entered the open-label treatment phase experienced at least one SAE during the open-label treatment phase, of which, infections and infestations (5 (4.9%) patients), cardiac disorders (3 (2.9%) patients), and renal and urinary disorders (3 (2.9%) patients), were the most frequently reported SAEs by the system organ class. All SAEs that occurred during the study (in both the double-blind and open-label periods) were judged to be not related to PCS-499. The most common adverse events associated with PCS-499 were gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.

On June 22, 2018, the FDA granted orphan-drug designation to our leading clinical compound PCS-499 for treatment of NL. On September 28, 2018, the FDA cleared our IND for PCS-499 in NL to permit our Phase 2 study. Our first patient in this dose tolerance Phase 2a study received the first dose of PCS-499 on January 29, 2019. As of March 15, 2019, four additional patients have been enrolled in the study and have received at least one dose of PCS-499. All these patients have tolerated PCS-499 to date and are continuing in the study. Our trial is taking place at two sites: The University of Pennsylvania and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). Our hope is that all 12 patients planned for this study will be enrolled by June 2019.
 
In April 2018, we had an FDA Pre-IND meeting to better define the potential development program for PCS-499 in the treatment of RIF in head and neck cancer. With the FDA, we defined a development program, but have decided not to immediately pursue this indication until other potentially acquired drugs and PCS-499 indications could be evaluated. Our goal is to diversify the Processa portfolio by adding a second indication for PCS-499 and/or acquire additional drugs.
 
Our ability to generate meaningful revenue from any products in the United States depends on obtaining FDA authorization. Even if our products are authorized and approved by the FDA, we must still meet the challenges of successful marketing, distribution and consumer acceptance.
 
To advance its mission, Processa has assembled an experienced and talented management and product development team. The Processa team is experienced in developing drug products through all principal regulatory tiers from IND enabling studies to NDA submission. Our team’s combined scientific, development and regulatory experience has resulted in more than 30 drug approvals by the FDA, over 100 meetings with FDA and involvement with more than 50 drug development programs, including drug products targeted to patients who have an unmet medical need. Although we believe that the skills and experience of our team in drug development and commercialization is an important indicator of our future success, the past successes of our team do not guarantee successful development and commercialization of our drugs. In addition, while our executive officers and directors previously served in companies that experienced substantial revenue growth, the growth was due to many factors. There is no guarantee that they will successfully operate or manage us or that we will experience similar growth in revenues, even if they continue to serve as executive officers and/or directors.
 
Current treatments for NL
 
The Necrobiosis Lipoidica condition is an idiopathic disease of the dermis, characterized by collagen degeneration, granuloma formation, fat deposition, and endothelial wall thickening. It is a chronic, disfiguring skin condition that develops on the pretibial region of the lower extremities but can also occur on other areas including the face, scalp, forearm, and trunk. NL usually presents initially as red papules that enlarge to form patches or plaques with an atrophic yellow center and is more common in women than in men.
 
Although more commonly found in diabetic patients, non-diabetic patients can also develop NL and the progression of the disease is not correlated with glycemic control. The disease is encountered in 0.3% - 1.2 % of the diabetic patients which represent 11% - 65% of the overall NL patient population. An association between underlying autoimmunity and the development of NL has been suggested based on the higher-than-expected prevalence of the disease in patients with Type 1 diabetes (as compared to Type 2 diabetes), as well as cases in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Graves’s disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, inflammatory bowel disease, and sarcoidosis. Ulceration occurs in approximately 30% of NL patients, which can lead to more severe complications, such as deep tissue infections and osteonecrosis that can threaten life of the limb. Rare cases of squamous cell carcinoma in the NL region have also been reported.

Although the pathogenesis of NL remains unclear, various potential mechanisms for development and progression of NL have been proposed. Firstly, the formation of granulomas possibly from impaired neutrophil migration, and antibody-mediated vasculitis, as well as the higher incidence of NL in several chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases suggest that inflammation and autoimmunity may be a significant contributor to this disease. Secondly, tissue hypoxia has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of NL based on the presence of angiopathy characterized by glycoprotein (particularly in diabetic patients) and immune complex deposition in blood vessels and lowered O2 tensions within NL lesions. Thirdly, enhanced platelet aggregation and coagulation has been speculated. Lastly, collagen abnormalities including fibrosis and increased collagen crosslinking in the basement membrane have also been hypothesized. Although these hypotheses have been postulated for decades, they have not yet been examined in a relevant disease model due to unavailability of such models.
 
No approved therapies exist for NL and current treatment approaches are based on empirical evidence. Potent topical steroids are often prescribed as first-line therapy, but use can lead to skin atrophy and scarring. Although intralesional steroids are also utilized, concern exists regarding the trauma of injection leading to exacerbation of existing wounds or new ulcerations. Other treatment regimens, including systemic corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, anti-platelet agents, various immunosuppressants (chloroquine, thalidomide, TNF-alpha blockers, etc.), UV phototherapy, and skin grafting have been reported, but results have been inconsistent. For ulcerated lesions, proper wound care involving moisture control, infection control, conservative debridement, and compression therapy is also employed. Nonetheless, NL remains difficult to treat, especially in patients with ulcerations, and spontaneous resolution has been reported in only 13-19% of NL patients after 6-12 years.
 
Multiple clinical case reports have been published demonstrating the benefit of PTX in NL patients with and without ulceration, although PTX dose limiting side effects limits its use. In Phase 1 clinical studies, administration of PCS-499 produced higher concentrations/exposures of the parent and primary metabolite (PCS-499 and D-PTX) on a per mg basis as compared to the concentrations/exposures of the parent and primary metabolite (PTX and PTX-M1) following PTX administration with no increase in adverse events. Both the parents (PCS-499 and PTX) and primary metabolites (D-PTX and PTX-M1) similarly inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF-α, IFN-γ), as well as increase red blood cell flexibility and platelet deaggregation. Furthermore, concentrations of M5, which is associated with the hemorheological activity of PTX, was only slightly lower following PCS-499 administration than after PTX administration. Based on the pharmacological activity of PCS-499 and its metabolite profile, enhanced activity versus PTX may be seen with PCS-499 in NL. Thus, PCS-499 may benefit NL patients based on its enhanced inhibition of cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ) that induce inflammation and granuloma formation, as well as its effect on red blood cell deformability and promotion of platelet deaggregation, which can improve microcirculatory flow.
 
Research and Development, Product Manufacturing, and Clinical Supplies
 
We currently have no in-house laboratory, drug manufacturing, product manufacturing, or clinical facilities. We rely on third-party contract labs, animal facilities, clinical facilities, and drug manufacturers to make the material used to support the development of our product candidates and to execute the actual studies. However, the study designs and the final evaluation/interpretation of the data are made by us with the third-party contractors providing the hands-on services to perform the studies. We purchase materials used in our clinical trial activities from various companies and suppliers.
Customers and Distribution
 
As we are still in the process of developing our products, we do not currently sell or distribute pharmaceutical products.

Intellectual Property
 
Our success will depend in large part on our ability to:
 

● | obtain and maintain international and domestic patent and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | prosecute and defend our patents, once obtained; 
● | preserve our trade secrets; and 
● | operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties. 

 
Although we rely extensively on licensing patents from third parties, we intend to seek appropriate patent protection for product candidates in our research and development programs where applicable and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected countries. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for composition of matter, medical uses, processes for preparation and formulations.
 
Our current patent portfolio consists of patents licensed from CoNCERT Pharmaceuticals for PCS-499 and related compounds. The portfolio includes approximately 26 issued patents (of which 8 are in the United States), that are directed to claims for composition of matter, methods of use and certain chemical processes. Of these, 3 issued patents in the U.S., as well as 2 in each of Europe, Australia, Canada, China, Japan and Mexico and 1 in each of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Russia, South Korea, the Philippines and South Africa cover the composition of matter of PCS-499. There are also approximately 4 pending patent applications for PCS-499 and related compounds directed to claims for composition of matter and methods of use, including 2 in the United States and 1 in each of Europe and Brazil. The issued U.S. and European patents are expected to expire in 2029 and 2030, excluding any extension or adjustment of patent term that may be available.
 
We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. We seek protection of these trade secrets, proprietary know-how and any continuing innovation, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for, or adequate remedies to protect, our technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors.
 
License Agreement with CoNCERT Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
On October 4, 2017, Promet entered into the CoNCERT Agreement with CoNCERT. On March 19, 2018, we, Promet, and CoNCERT entered into an Amended Option Licensing Agreement (“March Amendment”) that, among other things, assigned the CoNCERT Agreement from Promet to us and we exercised the exclusive commercial license option for the PCS-499 compound from CoNCERT.
 
The CoNCERT Agreement provides us with an exclusive (including to CoNCERT) royalty-bearing license to CoNCERT’s patent rights and know-how to develop, manufacture, use, sub-license and commercialize compounds (PCS-499 and each metabolite thereof) and pharmaceutical products with such compounds worldwide. We are required to pay CoNCERT royalties, on a product by product basis, on worldwide net sales, as follows:
 

● | 4% of the net sales of the portion less than or equal to $100 million; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 5% of the net sales of the portion greater than $100 million and less than or equal to $500 million; 
● | 6% of the net sales of the portion greater than $500 million and less than or equal to $1.0 billion; and 
● | 10% of the net sales of the portion greater than $1 billion if such sales are made by us or our affiliates, or with respect to sales by our sublicensees, the greater of (i) 6% or (ii) 50% of all payment received by us with respect to such sublicencee.

-


We will incur royalty obligations to CoNCERT on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis that expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of (i) expiration or invalidation of the last patent rights covering such product in such country or (ii) the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale to a non-sublicensee third party of such product in such country. The March Amendment provides that if we sublicense any of the intellectual property licensed to us by CoNCERT to a third party prior to the earliest date that (a) we raise gross proceeds of at least $8.0 million in one or more equity offerings and (b) CoNCERT can sell the shares of common stock released to it by Promet upon execution of the March Amendment without restriction under Rule 144(b)(1), then we must pay CoNCERT 15% of such revenue.
 
We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at our sole cost and expense, to develop and obtain regulatory approval for one product in the U.S. and at least one other major market and, subject to obtaining regulatory approval in the applicable major market, commercialize one product in the U.S. and at least one other major market. CoNCERT may terminate the agreement if, following written notice and a 60-day opportunity to demonstrate a plan to cure, it believes that we are not using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for one product in the U.S. and in at least one other major market for any consecutive nine-month period.
 
The term of the CoNCERT Agreement continues in full force and effect until the expiration of the last royalty term. On a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, upon the expiration of the royalty term in such country with respect to such product, we shall have a fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable license to such intellectual property with respect to such product in such country. In the event of a material breach of the CoNCERT Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement provided such breach is not cured in the 90 days following written notice of the breach (which period is shortened to 15 days for a payment breach). In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the filing of an insolvency proceeding by or against the other party that is not dismissed within 90 days of such filing.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We do not currently have sales or marketing capabilities. In order to commercially market any pharmaceutical product that we successfully advance through preclinical and clinical development and for which we obtain regulatory approval, we must either develop a sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third parties with sales and marketing capabilities. Because of the early stage of our pharmaceutical development programs, we have not yet developed a sales and marketing strategy for any pharmaceutical products that we may successfully develop.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive. Our potential competitors in the field are many in number and include major pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology companies. Many of our potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical and other resources than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, they may have substantially more experience in effecting strategic combinations, in-licensing technology, developing drugs, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products. We cannot give any assurances that we can compete effectively with these other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our potential competitors in these markets may succeed in developing products that could render our products and those of our collaborators obsolete or non-competitive. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in the fields in which we compete.
Government Regulation
 
Pharmaceutical Regulation
 
If we market any pharmaceutical products in the United States, they will be subject to extensive government regulation. Likewise, if we seek to market and distribute any such products abroad, they would also be subject to extensive foreign government regulation.

--


In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products. FDA regulations govern the testing, manufacturing, advertising, promotion, labeling, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and generally require a rigorous process for the approval of new drugs.
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state generally must decide whether to recognize approval.
 
The definition of “rare or orphan disease” differs between the US and other foreign countries, and as such may impact the development program, the regulatory approval process, the exclusivity marketing periods, sales and marketing and the pricing. Since many of the products being developed will be used in rare diseases, the differences in the regulations between the US and other foreign countries may add complexity to the development program, the clinical studies, regulatory approval and costing for the product.
 
Regulation in the United States
 
The FDA testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and money. We cannot assure you that any of our products will ever obtain approval. The FDA approval process for new drugs includes, without limitation:
 

(i) | Preclinical studies; 
------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | Submission of an Investigational New Drug Application or IND, for clinical trials; 
(iii) | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy of the product; 
(iv) | Review of a New Drug Application, or NDA; and 
(v) | Inspection of facilities used in the manufacturing of the drug to access compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations. 

 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and effectiveness of the product. Most of these studies must be performed according to good laboratory practices, a system of management controls for laboratories and research organizations to ensure the consistency and reliability of results. The results of the preclinical studies, existing clinical and/or human use data (if applicable) together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which we are required to file before we can commence any clinical trials for our product candidates in the United States. Clinical trials may begin 30 days after an IND is received, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials. If concerns or questions are raised, an IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot assure you that submission of any additional IND for any of our preclinical product candidates will result in authorization to commence clinical trials.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate that is the subject of the trial to volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution at which the study will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution arising from the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. Also, clinical trials must be performed according to good clinical practices, which are enumerated in FDA regulations and guidance documents.

Clinical trials typically are conducted in sequential phases: Phases 1, 2 and 3. The phases may overlap. The FDA may require that we suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including if the FDA makes a finding that the subjects participating in the trial are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
In Phase 1 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on healthy human volunteers to determine safety, any adverse effects, proper dosage, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and other drug effects.
 
In Phase 2 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a limited number of subjects to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
 
In Phase 3 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a larger number of subjects in an expanded patient population and at multiple clinical sites.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our current or future clinical trials will result in approval to market our products.
 
An NDA must include comprehensive and complete descriptions of the preclinical testing, clinical trials and the chemical, manufacturing and control requirements of a drug that enable the FDA to determine the drug’s safety and efficacy. An NDA must be submitted, filed and approved by the FDA before any product that we may successfully develop can be marketed commercially in the United States.
 
The facilities, procedures and operations for any of our contract manufacturers must be determined to be adequate by the FDA before product approval. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP, licensing specifications and other FDA regulations before and after an NDA has been approved. Foreign manufacturing facilities are also subject to periodic FDA inspections or inspections by foreign regulatory authorities. Among other things, the FDA may withhold approval of NDAs or other product applications if deficiencies are found at the facility. Vendors that may supply us with finished products or components used to manufacture, package and label products are also subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections.
 
In addition, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulatory requirements on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, including, but not limited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet.
 
Failure to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA’s review of NDAs, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
Since we plan to market our products in foreign countries, we may also be subject to a wide variety of foreign regulations governing the development, manufacture and marketing of our products. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must still be obtained prior to marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies, and the time needed to secure approval in any region such as the European Union or in a country with an independent review procedure may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. We cannot assure you that clinical trials conducted in one country will be accepted by other countries or that an approval in one country or region will result in approval elsewhere.
Additional Regulations
 
Third-Party Reimbursement
 
In the United States, physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers that purchase pharmaceutical products generally rely on third-party payors, principally private health insurance plans, Medicare and, to a lesser extent, Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the product and procedure for which the product is being used. Even if a product is approved for marketing by the FDA, there is no assurance that third-party payors will cover the cost of the product and related medical procedures. If they do not, end-users of the drug would not be eligible for any reimbursement of the cost, and our ability to successfully market any such drug would be materially and adversely impacted.

12
--


Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region. Reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many foreign markets, including markets in which we hope to sell our products, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government pricing control. In these markets, once marketing approval is received, pricing negotiations could take significant additional time. As in the United States, the lack of satisfactory reimbursement or inadequate government pricing of any of our products would limit their widespread use and lower potential product revenues.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Federal and state anti-kickback and anti-fraud and abuse laws, as well as the federal Civil False Claims Act may apply to certain drug and device research and marketing practices. The Civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States. Actions under the Civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or by a private individual acting as an informer or whistleblower in the name of the government. Violations of the Civil False Claims Act can result in significant monetary penalties. The federal government is using the Civil False Claims Act, and the threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers, suppliers and drug and device manufacturers throughout the country for a wide variety of drug and device marketing and research practices and has obtained multi-million-dollar settlements. The federal government may continue to devote substantial resources toward investigating healthcare providers’, suppliers’ and drug and device manufacturers’ compliance with the Civil False Claims Act and other fraud and abuse laws. We may have to expend significant financial resources and management attention if we ever become the focus of such an investigation, even if we are not guilty of any wrong doings.
HIPAA
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, requires the use of standard transactions, privacy and security standards and other administrative simplification provisions, by covered entities which include many healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA instructs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations implementing these standards in the United States.
Other Laws
 
We are also subject to other federal, state and local laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, and various federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of material into the environment.
Employees
 
As of March 15, 2019, we had 15 employees. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor or trade union, and we believe that our relations with our employees is good. We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced personnel, but competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the individuals needed.
Status as an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as that term is defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (i.e., those that have not had a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act, or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with such new or revised financial accounting standards. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We may still take advantage of all of the other provisions of the JOBS Act, which include, but are not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

Tax-Free Combination with Heatwurx
 
On October 2, 2017, Heatwurx, Inc. (“Heatwurx”) entered into a tax-free transaction pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement with Promet Therapeutics, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Promet”) pursuant to which, on October 4, 2017, Heatwurx acquired all the net assets of Promet, including the rights to the CoNCERT Agreement in exchange for issuing Promet (and CoNCERT) 31,745,242 shares of its common stock. Immediately following the transaction, Promet owned approximately 84% of our common stock and, as part of the Section 351 transaction, held approximately 6% of our common stock for the benefit of CoNCERT, until the CoNCERT transaction had been concluded whereupon CoNCERT took title to their shares. Following the closing, we changed our name from “Heatwurx Inc.” to “Processa Pharmaceuticals Inc.” and abandoned Heatwurx’s prior business plan. We are now pursuing Promet’s historical and proposed business.
 
We accounted for the net asset acquisition transaction as a reverse acquisition in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805-40-45, Business Combinations – Reverse Acquisitions, where Promet was considered the accounting acquirer, and as a tax-free contribution for tax purposes under Internal Revenue Code Section 351. Accordingly, Promet’s historical results of operations replaced our historical results of operations for all periods prior to the Merger. Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis to prior year periods are to the results of Promet for such period on a stand-alone basis. Prior to the acquisition, we had nominal net liabilities and operations. It was considered a non-operating public shell corporation.
 
In December 2017, we effected a one-for-seven reverse split of our shares of common stock. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes give retroactive effect to this one-for-seven reverse stock split.
 
Business Segments
 
We manage our business as one segment which includes all activities related to the discovery, development, and commercialization of drug products for the treatment of serious medical conditions. For financial information related to our one segment, see our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.
