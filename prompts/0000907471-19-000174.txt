Item 1.     Business
GENERAL

Meta, a registered unitary savings and loan holding company, was incorporated in Delaware on June 14, 1993, the principal assets of which are all the issued and outstanding shares of the Bank, a federal savings bank, the accounts of which are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") as administrator of the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”).  Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to the Company include Meta and the Bank, and all subsidiaries of Meta, direct or indirect, on a consolidated basis.
The Bank, a wholly-owned full-service banking subsidiary of Meta, operates through three reportable segments (Payments, Banking, and Corporate Services/Other). The diagram below reflects the Company's divisions and how they fall within the Company's segment structure. The Company works with high-value niche industries, strategic-growth companies and technology adopters to grow their businesses and build more profitable customer relationships. The Company tailors solutions for bank and non-bank businesses, and provides a focused collaborative approach.
The business of the Bank consists of attracting deposits and investing those funds in its National Lending and Community Banking loan and lease portfolios. On August 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Crestmark Bancorp, Inc. ("Crestmark") and its Michigan state-charted bank subsidiary, Crestmark Bank (the "Crestmark Acquisition"). Through the Crestmark Acquisition, the Company expanded its business-to-business commercial financing business. In addition to originating loans and leases, the Bank also occasionally contracts to sell loans, such as tax refund advance loans, consumer credit product loans, and government guaranteed loans, to third party buyers. The Bank also sells and purchases loan participations from time to time to and from other financial institutions, as well as mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") and other investments permissible under applicable regulations. 
In addition to its lending and deposit gathering activities, the Bank’s divisions issue prepaid cards, design innovative consumer credit products, sponsor automated teller machines (“ATMs”) into various debit networks, and offer tax refund-transfer services and other payment industry products and services.  Through its activities, the Meta Payment Systems (“MPS”) division generates both fee income and low-cost deposits for the Bank. 
First Midwest Financial Capital Trust I, also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was established in July 2001 for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities.
In April 2017, the Company formed a new entity, Meta Capital, LLC ("Meta Capital"), that is a wholly-owned service corporation subsidiary of MetaBank. Meta Capital was formed for the purpose of making minority equity investments. Meta Capital focuses on investing in companies in the financial services industry. 
The Company is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. See “Regulation and Supervision” herein.

The principal executive office of the Company is located at 5501 South Broadband Lane, Sioux Falls, South Dakota 57108.  Its telephone number at that address is (605) 782-1767.

MARKET AREAS

The Payments segment, which provides payments products and services nationwide, primarily operates out of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, with additional offices in Louisville, Kentucky, Easton, Pennsylvania and Hurst, Texas. Within the Company's Banking segment, the AFS/IBEX division operates out of its headquarters in Dallas, Texas with other offices throughout the country. Crestmark operates out of its headquarters in Troy, Michigan, with other offices throughout the country. The community bank’s locations and primary market areas include nine branch offices in Storm Lake, Iowa, Brookings, South Dakota, Sioux Falls, South Dakota and the Des Moines, Iowa area.

See "Community Banking-Sale of Community Bank Division."
LENDING ACTIVITIES

General
The diagram below shows the composition of the Company's lending portfolio by loan type. The Company emphasizes credit quality and seeks to avoid undue concentrations of loans and leases to a single industry or based on a single class of collateral. The Company has established lending policies that include a number of underwriting factors that it considers in making a loan, including loan-to-value ratio, cash flow, interest rate and credit history of the borrower.
The Company focuses its lending activities on the origination of commercial finance loans, consumer finance loans and taxpayer advance loans. The Company also continues to originate traditional one-to-four family mortgage loans, commercial operating loans, multi-family real estate loans, consumer loans and agricultural-related loans. At September 30, 2019, the Company’s loans and leases receivable, net of allowance for loan and lease losses, totaled $3.63 billion, or 59% of the Company’s total assets, as compared to $2.93 billion, or 50%, at September 30, 2018. 
Loan and lease applications are initially considered and approved at various levels of authority, depending on the type and amount of the loan or lease as directed by the Bank's lending policies.  The Company has a loan committee structure in place for oversight of its lending activities.  Loans and leases in excess of certain amounts require approval by either an Executive Credit Committee or a Board Credit Committee. The Company may discontinue, adjust, or create new lending programs to respond to competitive factors.  

At September 30, 2019, the Company’s largest lending relationship to a single borrower or group of related borrowers totaled $88.9 million.  The Company had 24 other lending relationships in excess of $14.5 million as of September 30, 2019.  

Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition
The following table provides information about the composition of the Company’s loan and lease portfolio in dollar amounts and in percentages as of the dates indicated.  In general, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the aggregate principal amounts in all categories of loans and leases discussed below, except agricultural loans, increased over levels from the prior fiscal year. 
Loan and lease tables have been conformed to be consistent with the Company's updated categorization of its lending portfolio between National Lending and Community Banking.

National Lending
Commercial Finance
The Company's commercial finance product lines include asset-based lending, factoring, leasing, insurance premium finance, and other commercial finance products offered on a nationwide basis. 
Asset-Based Lending. Through its Crestmark division, the Bank provides asset-based loans secured by borrowers' short-term assets such as inventory, accounts receivable, and work-in-process. Asset-based loans may also be secured by real estate and equipment. The primary sources of repayment are the operating income of the borrower, the collection of the receivables securing the loan, and/or the sale of the inventory securing the loan. Loans are typically revolving lines of credit with terms of one to three years, whereby the Bank withholds a contingency reserve representing the difference between the amount advanced and the fair value of the invoice amount or other collateral value. Credit risk is managed through advance rates appropriate for the collateral, standardized loan policies, established and authorized credit limits, attentive portfolio management and the use of lock box agreements and similar arrangements which result in the Company receiving and controlling the debtors' cash receipts. The Bank also originates collateralized term loans and notes receivable, with terms ranging from three to 25 years.
Factoring. Through its Crestmark division, the Bank provides factoring lending where clients provide detailed inventory, accounts receivable, and work-in-process reports for lending arrangements. The factoring clients are diversified as to industry and geography. With these loans, the Crestmark division withholds a contingency reserve, which is the difference between the fair value of the invoice amount or other collateral value and the amount advanced. This reserve is withheld for nonpayment of factored receivables, service fees and other adjustments. Credit risk is managed through standardized advance policies, established and authorized credit limits, verification of receivables, attentive portfolio management and the use of lock box agreements and similar arrangements which result in the Company receiving and controlling the client's cash receipts. In addition, clients generally guarantee the payment of purchased accounts receivable. 
Lease Financing. Through its Crestmark division, the Bank provides creative, flexible lease solutions for technology, capital equipment and select transportation assets like tractors and trailers. Direct financing leases and sales-type leases substantially transfer the benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the lessee.  The lease may contain provisions that transfer ownership to the lessee at the end of the initial term, contain a bargain purchase option or allow for purchase of the equipment at fair market value.  Residual values are estimated at the inception of the lease.  Lease maturities are generally no greater than 84 months. The focus in this lease financing category is to support middle market companies by providing a variety of financing products to help them meet their business objectives.
Insurance Premium Finance. Through its AFS/IBEX division the Bank provides, on a national basis, short-term, primarily collateralized financing to facilitate the commercial customers’ purchase of insurance for various forms of risk, otherwise known as insurance premium financing. This includes, but is not limited to, policies for commercial property, casualty and liability risk.  Premiums are advanced either directly to the insurance carrier or through an intermediary/broker and repaid by the policyholder with interest during the policy term.  The policyholder generally makes a 20% to 25% down payment to the insurance broker and finances the remainder over nine to 10 months on average.  The down payment is set such that if the policy is canceled, the unearned premium is typically sufficient to cover the loan balance and accrued interest. The AFS/IBEX division markets itself to the insurance community as a competitive option based on service, reputation, competitive terms, cost and ease of operation. 
Small Business Administration ("SBA") and United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA"). The Bank originates loans through programs partially guaranteed by the SBA or USDA. These loans are to small businesses and professionals with what the Bank believes are lower risk characteristics. Certain guaranteed portions of these loans are generally sold to the secondary market. See "Originations, Sales and Servicing of Loans and Leases" below for further details.
Other Commercial Finance. Included in this category of loans are the Company's healthcare receivables loan portfolio primarily comprised of loans to individuals for medical services received. The majority of these loans are guaranteed by the hospital providing the service to the debtor and this guarantee serves to reduce credit risk as the guarantors agree to repurchase severely delinquent loans. Credit risk is minimized on these loans based on the guarantor’s repurchase agreement. This loan category also includes commercial real estate loans to customers of the Crestmark division.
Consumer Finance
Consumer Credit Products. The Bank designs its credit program relationships with certain desired outcomes. Three high priority outcomes are liquidity, credit protection, and risk retention.  The Bank believes the benefits of these outcomes not only support its goals but the goals of the credit program partner as well. The Bank designs its program credit protections in a manner so that the Bank earns a reasonable risk adjusted return, but is protected by certain layers of credit support, similar to what you would find in structured finance. The Bank will hold a sizable portion of the originated asset on its own balance sheet, but retains the flexibility to sell a portion of the originated asset to other interested parties, thereby supporting program liquidity.  
Through September 30, 2019, the Bank has launched two consumer credit programs. The loan products offered under these programs are generally closed-end installment loans with terms between 12 months and 84 months and revolving lines of credit with durations between six months and 60 months. As part of the Bank’s ongoing balance sheet management strategy, $111.7 million in held for sale consumer credit product loan balances were sold on October 1, 2019.
Other Consumer Finance. The Bank's purchased student loan portfolios are seasoned, floating rate, private portfolios that are serviced by a third-party servicer. The portfolio purchased during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 is indexed to one-month of the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), while the portfolio purchased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 is indexed to three-month LIBOR plus various margins. The Company received written notification on June 18, 2018 from ReliaMax Surety Company ("ReliaMax"), the company that provided insurance coverage for the student loan portfolios, which informed policy holders that the South Dakota Division of Insurance filed a petition to have ReliaMax declared insolvent and to adopt a plan of liquidation. An Order of Liquidation was entered on June 27, 2018 by the Sixth Circuit Court in Hughes County, South Dakota, declaring ReliaMax insolvent and appointing the South Dakota Division of Insurance as liquidator to adopt a plan of liquidation. The Company expects to ultimately recover a portion of the unearned premiums, though the Company can provide no assurance as to the timing and amount of any such recovery.
Tax Services
The Bank's tax services division provides short-term taxpayer advance loans. Taxpayers are underwritten to determine eligibility for these unsecured loans. Due to the nature of taxpayer advance loans, it typically takes no more than three e-file cycles (the period of time between scheduled IRS payments) from when the return is accepted by the IRS to collect from the borrower. In the event of default, the Bank has no recourse against the tax consumer. The Bank will charge off the balance of a taxpayer advance loan if there is a balance at the end of the calendar year, or when collection of principal becomes doubtful.
Through its tax services division, the Bank provides short-term electronic return originator ("ERO") advance loans on a nationwide basis. These loans are typically utilized by tax preparers to purchase tax preparation software and to prepare tax office operations for the upcoming tax season. EROs go through an underwriting process to determine eligibility for the unsecured advances. ERO loans are not collateralized. Collection on ERO advances begins once the ERO begins to process refund transfers. Generally, the Bank will charge off the balance of an ERO advance loan if there is a balance at the end of June, or when collection of principal becomes doubtful.
Warehouse Finance
The Bank participates in several asset-backed warehouse lines of credit whereby the Bank is in a senior, secured position as the first out participant. These facilities are primarily collateralized by consumer receivables, with the Bank holding a senior collateral position enhanced by a subordinate party structure. 
Community Banking
Commercial Real Estate and Operating 
The Company engages in commercial and multi-family real estate lending in the community bank's primary market areas and surrounding areas. These loans are secured primarily by apartment buildings, office buildings, and hotels.  Commercial and multi-family real estate loans generally are underwritten with terms not exceeding 20 years, have loan-to-value ratios of up to 80% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan, and are typically secured by guarantees of the borrowers.  
The Company originates its community banking commercial operating loans primarily in the community bank's market areas.  Most of these commercial operating loans have been extended to finance local and regional businesses and include short-term loans to finance machinery and equipment purchases, inventory and accounts receivable.  Commercial loans also may involve the extension of revolving credit for a combination of equipment acquisitions and working capital in expanding companies. The maximum term for loans extended on machinery and equipment is based on the projected useful life of such machinery and equipment.  Generally, the maximum term on non-mortgage lines of credit is one year. 
Consumer One-to-Four Family Real Estate and Other
The Company originates one-to-four family residential mortgage loans in the community bank's primary market areas with terms up to a maximum of 30 years and with loan-to-value ratios up to 100% of the lesser of the appraised value of the property securing the loan or the contract price. However, the vast majority of these loans are originated with loan-to-value ratios below 80%. The Company also currently offers five- and ten-year ARM loans.
The Company also originates a variety of secured consumer loans, including home equity, home improvement, automobile and boat loans, as well as loans secured by savings deposits in its primary market areas and surrounding areas. Substantially all of the Company’s home equity loans and lines of credit are secured by second mortgages on principal residences.  The Bank will lend amounts which, together with all prior liens, may be up to 90% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan.  Home equity loans and lines of credit generally have maximum terms of five years.
Agricultural Real Estate and Operating
The Company originates loans to finance the purchase of farmland, livestock, farm machinery and equipment, seed, fertilizer, and other farm-related products, primarily in its market areas. Agricultural operating loans are originated at either an adjustable- or fixed-rate of interest for up to a one-year term or, in the case of livestock, are due upon sale.  Agricultural real estate loans are frequently originated with adjustable rates of interest.  Generally, such loans provide for a fixed rate of interest for the first five to 10 years, after which the loan will balloon or the interest rate will adjust annually.  These loans generally amortize over a period of 20 to 25 years.  Fixed-rate agricultural real estate loans typically have terms up to 10 years.  Agricultural real estate loans are generally limited to 75% of the value of the property securing the loan.
Sale of Community Bank Division
The Company announced on November 20, 2019 that MetaBank entered into an agreement with Central Bank, an Iowa
state-chartered bank headquartered in Storm Lake, Iowa, for the sale of MetaBank’s community bank division. Included
in the sale are all of MetaBank's community bank branches located in Iowa and South Dakota, as well as deposits and fixed assets related thereto, representing approximately $270 million of deposits. Also included in the sale are approximately $265 million of loans. Following the closing of the transaction, MetaBank will retain approximately $935 million in aggregate principal amount of loans associated with MetaBank’s community bank division, which will remain on Meta’s balance sheet at closing and will be serviced by Central following closing. The branches will be owned and operated by Central Bank following the closing of the transaction. The closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions. The transaction is expected to close late in the first calendar quarter of 2020.
ORIGINATIONS, SALES AND SERVICING OF LOANS AND LEASES
The Company, from time to time, sells loans and leases, and in some cases, loan participations, generally without recourse.  At September 30, 2019, there were no outstanding loans sold by the Company with recourse.  When loans or leases are sold, the Company may retain the responsibility for collecting and remitting loan payments, making certain that real estate tax payments are made on behalf of borrowers, and otherwise servicing the loans.  The servicing fee is recognized as income over the life of the loans.  As of September 30, 2019, the Company serviced loans that it originated and sold totaling $175.5 million, of which $129.1 million were SBA/USDA guaranteed loan balances sold to the secondary market, $1.9 million were sold to Fannie Mae, and $44.4 million were sold to others.

The Company generally sells the guaranteed portion of its SBA 7(a) loans and USDA program loans in the secondary market. These sales have resulted in premium income for the Company at the time of sale and created a stream of future servicing income. When the Company sells the guaranteed portion of its loans, it incurs credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the loans, and, if a customer defaults on the loan, the Company shares any loss and recovery related to the loan pro-rata with the SBA or USDA, as applicable. If the SBA or USDA establishes that a loss on a guaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced by the Company, the SBA or USDA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from the Company, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In periods of economic uncertainty, the Company’s ability to originate large dollar volumes of loans and leases may be substantially reduced or restricted, with a resultant decrease in related loan origination fees, other fee income and operating earnings.  In addition, the Company’s ability to sell loans may substantially decrease if potential buyers (principally government agencies) reduce their purchasing activities.
The following table shows the loan and lease originations (including draws, loan and lease renewals, and undisbursed portions of loans and leases in process), purchases, and sales and repayment activities of the Company for the periods indicated.

(1) The tax services loans past due represented the aggregate remaining balance of the tax services loan portfolio.
Delinquencies 90 days and over constituted 0.64% of total loans and leases and 0.40% of total assets. 
Generally, when a loan or lease becomes delinquent 90 days or more or when the collection of principal or interest becomes doubtful, the Company will place the loan or lease on a non-accrual status and, as a result, previously accrued interest income on the loan or lease is reversed against current income. The loan or lease will generally remain on a non-accrual status until six months of good payment history has been established or management believes the financial status of the borrower has been significantly restored. Certain relationships in the table above are over 90 days past due and still accruing. The Company considers these relationships as being in the process of collection. Insurance premium finance loans, consumer finance and tax services loans are generally not placed on non-accrual status, but are instead written off when the collection of principal and interest become doubtful.

(1) Certain tax services loans do not bear interest.
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, gross interest income which would have been recorded had the non-accruing loans and leases been current in accordance with their original terms was insignificant, none of which was included in interest income.

Non-Accruing Loans and Leases
At September 30, 2019, the Company had $14.4 million in non-accruing loans and leases, which constituted less than 0.4% of the Company's gross loan and lease portfolio and total assets. At September 30, 2018, the Company had $2.9 million in non-accruing loans which also constituted less than 0.1% of its gross loans portfolio and total assets.  
The fiscal 2019 increase in non-accruing loans and leases was primarily related to increases in the commercial finance portfolio.

Accruing Loans and Leases Delinquent 90 Days or More
At September 30, 2019, the Company had $12.1 million in accruing loans and leases delinquent 90 days or more, compared to $7.3 million at September 30, 2018. This balance of accruing loans and leases 90 days or more past due was mainly comprised of commercial finance, consumer finance and tax services loans and leases.
Classified Assets
Federal regulations provide for the classification of certain loans, leases, and other assets such as debt and equity securities considered by the Bank's primary regulator, the OCC, to be of lesser quality as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss,” with each such classification dependent on the facts and circumstances surrounding the assets in question. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the Bank will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, “highly questionable and improbable.”  Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such minimal value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.

General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets.  When assets are classified as “loss,” the Bank is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount.  The Bank’s determinations as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances are subject to review by its regulatory authorities, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.

On the basis of management’s review of its classified assets, at September 30, 2019, the Company had classified loans and leases of $40.6 million as substandard, $0.5 million as doubtful and none as loss.  Further, at September 30, 2019, the Company owned real estate or other assets as a result of foreclosure of loans with a value of $29.5 million.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses based on management’s evaluation of incurred losses and the risk inherent in its loan and lease portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of its loan and lease activity, including those loans and leases that are being specifically monitored by management.  Such evaluation, which includes a review of loans and leases for which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, includes consideration of, among other matters, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical loan and lease loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an appropriate loan and lease loss allowance.

Management closely monitors economic developments both regionally and nationwide, and considers these factors when assessing the appropriateness of its allowance for loan and lease losses.  The current economic environment continues to show signs of stability in the Bank’s markets.  The Bank’s average loss rates over the past three years were low relative to industry averages for such years, offset, in the case of fiscal 2016, with a higher agricultural loss rate driven by the charge off of one relationship. The Bank does not believe it is likely these low loss conditions will continue indefinitely.  Each loan and lease segment is evaluated using both historical loss factors as well as other qualitative factors in order to determine the amount of risk the Company believes exists within that segment.
Management believes that, based on a detailed review of the loan and lease portfolio, historic loan and lease losses, current economic conditions, the size of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors, the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses at September 30, 2019 reflected an appropriate allowance against probable losses from the lending portfolio.  Although the Company maintains its allowance for loan and lease losses at a level it considers to be appropriate, investors and others are cautioned that there can be no assurance that future losses will not exceed estimated amounts, or that additional provisions for loan and lease losses will not be required in future periods.  In addition, the Company’s determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses is subject to review by the OCC, which can require the establishment of additional general or specific allowances.
Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure are recorded at fair value.  If fair value at the date of foreclosure is lower than the balance of the related loan, the difference will be charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses at the time of transfer.  Valuations are periodically updated by management and, if the value declines, a specific provision for losses on such property is established by a charge to operations.

The following table sets forth an analysis of the Company’s allowance for loan and lease losses.

Investment Activities

General
The investment policy of the Company generally is to invest funds among various categories of investments and maturities based upon the Company’s need for liquidity, to achieve the proper balance between its desire to minimize risk and maximize yield, to provide collateral for borrowings and to fulfill the Company’s asset/liability management policies.  The Company’s investment and MBS portfolios are managed in accordance with a written investment policy adopted by the Board of Directors, which is implemented by members of the Company’s Asset/Liability Committee.  The Company closely monitors balances in these accounts and maintains a portfolio of highly liquid assets to fund potential deposit outflows or other liquidity needs.  To date, the Company has not experienced any significant outflows related to the MPS division deposits, though no assurance can be given that this will continue to be the case.

As of September 30, 2019, investment securities and MBS with fair values of approximately $812.2 million, $152.7 million, and $4.8 million were pledged as collateral for the Bank’s Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (“FHLB”) advances, Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) advances and collateral for securities sold under agreements to repurchase, respectively.  For additional information regarding the Company’s collateralization of borrowings, see Note 10 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” which is included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Investment Securities  
It is the Company’s general policy to purchase investment securities which are U.S. Government-related securities, U.S. Government-related agency and instrumentality securities, U.S. Government-related agency or instrumentality collateralized securities, state and local government obligations and overnight federal funds.

As of September 30, 2019, the Company had total investment securities, excluding MBS, with an amortized cost of $1.01 billion compared to $1.68 billion as of September 30, 2018.  At September 30, 2019, $693.5, or 68%, of the Company’s investment securities were pledged to secure various obligations of the Company. Many of the Company’s municipal holdings are able to be pledged at both the FRB and the FHLB.

Mortgage-Backed Securities  
The Company’s mortgage-backed and related securities portfolio as of September 30, 2019 consisted entirely of securities issued by U.S. Government agencies or instrumentalities, including those of Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Farmer Mac.  The Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Farmer Mac certificates are modified pass‑through MBS representing undivided interests in underlying pools of fixed‑rate, or certain types of adjustable-rate, predominantly single-family mortgages issued by these U.S. Government agencies or instrumentalities. At September 30, 2019, the Company had a diverse portfolio of MBS with an amortized cost of $385.9 million. The fair market value of the MBS at September 30, 2019 was $389.7 million. 
MBS generally increase the quality of the Company’s assets by virtue of the insurance or guarantees that back them, are more liquid than individual mortgage loans, and may be used to collateralize borrowings or other obligations of the Company.  At September 30, 2019, $323.5 million, or 83.0%, of the Company’s MBS were pledged to secure various obligations of the Company.

While MBS carry a reduced credit risk as compared to whole loans, such securities remain subject to the risk that a fluctuating interest rate environment, along with other factors such as the geographic distribution and other underwriting risks inherent in the underlying mortgage loans, may alter the prepayment rate of such mortgage loans and so affect both the prepayment speed, and value, of such securities.  The prepayment risk associated with MBS is continually monitored, and prepayment rate assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to update the Company’s MBS accounting and asset/liability reports.
The following table sets forth the carrying value of the Company’s MBS at the dates indicated.

At September 30, 2019, the contractual maturity of approximately 96.1% of the Company’s mortgage backed-securities were in excess of ten years. The actual maturity of an MBS is typically less than its stated contractual maturity due to scheduled principal payments and prepayments of the underlying mortgages.  Prepayments that are different than anticipated will affect the yield to maturity.  The yield is based upon the interest income and the amortization of any premium or discount related to the MBS.  In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), premiums and discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans, which decrease and increase interest income, respectively.  The prepayment assumptions used to determine the amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the yield of MBS, and these assumptions are reviewed periodically to reflect actual prepayments.  Although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors, including the type of mortgages, the coupon rate, borrower credit scores, loan to premises value, the age of mortgages, the geographical location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest rates, the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments.  During periods of falling mortgage interest rates, if the coupon rate of the underlying mortgages exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans, refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying mortgages and the related security.  Under such circumstances, the Company may be subject to reinvestment risk because, to the extent that the Company’s MBS amortize or prepay faster than anticipated, the Company may not be able to reinvest the proceeds of such repayments and prepayments at a comparable rate.  During periods of rising interest rates, these prepayments tend to decelerate as the prevailing market interest rates for mortgage rates increase and prepayment incentives dissipate.
The Company adopted Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2017-12, "Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements and Accounting for Hedging Activities", in 2018, which resulted in a transfer of $204.7 million of investment securities and $101.3 million of MBS from HTM to AFS during the first fiscal quarter of 2018. Additionally, the Crestmark Acquisition resulted in $40.9 million of investment securities being transferred from HTM to AFS during the fourth quarter of 2018, as allowed under ASC 310-10-25-6(c).
Management has implemented a process to identify securities with potential credit impairment that are other-than-temporary.  This process involves evaluation of the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, review of available information regarding the financial position of the issuer, monitoring the rating, watch, and outlook of the security, monitoring changes in value, cash flow projections, and the Company’s intent to sell a security or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost which, in some cases, may extend to maturity.  To the extent we determine that a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, an impairment loss is recognized.

For all securities considered temporarily impaired, the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, which may occur at maturity.  The Company believes it will collect all principal and interest due on all investments with amortized cost in excess of fair value and considered only temporarily impaired.

In fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were no other-than-temporary impairments recorded.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are both in conservatorship, generally provide the certificate holder a guarantee of timely payments of interest, whether or not collected.  Ginnie Mae’s guarantee to the holder is timely payments of principal and interest, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.
The Company holds marketable equity securities, which have readily determinable fair values, and include common equity and mutual funds. These securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, due to changes in fair value, reflected in earnings. Interest and dividend income from these securities is recognized in interest income. See Note 3. Securities for additional information on marketable equity securities.

Funding Activities

General
The Company’s sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, amortization and repayment of loan and lease principal, interest earned on or maturation of investment securities and funds provided from operations.

Borrowings, including FHLB advances, overnight federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, other short-term borrowings, and funds available through the FRB Discount Window, may be used at times to compensate for seasonal reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels, may be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending activities, and may also be used to match the funding of a corresponding asset.

Deposits  
The Company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms.  The Company’s deposits consist of statement savings accounts, money market savings accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal accounts ("NOW") and regular checking accounts, deposits related to prepaid cards primarily categorized as checking accounts and certificate accounts currently ranging in terms from three months to five years.  The Company solicits deposits from its primary market area and relies primarily on competitive pricing policies, advertising and high-quality customer service to attract and retain these deposits. In addition, the Company may periodically utilize brokered deposits to target strategic maturities related to its seasonal tax refund advance lending. The tax refund advance lending season typically lasts six weeks or less and it is generally more efficient to fund these short-term loans by using brokered deposits rather than by selling investment securities. Other sources of brokered deposits may also be utilized periodically to take advantage of balance sheet funding opportunities.
The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, and competition.

The variety of deposit accounts offered by the Company has allowed it to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand.  The Company endeavors to manage the pricing of its deposits in keeping with its asset/liability management and profitability objectives.  Based on its experience, the Company believes that its savings, money market accounts, NOW, regular checking accounts and deposits related to prepaid cards are relatively stable sources of deposits.  However, the ability of the Company to attract and maintain certificates of deposit and the rates paid on these deposits has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.

At September 30, 2019, $2.43 billion of the Company’s $4.34 billion deposit portfolio was attributable to the Payments segment. The majority of these deposits represent funds available to spend on prepaid debit cards and other stored value products, of which $2.31 billion are included with noninterest-bearing checking accounts and $125.6 million are included with interest-bearing checking and savings deposits on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  Generally, these deposits do not pay interest. The Payments segment originates debit card programs through outside sales agents and other financial institutions. As such, these deposits carry a somewhat higher degree of concentration risk than traditional consumer products. If a major client or card program were to leave the Bank, deposit outflows could be more significant than if the Bank were to lose a more traditional customer, although it is considered unlikely that all deposits related to a program would leave the Bank without significant advance notification. As such, and as historical results indicate, the Company believes that its deposit portfolio attributable to the Payments segment is stable. The increase in deposits arising from Payments has allowed the Bank to reduce its reliance on wholesale deposits, certificates of deposits and public funds, which typically have relatively higher costs.

At September 30, 2019, there were $32.7 million in deposits from governmental and other public entities included in certificates of deposit.

Borrowings  
Although deposits are the Company’s primary source of funds, the Company’s practice has been to utilize borrowings when they are a less costly source of funds, can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, or when the Company desires additional capacity to fund loan demand. Borrowings from various sources mature based on stated payment schedules.

The Company’s borrowings have historically consisted primarily of advances from the FHLB upon the security of a blanket collateral agreement of a percentage of unencumbered loans and the pledge of specific investment securities.  Such advances can be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities.  At September 30, 2019, the Bank had $642.0 million of overnight borrowings, $110.0 million term advances, and the ability to borrow up to an approximate additional $1.37 billion from the FHLB. 
The Company completed the public offering of $75.0 million of 5.75% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debentures during fiscal year 2016. These notes are due August 15, 2026. The subordinated debentures were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $73.9 million. At September 30, 2019, $73.6 million in aggregate principal amount in subordinated debentures, net of issuance costs of $1.4 million, were outstanding.
On July 16, 2001, the Company issued all of the 10,310 authorized shares of Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of First Midwest Financial Capital Trust I (preferred securities of subsidiary trust) holding solely trust preferred securities. Distributions are paid semi‑annually. Cumulative cash distributions are calculated at a variable rate LIBOR plus 3.75%, not to exceed 12.5%. The Company may, at one or more times, defer interest payments on the capital securities for up to 10 consecutive semi-annual periods, but not beyond July 25, 2031. At the end of any deferral period, all accumulated and unpaid distributions must be paid.  The capital securities are required to be redeemed on July 25, 2031; however, the Company has a semi‑annual option to shorten the maturity date. The option has not been exercised as of the date of this filing. The redemption price is $1,000 per capital security plus any accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption.  Holders of the capital securities have no voting rights, are unsecured, and rank junior in priority of payment to all of the Company’s indebtedness and senior to the Company’s common stock. The trust preferred securities have been includable in the Company’s capital calculations since they were issued. The preferential capital treatment of the Company’s trust preferred securities was grandfathered under recent banking legislation. The outstanding balance of the trust preferred securities at September 30, 2018 was $10.3 million.
Through the Crestmark Acquisition, the Company acquired $3.4 million in floating rate capital securities due to Crestmark Capital Trust I, a 100%-owned nonconsolidated subsidiary of the Company. The subordinated debentures bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%, have a stated maturity of 30 years from the date of issuance and are redeemable by the Company at par, with regulatory approval. The interest rate is reset quarterly at distribution dates in February, May, August, and November. The subsidiary has the option to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures from time to time for a period not to exceed five consecutive years. 
The Company has a line of credit with another financial institution for $25.0 million as of September 30, 2019. This line of credit has no fee, and, as of September 30, 2019, the Company has not drawn on it. 
From time to time, the Company has offered retail repurchase agreements to its customers.  These agreements typically range from 14 days to five years in term, and typically have been offered in minimum amounts of $100,000.  The proceeds of these transactions are used to meet cash flow needs of the Company.  At September 30, 2019, the Company had $4.0 million of retail repurchase agreements outstanding.
The following table sets forth the maximum month-end balance and average balance of FHLB advances, retail and reverse repurchase agreements, trust preferred securities, subordinated debentures, and overnight fed funds purchased for the periods indicated.

Subsidiary Activities

The subsidiaries of the Company are the Bank and First Midwest Financial Capital Trust I.

Payments Activities
The Company, through the MPS division, is focused on innovation in the fintech and payments industries. MPS offers a complement of prepaid cards, consumer credit products and other payment industry- related products and services that are marketed to consumers through financial institutions and other commercial entities on a nationwide basis.  The products and services offered by MPS are generally designed to facilitate the processing and settlement of authorized electronic transactions involving the movement of funds.  MPS offers specific product solutions in the areas of prepaid cards and ATM sponsorship. MPS’ products and services generally target banks, card processors, third parties that market and distribute the cards, resellers and independent tax preparers (EROs).

Each line of MPS’ business is discussed generally below. The Company cross-utilizes personnel and resources across these lines of business (for example, MPS may develop products for both prepaid and consumer credit needs pursuant to a client's request).

Prepaid Cards  
Prepaid cards are debit cards that are embedded with a magnetic stripe, which encodes relevant card data (which may or may not include information about the user and/or purchaser of such card), or an EMV chip, which is equipped with a microprocessor chip and the technology used to authenticate chip card transactions. When the holder of such a card attempts a permitted transaction, necessary information, including the authorization for such transaction, is shared between the “point of use” or “point of sale” and authorization systems maintaining the account of record. Most recently, “virtual” prepaid cards have become popular in the industry. Virtual prepaid cards are used in both the consumer space, for example as a gift card, and in the commercial arena to facilitate accounts payable and vendor payments. 
The funds associated with such cards are typically held in pooled accounts at the Bank representing the aggregate value of all cards issued in connection with particular products or programs. Although the funds are held in pooled accounts, the account of record indicates the funds held by each individual card.  The cards may work in a closed loop (e.g., the card will only work at one particular merchant and will not work anywhere else), a "Restricted Access Network" (e.g., the card will only work at a specific set of merchants such as a shopping mall), or in an open loop which functions as a Visa, MasterCard, or Discover branded debit card that will work wherever such cards are accepted for payment.  Most of MPS’ prepaid cards are open loop.
The MPS prepaid card business can generally be divided into two program categories:  Consumer Use and Business or Commercial Use products. These programs are typically offered through a third-party relationship.  
Consumer Use 
Examples of consumer use prepaid card programs include payroll, general purpose reloadable ("GPR"), reward, gift and benefit/HSA cards. Payroll cards are a product whereby an employee’s payroll is loaded to the card by their employer utilizing direct deposit. GPR cards are usually distributed by retailers and can be reloaded an indefinite number of times at participating retail load networks.  Other examples of reloadable cards are travel cards, which are used to replace traveler’s checks and can be reloaded a predetermined number of times, as well as tax-related cards where a taxpayer’s refund is placed on the card.  Reloadable cards are generally open- loop cards that consumers can use to obtain cash at ATMs or purchase goods and services wherever such cards are accepted for payment. 
Business or Commercial Use 
Prepaid cards are also frequently used by businesses for travel and entertainment, accounts payable and B2B settlement products. For example, virtual prepaid cards are used to facilitate one-time payments between a company and its vendors for monthly settlement. Travel and entertainment cards, alternatively, are reloadable by the company for use by its employees to travel for business. 

ATM Sponsorship
MPS sponsors ATM independent sales organizations (“ISOs”) into various networks and provides associated sponsorships of encryption support organizations and third-party processors in support of the financial institutions and the ATM ISO sponsorships.  Sponsorship consists of the review and oversight of entities participating in debit and credit networks.  In certain instances, MPS also has certain leasehold interests in certain ATMs which require bank ownership and registration for compliance with applicable state law.
While the Company has adopted policies and procedures to manage and monitor the risks attendant to this line of business, and the executives who manage the Company’s program have years of experience in this area of the Company's business, no guarantee can be made that the Company will not experience losses in the MPS division.  MPS has signed agreements with terms extending through the next few years with several of its largest sales agents/program managers, which the Company expects will help mitigate this risk. 
Regulation and Supervision
General
The business of both the Company and the Bank and their subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in connection with their respective businesses and operations. The Bank, which operates as a federal savings bank, is supervised and examined by the OCC, its primary federal regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the federal agency that administers the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). As a savings and loan holding company (an "SLHC"), the Company is supervised and examined by the FRB. Federal banking policy is designed to protect customers of and depositors in insured depository institutions, the DIF, and the U.S. banking system.

The framework by which both the Bank and the Company are supervised and examined is complex. This framework includes acts of Congress, regulations, policy statements and guidance, and other interpretive materials which define the obligations and requirements for entities participating in the U.S. banking system.
Moreover, regulation of banks and their holding companies is subject to continual revision, both through statutory changes and corresponding regulatory revisions as well as through evolving supervisory objectives of banking agency examiners and supervisory staff. It is not possible to predict the content or timing of changes to the laws and regulations that may impact the business of the Bank and the Company. Any changes to the regulatory framework applicable to the Company or the Bank, however, could have a material adverse impact on the condition or operations of each entity. 
In addition to regulation and supervision by the FRB, the Company is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and is required to file reports with the SEC and otherwise comply with federal securities laws. 
As described broadly below, the banking industry is subject to significant regulation. The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by the U.S. banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on the Company or the Bank. Rather, it is intended to briefly summarize the legal and regulatory framework in which the Bank and the Company operate and describe legal requirements that impact their businesses and operations. The information set forth below is subject to change and is qualified in its entirety by the actual laws and regulations referenced.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the federal regulatory framework, affecting the operation of insured depository institutions and their holding companies, impacting the lending, deposit, investment, compliance and operating activities of such entities. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing regulations and rules, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, although many of the statutory requirements have been satisfied, the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act cannot be determined, as not all of the law’s statutory requirements have been implemented; moreover, certain provisions of the act that were implemented by federal agencies have been revised or rescinded pursuant to legislative changes adopted by the U.S. Congress. See “The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (“Regulatory Relief Act”)” below.
Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that directly impact the operation of the Company or the Bank are highlighted below: 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bank is subject to regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “Bureau”).  The Bureau has consolidated authority related to federal laws and regulations impacting the provision of consumer financial products and services. The Bureau also has substantial power to define the rights of consumers and responsibilities of lending institutions, such as the Bank.  The Bureau does not, however, examine or supervise the Bank for compliance with such laws and regulations; rather, based on the Bank’s size (less than $10 billion in assets), enforcement authority remains with the OCC, although the Bank may be required to submit reports or other materials to the Bureau upon request.  The Dodd-Frank Act also provides state attorneys general with the right to enforce federal consumer protection laws. The Bureau is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service ("UDAAP authority"). To date, the Bureau has engaged in rulemaking and taken enforcement actions that directly impact the business operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the Bank and its divisions.
Interchange Fees.  The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that restrict interchange fees to those which are “reasonable and proportionate” for certain debit card issuers and limits the ability of networks and issuers to restrict debit card transaction routing (known as the “Durbin Amendment”).  The Federal Reserve issued final rules implementing the Durbin Amendment on June 29, 2011. Although, as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the interchange fee restrictions in the Durbin Amendment do not apply to the Bank because debit card issuers with total worldwide assets of less than $10 billion are exempt, such restrictions may negatively impact the pricing all debit card processors in the market, including the Bank, may charge.
Incentive Compensation. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC, issue a rule related to incentive-based compensation. No final rule implementing this provision of the Dodd-Frank Act has, as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, been adopted, but a proposed rule was published in 2016 that expanded upon a prior proposed rule published in 2011. The proposed rule is intended to (i) prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that the banking regulators determine could encourage certain financial institutions to take inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss, (ii) require the board of directors of those financial institutions to take certain oversight actions related to incentive-based compensation, and (iii) require those financial institutions to disclose information concerning incentive-based compensation arrangements to the appropriate federal regulator. Although a final rule has not been issued, the Company and the Bank have undertaken efforts to ensure that their incentive compensation plans do not encourage inappropriate risks, consistent with the principles identified above.
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (“Regulatory Relief Act”). Enacted on May 24, 2018, the Regulatory Relief Act includes a number of provisions that positively affect smaller banking institutions (e.g., those with less than $10 billion in assets) like the Bank. Specific provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act that benefit smaller banks include modifications to the “qualified mortgage” criteria under the “ability to repay” rules for certain mortgages that are held and maintained on the Bank’s retained portfolio as well as relief from certain capital requirements required by an international banking capital framework with the creation of a “community bank leverage ratio.” See “Recent Developments Related to Capital Rules.”
Bank Regulation and Supervision
The Bank is a federal savings bank that is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight extending to all of its operations by its primary federal regulator, the OCC, and by its deposit insurer, the FDIC.  Such regulation covers all aspects of the banking business, including lending practices, safeguarding deposits, capital structure, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel.  The Bank pays assessment fees both to the OCC and the FDIC, and the level of such assessments reflects the condition of the Bank.  If the condition of the Bank were to deteriorate, the level of such assessments could increase significantly, having a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. 
Regulatory authorities have been granted extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities which are intended to strengthen the financial condition of the banking industry, including, but not limited to, the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution, and the adequacy of an institution’s allowance for loan and lease losses.  Typically, these actions are undertaken due to violations of laws or regulations or conduct of operations in an unsafe or unsound manner.  
The Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act (“HOLA”) and the OCC’s implementing regulations thereunder.  Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets.  The Bank may also establish service corporations that are permitted to engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the Bank, including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage activities; provided, however, that such investments are limited to 3% of the Bank's assets.  These investment powers are, however, subject to various limitations. The Bank’s general permissible lending limit to one borrower is equal to the greater of $500,000 or 15% of the Bank's unimpaired capital and surplus (except when the loans made in excess of the 15% maximum are fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral, in which case this limit is increased to 25% of unimpaired capital and surplus).  At September 30, 2019, the Bank was in compliance with this lending limit.
The OCC announced on October 1, 2019 that its supervisory strategies for 2020 will focus on the following: (a) cybersecurity and operational resiliency; (b) Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) compliance management; (c) commercial and retail credit underwriting practices and oversight and control functions; (d) impact of changing interest rate outlooks on bank activities and risk exposures; (e) preparedness for the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) account standard, and preparation for the potential phase-out of the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”); and (f) technological innovation and implementation.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC
The Bank is a member of the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, a permanent increase in deposit insurance to $250,000 was authorized.  The coverage limit is per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category. FDIC insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. 
While not the Bank's primary federal regulator, the FDIC, as insurer of the Bank's deposits, imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order poses a serious risk to the DIF. The FDIC also has authority to initiate enforcement actions against any FDIC-insured institution after giving its primary federal regulator the opportunity to take such action, and may seek to terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. Finally, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC or the OCC. 
The FDIC imposes an assessment against all depository institutions for deposit insurance quarterly. FDIC assessment rates range from 3 to 30 basis points annually and take into account an institution’s composite CAMELS rating and other factors. Notably, the FDIC has the authority to increase an institution’s deposit insurance premium if it determines that an insured depository institution significantly relies upon brokered deposits. As of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Bank’s deposit insurance assessment rate was 14 basis points, 9 basis points, and 9 basis points, respectively. The Bank’s deposit insurance premium expense totaled $6.8 million for 2019, $3.8 million for 2018, and $2.9 million for 2017. A significant increase in DIF insurance premiums would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank.
On November 28, 2018, the FDIC announced that the designated reserve ratio (“DRR”) of the DIF reached 1.36% as of September 30, 2018, exceeding the statutorily required 1.35% two years ahead of the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. Banks with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Bank, have begun receiving credits against their deposit insurance assessments when the DRR reaches or exceeds 1.38%. These small bank assessment credits were applied to the Company's June 2019 quarterly statement in the amount of $1.3 million, which was received and applied during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Brokered Deposits
The FDIC limits the ability to accept brokered deposits to those insured depository institutions that are well capitalized. Institutions that are less than well capitalized cannot accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless they have applied for and been granted a waiver by the FDIC.  The FDIC has defined the “national rate” for all interest-bearing deposits held by less-than-well-capitalized institutions as “a simple average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and branches for which data are available” and has stated that its presumption is that this national rate is the prevailing rate in any market.  As such, institutions that are less than well capitalized that are permitted to accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits via FDIC waiver generally may not pay an interest rate in excess of the national rate plus 75 basis points on such brokered deposits. Notably, the FDIC published a proposed rule to modify the “national rate” definition that would apply to insured depository institutions that are less than well-capitalized in August 2019; no final rule has been published as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2019, the Bank categorized $2.55 billion, or 58.9% of its deposit liabilities, as brokered deposits.
The FDIC has previously published industry guidance in the form of Frequently Asked Questions with respect to the categorization of deposit liabilities as brokered deposits. In addition, in February 2019, the FDIC published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking requesting information from the public regarding the appropriate regulatory approach to brokered deposits. It is not possible to determine whether a final rule regarding a revised regulatory treatment of brokered deposits will be adopted or, if adopted, whether such final related regulation will have a material adverse effect on the Bank. 
Branching by Federal Savings Banks
Subject to certain limitations, the HOLA and the OCC regulations permit federally chartered savings banks to establish branches in any state of the United States.  The authority to establish such branches is available if the law of the state in which the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch if the savings association retains its status as a qualified thrift lender or domestic building and loan association and the total assets of the federal savings bank attributable to all of the federal savings association’s branches in such state would qualify the branches as a whole as a qualified thrift lender or domestic building and loan association (although this last factor does not apply if a state savings association chartered by the home state of the federal savings association would be permitted to branch in the other state). The branching authority under the HOLA and the OCC regulations preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings associations. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Bank has entered into an agreement with a third party to purchase the Bank's branches and certain assets and liabilities related thereto. If the sale of these branches is consummated, the Bank's only office open to the public would be its home office, where it would accept deposits. See "Community Banking-Sale of Community Bank Division."
Qualified Thrift Lender Test
All savings associations, including the Bank, are required to meet a qualified thrift lender (“QTL”) test to avoid certain restrictions on their operations.  This test requires a savings association to have at least 65% of its portfolio assets (as defined by regulation) in qualified thrift investments (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain MBS) on a monthly average for nine out of every 12 months on a rolling basis or meet the requirements for a domestic building and loan association under the Internal Revenue Code.  Under either test, the required assets primarily consist of residential housing related to loans and investments.  
Any savings association that fails to meet the QTL test must convert to a national bank charter, unless it qualifies as a QTL within one year and thereafter remains a QTL, or limits its new investments and activities to those permissible for both a savings association and a national bank.  In addition, the association is subject to national bank limits for payment of dividends and branching authority.  If such association has not requalified or converted to a national bank within three years after the failure, it must divest all investments and cease all activities not permissible for a national bank or federal savings association. 
Consumer Mortgage Lending
The Bureau finalized its ability to repay (“ATR”) rule in January 2013.  The ATR rule applies to residential mortgage loan applications received after January 10, 2014.  The scope of the ATR rule specifically applies to loans securing one-to-four unit dwellings and includes purchases, refinances and home equity loans for principal or second homes.  Under the ATR rules, a lender may not make a residential mortgage loan unless the lender makes a reasonable and good faith determination that is based on verified, documented information at or before consummation that the borrower has a reasonable ability to repay.  To determine a consumer’s reasonable ability to pay, a lender must review eight underwriting factors prescribed in the rule.  Liability for violations of the ATR rule include actual damages, statutory damages, court costs, and attorneys’ fees.
Additionally, the Bureau regulates “qualified mortgages” (“QMs”), which are mortgages for which there is a presumption that the lender has satisfied the ATR rules.  Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, QMs must have certain product-feature prerequisites and affordability underwriting requirements.  Generally, to meet the QM test, the lender must calculate the monthly payments under the loan based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years and the consumer must have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43%.  The QM rule provides a safe harbor for lenders that make loans that satisfy the definition of a QM and are not higher priced.  With respect to higher-priced mortgage loans, there is a rebuttable presumption of compliance available to the lender with respect to compliance with the ATR rule.
With respect to QMs, the Regulatory Relief Act allows insured depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, like the Bank, to designate certain consumer mortgage loans it originates and holds in portfolio as QMs even though such mortgage loans do not meet the ATR requirements described above. 
Prepaid Accounts under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ("Regulation E") and the Truth In Lending Act ("Regulation Z")
The Bureau’s “Prepaid Accounts Rule,” adopted on October 5, 2016, enhanced the regulations applicable to prepaid products and brought them fully within Regulation E, which implements the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act, In addition, prepaid products that have a credit component, like some of those offered in connection with an existing program manager agreement, are now regulated by Regulation Z, which implements the federal Truth in Lending Act. The rule also extended Regulation Z’s credit card rules and disclosure requirements to prepaid accounts that provide overdraft services and other credit features. These rules became effective on April 1, 2019.
Short-Term, Small-Dollar Installment Lending
In October 2017, the OCC rescinded its guidance on deposit advance products in light of the Bureau’s pending small dollar loan rule related to payday, vehicle title and certain high cost installment loans that was issued in November 2017 (“Small Dollar Rule”). The Small Dollar Rule, however, has been the subject of litigation and further regulatory review and is not yet effective. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Bureau has delayed the Small Dollar Rule’s compliance date until November 2020, and has separately proposed rescinding in its entirety the underwriting provisions in the Small Dollar Rule that require lenders to determine a consumer’s ability to repay prior to providing a covered loan. The Bureau has not, however, sought to rescind the separate payment provisions in the Small Dollar Rule that affect longer term consumer loans with an Annual Percentage Rate that exceeds 36%. 
Separately, in May 2018, the OCC published guidance that encourages national banks and federal savings associations to offer responsible short-term, small-dollar installment loans with terms between two and twelve months and equal amortizing payments. Pursuant to the OCC’s guidance on this issue, banks are encouraged to offer these products in a manner that is consistent with sound risk management principles and clear, documented underwriting guidelines. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Bank has not determined to offer such products, although this position may change as the Bank further refines its business plan in the future.
Interest Rate Risk Management
The OCC requires federal savings banks, like the Bank, to have an effective and sound interest rate risk management program, including appropriate measurement and reporting, robust and meaningful stress testing, assumption development reflecting the institution’s experience, and comprehensive model valuations.  According to OCC guidance, interest rate risk exposure is supposed to be managed using processes and systems commensurate with their earnings and capital levels; complexity; business model; risk profile; and scope of operations. 
Standards for Safety and Soundness
The federal banking agencies have adopted the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness.  The guidelines establish certain safety and soundness standards for all depository institutions.  The operational and managerial standards in the guidelines generally relate to the following:  (1) internal controls and information systems; (2) internal audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate exposure; (6) asset growth; (7) compensation, fees and benefits; (8) asset quality; and (9) earnings.  Failure to meet the standards in the guidelines could result in a request by the OCC to the Bank to provide a written compliance plan to demonstrate its efforts to come into compliance with such guidelines.
Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) Laws and Regulations
AML and financial transparency laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the U.S. Patriot Act of 2001, impose strict standards for gathering and verifying customer information in order to ensure funds or other assets are not being placed in U.S. financial institutions to facilitate terrorist financing and laundering of funds.  Applicable laws require financial institutions to have AML programs in place and require banking regulators to consider a holding company’s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on certain merger or acquisition applications. In addition, failure to comply with these requirements could lead to significant fines and penalties or the imposition of corrective orders. 
Customer Identification Programs for Holders of Prepaid Cards
The federal banking agencies, including the OCC and the FRB, issued guidance in 2016 that extends the requirements of the Customer Identification Program required by Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act to prepaid accounts where the cardholder has either the (i) ability to reload funds, or (ii) access to credit or overdraft features. If either of these features is present, the issuer must verify the identity of the named account holder. 
Privacy
The Bank is required by federal statutes and regulations to disclose its privacy policies to its customers. The Bank is also required to appropriately safeguard its customers’ personal information. In addition, certain state laws could potentially impact the Bank’s operations, including those related to applicable notification requirements when unauthorized access to customers’ nonpublic personal information has occurred.
Examination Guidance for Third-Party Lending
On July 29, 2016, the FDIC issued revised examination guidance related to third-party lending relationships (e.g., lending arrangements that rely on a third party to perform a significant aspect of the lending process). Similar to guidance published by the OCC in 2013, this guidance generally requires that financial institutions, including the Bank, ensure that risks related to such third-party lending relationships are evaluated, including the type of lending activity, the complexity of the lending program, the projected and realized volume created by the relationship, and the number of third-party lending relationships the institution has in place. 
Unclaimed Property Laws
Unclaimed property (escheatment) laws vary by state but generally require holders of customer property (including money) to turn over such property to the applicable state after holding the property for the statutorily prescribed period of time. These laws are not uniform and impose varying requirements on entities, like the Bank, which may hold funds that are required to be escheated to the applicable states. 
Assessments
The Dodd-Frank Act provides that, in establishing the amount of an assessment, the Comptroller of the Currency may consider the nature and scope of the activities of the entity, the amount and type of assets it holds, the financial and managerial condition of the entity and any other factor that is appropriate. The assessments are paid to the OCC on a semi-annual basis. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Bank paid assessments (standard assessments) of $958,303 to the OCC.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
The regulatory capital rules applicable to the Company and the Bank (the “Capital Rules”) identify three components of regulatory capital: (i) common equity tier 1 capital (“CET1 Capital”), (ii) additional tier 1 capital, and (iii) tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1 Capital and additional tier 1 capital instruments meeting certain requirements. Total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital. CET1 Capital, tier 1 capital, and total capital serve as the numerators for three prescribed regulatory capital ratios. Risk-weighted assets, calculated using the standardized approach in the Capital Rules for us and the Bank, provide the denominator for such ratios. There is also a leverage ratio that compares tier 1 capital to average total assets.
Failure by the Company or the Bank to meet minimum capital requirements set by the Capital Rules could result in certain mandatory and/or discretionary disciplinary actions by their regulators that could have a material adverse effect on their business and their consolidated financial position. Under the capital requirements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (discussed below), the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company's and the Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s and the Bank’s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
The Company and the Bank are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is exclusively composed of CET1 Capital and applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios (but not the leverage ratio). 
The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1 Capital.  These include, for example, the requirement that deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 Capital to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 Capital or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1 Capital.  See Note 15 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” which is included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings for a large and risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in high-risk weights for a variety of asset classes.
As of September 30, 2019, the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements and was designated as “well capitalized” under federal guidelines. See Note 15 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” which is included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that are used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies.  Management reviews these measures along with other measures of capital as part of its financial analysis.
Recent Developments Related to Capital Rules
There have been several developments which are intended to reduce the regulatory capital burden on smaller, less complex banking organizations like the Company and the Bank. The effect that these developments will have on the Company and the Bank is currently uncertain.
In July 2019, the OCC, the FDIC, and the FRB adopted a final rule that simplifies certain aspects of the Capital Rules as they relate to small federal savings banks and SLHCs. Specifically, this rule (1) simplifies the current regulatory capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets (MSA), temporary difference deferred tax assets (DTA), and holdings of regulatory capital instruments issued by other financial institutions; and (2) simplifies the calculation for limitations on minority interest includable in regulatory capital. The rule comes into effect on January 1, 2020, and a regulated entity must satisfy certain conditions and make an election before it becomes subject to the rule. The Bank is currently in the process of assessing the potential impact of this election.
On November 21, 2018, the FDIC, the OCC, and the FRB jointly issued a proposed rule required by the Regulatory Relief Act that would permit qualifying banks that have less than $10 billion in consolidated assets to elect to be subject to a 9% leverage ratio that would be applied using less complex leverage calculations (referred to as the “community bank leverage ratio” or “CBLR”). Under the proposed rule, banks that opt into the CBLR framework and maintain a CBLR of greater than 9% would not be subject to other risk-based and leverage capital requirements and would be deemed to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements. The rule was adopted by the FDIC, OCC, and FRB in September 2019. The Bank is currently in the process of assessing the potential impact of this election. 
Prompt Corrective Action ("PCA")
Federal banking regulators are authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their minimum capital requirements expressed in terms of a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a CET1 ratio, and a leverage ratio (as identified in the tables above).
Well capitalized banks may not make a capital distribution or pay management fees if the bank would be undercapitalized after making such distributions or paying such fees. Adequately capitalized banks, in general, cannot pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would leave them undercapitalized; they cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person if, after paying the fee, they would be undercapitalized; and they cannot accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless they have applied for and been granted a waiver by the FDIC. 
The activities of an “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized” bank are further restricted.  Any such bank must submit a capital restoration plan that is guaranteed by each company that controls the Bank, and such company must provide appropriate assurances of performance.  Until such plan is approved, the bank may not increase its assets, acquire another institution, establish a branch or engage in any new activities, and generally may not make capital distributions.  The banking regulators are authorized to impose additional restrictions, discussed below, that are applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions.
The imposition of any action taken by the OCC against the Bank in connection with the agency’s PCA authority would likely have a substantial adverse effect on it and on the Company’s operations and profitability.  This is especially true if the Bank were to no longer be deemed to be well capitalized and, therefore, subject to limitations on its ability to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC. The Company's stockholders are not entitled to preemptive rights and, therefore, if the Company is directed by its regulators to issue additional shares of common stock, such issuance may result in dilution to the Company's existing stockholders.
Institutions in Troubled Condition
Certain events, including entering into a formal written agreement with a bank’s regulator that requires action to improve the bank’s financial condition, or being informed by the regulator that the bank is in troubled condition, will automatically result in limitations on so-called “golden parachute” agreements pursuant to Section 18(K) of the FDIA.  In addition, organizations that are not in compliance with minimum capital requirements, or are otherwise in a troubled condition, must give 90 days’ written notice to the OCC before appointing a Director or Senior Executive Officer, pursuant to the OCC’s regulations.
Civil Money Penalties
The OCC has the authority to assess civil money penalties (“CMPs”) against any national bank, federal savings bank or any of their institution-affiliated parties (“IAPs”). In addition, the OCC has the authority to assess CMPs against bank service companies and service providers. CMPs may encourage an affected party to correct violations, unsafe or unsound practices or breaches of fiduciary duty. CMPs are also intended to serve as a deterrent to future violations of law, regulations, orders and other conditions. 
Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions
Federal regulations govern the permissibility of capital distributions by a federal savings association. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, savings associations that are part of a savings and loan holding company structure must file a notice of a declaration of a dividend with the Federal Reserve at least 30 days before the proposed dividend declaration by the Bank’s board of directors. In the case of cash dividends, OCC regulations require that federal savings associations that are subsidiaries of a stock SLHC must file an informational copy of that notice with the OCC at the same time the notice is filed with the Federal Reserve. OCC regulations further set forth the circumstances under which a federal savings association is required to submit an application or notice before it may make a capital distribution.
Each of the Federal Reserve and OCC have primary reviewing responsibility for the applications or notices required to be submitted to them by savings associations relating to a proposed distribution. The Federal Reserve may disapprove of a notice, and the OCC may disapprove of a notice or deny an application, if: (a) the savings association would be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized following the distribution; (b) the proposed distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or (c) the proposed distribution violates a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation, enforcement action or agreement between the savings association (or its holding company, in the case of the Federal Reserve) and the entity’s primary federal regulator, or a condition imposed on the savings association (or its holding company, in the case of the Federal Reserve) in an application or notice approved by the entity’s primary federal regulator.
Under current regulations, the Bank is not permitted to pay dividends on its stock if its regulatory capital would fall below the amount required for the liquidation account established to provide a limited priority claim to the assets of the Bank to qualifying depositors at March 31, 1992, who continue to maintain deposits at the Bank after its conversion from a federal mutual savings and loan association to a federal stock savings bank pursuant to its Plan of Conversion adopted August 21, 1991.
The Bank paid cash dividends in the amount of $34.0 million to the Company during fiscal 2019, to be used to fund share repurchases under the common stock share repurchase program that was authorized by the Company's Board of Directors during the fiscal 2019 second quarter. The program authorized the Company to repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock and became effective on May 1, 2019. During fiscal year 2019, the Company repurchased a total of $46.5 million, or 1,680,772 shares of its common stock, at an average price of $27.67 per share under the repurchase program. The Company does not currently anticipate that it will need dividends from the Bank in order to fund dividends to the Company’s stockholders.
Transactions with Affiliates
The Bank must comply with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act relative to transactions with “affiliates,” generally defined to mean any company that controls or is under common control with the institution (as such, The Company is an affiliate of the Bank for these purposes).  Transactions between an institution or its subsidiaries and its affiliates are required to be on terms as favorable to the Bank as terms prevailing at the time for transactions with non-affiliates.  Certain transactions, such as loans to an affiliate, are restricted to a percentage of the institutions’ capital (e.g., the aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the institution; the aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the institution’s capital and surplus).  In addition, an SLHC may not lend to any affiliate engaged in activities not permissible for an SLHC or acquire the securities of most affiliates.  
Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”)
Under the CRA, the Bank is evaluated periodically by its primary federal banking regulator to determine if it is meeting its continuing and affirmative obligations consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its assessment areas, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.  CRA ratings can also impact an insured depository institution’s ability to engage in certain activities as CRA performance is considered in connection with certain applications by depository institutions and their holding companies, including merger applications, charter applications, and applications to acquire assets or assume liabilities. The Bank received a “Satisfactory” rating during its most recent Performance Evaluation dated January 3, 2017.
Federal Home Loan Bank System
The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB"), one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of savings associations that is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Housing Finance Agency.  All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB.  In addition, all long-term advances must be used for residential home financing.
As a member of the FHLB system, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain activity-based capital stock in the FHLB in the amount specified by the applicable FHLB's capital plan. At September 30, 2019, the Bank had in the aggregate $30.9 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with the FHLB of Des Moines' requirement.  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, dividends paid by the FHLB to the Bank totaled $1.0 million.
Other Regulation
The Bank is also subject to a variety of other regulations with respect to its business operations including, but not limited to, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Military Lending Act, the Servicemembers’ Civil Relief Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
It is possible that additional rulemaking could require significant revisions to the regulations under which the Bank operates and is supervised. Any change in such laws and regulations or interpretations thereof negatively impacting the Bank's or the Company's current operations, whether by the OCC, the FDIC, the Bureau, the FRB or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and its operations and on the Company and its stockholders. 
Holding Company Regulation and Supervision
The Company is a registered SLHC, and as such, it is subject to examination, supervision, and certain reporting requirements by the Federal Reserve, which has responsibility for the primary regulation and supervision of all SLHCs, including the Company.  In connection with its regulatory authority over SLHCs, the Federal Reserve determines who can own and control federal savings banks and sets minimum requirements for operation (including but not limited to capital and liquidity requirements). Through the supervisory process, the Federal Reserve ensures that SLHCs, like the Company, comply with law and regulation and are operated in a manner that is consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The Federal Reserve supervises SLHCs pursuant to an interim final rule (“Regulation LL”) and a supervisory program that is similar in nature to that used for bank holding companies.
Acquisitions
Federal law prohibits an SLHC, including us, directly or indirectly, from: (a) acquiring control (as defined under the HOLA) of another savings institution (or a holding company parent) without prior Federal Reserve approval; or (b) through merger, consolidation or purchase of assets, acquiring another savings institution or a holding company thereof, or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of such institution (or a holding company), without prior Federal Reserve approval. Additionally, the HOLA prohibits an SLHC (directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries) from acquiring or retaining, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of the voting shares of a non‑subsidiary savings association, a non-subsidiary holding company or a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the HOLA.  In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations, the Federal Reserve must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the DIF, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
Change in Bank Control
Federal law and regulation set forth the types of transactions that require prior notice under the Change in Bank Control Act.  Pursuant to Regulation LL, any person (acting directly or indirectly) that seeks to acquire control of a bank or its holding company must provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve. A “person” includes an individual, bank, corporation, partnership, trust, association, joint venture, pool, syndicate, sole proprietorship, unincorporated organization, or any other form of entity. A person acquires "control" of a banking organization whenever the person acquires ownership, control, or the power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the institution. The applicable regulations also provide for certain other "rebuttable" presumptions of control. In April 2019, the FRB published a proposed rule intended to streamline certain of the FRB’s rules for determining whether a company has control over another company for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act and the HOLA. 
Source of Strength and Capital Requirements
The Dodd-Frank Act requires all companies, including SLHCs, that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to maintain adequate resources to support such institutions; to date, however, specific regulations implementing this requirement have not been published.  As an SLHC, the Company is also subject to the same regulatory capital requirements as the Bank. 
Examination
The Federal Reserve has stated that it intends, to the greatest extent possible, taking into account any unique characteristics of SLHCs and the requirements of the HOLA, to assess the condition, performance and activities of SLHCs on a consolidated basis in a manner that is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s established risk-based approach regarding bank holding company supervision.  The Federal Reserve’s objective is to ensure that an SLHC and its non-depository subsidiaries are effectively supervised and to ensure that it can serve as a source of strength for, and does not threaten the soundness of, its subsidiary depository institution(s).
In 2019, the Federal Reserve published finalized guidance with respect to inspection frequency and scope for SLHCs and bank holding companies with less than $10 billion in assets. According to the Federal Reserve, with respect to institutions with less than $10 billion in assets (such as the Company), the determination of whether a holding company is "complex" versus "noncomplex" is made at least annually on a case-by-case basis taking into account and weighing a number of considerations, such as: the size and structure of the holding company; the extent of intercompany transactions between insured depository institution subsidiaries and the holding company or uninsured subsidiaries of the holding company; the nature and scale of any non-bank activities; and the degree of leverage of the holding company, including the extent of its debt outstanding to the public.
Failure to Meet QTL Test
If a banking subsidiary of an SLHC fails to meet the QTL test, the holding company must register with the FRB as a bank holding company within one year of the savings institution’s failure to comply. 
Dividends
In 2009, the Federal Reserve released a supervisory letter entitled Applying Supervisory Guidance and Regulations on the Payment of Dividends, Stock Redemptions and Stock Repurchases at Bank Holding Companies (which is also now applicable to SLHCs). This letter generally sets forth principles describing when a bank holding company or SLHC must consult, provide notice, or seek approval from the FRB prior to a capital distribution including the payment of dividends, stock redemptions, or stock repurchases. According to FRB staff, the FRBs are likely to require holding companies to eliminate, defer or reduce dividends if these payments are not fully covered by the net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, earnings retention is not consistent with capital needs or the holding company will not meet or is in danger of not meeting minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
Management
In August 2017, the Federal Reserve published proposed guidance related to supervisory expectations for boards of directors, including boards of directors of savings and loan holding companies. The proposal seeks to clarify supervisory expectations of boards and distinguish the roles held by senior management to allow boards to focus on fulfilling their core responsibilities. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no final guidance has yet been published.
Additional Regulatory Matters
The Company is subject to oversight by the SEC, NASDAQ and various state securities regulators. In the normal course of business, the Company has received requests for information from these regulators. Such requests have been considered routine and incidental to the Company’s operations. 
Federal and State Taxation

Federal and State Taxation  
Meta and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and various consolidated state income tax returns. Additionally, Meta or its subsidiaries file separate company income tax returns in states where required.  All returns are filed on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The Company monitors relevant tax authorities and changes its estimate of accrued income tax due to changes in income or franchise tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities.
Competition
The Company operates in competitive markets for each of the different financial sectors in which it engages in business: payments, commercial finance, tax services, community banking and consumer lending.  Competitors include a wide range of regional and national banks and financial services companies located both in the Company's market areas and across the nation.  
The Company’s payments division serves customers nationally and also faces strong competition from large commercial banks and specialty providers of electronic payments processing and servicing, including prepaid, debit and credit card issuers, Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) processors and ATM network sponsors.  Many of these national players are aggressive competitors, leveraging relationships and economies of scale.
As part of its national lending operations, the Company also faces strong competition from non-bank commercial finance companies, leasing companies, factoring companies, insurance premium finance companies, consumer finance and others on a nationwide basis.  In addition, the Company’s tax return processing services division competes nationwide with financial institutions that offer similar processing technologies and capabilities.
The Company’s Community Banking division faces strong competition for loans and deposits, primarily competing with commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions located in the communities they serve.  Some of these competitors are local, while others are statewide or nationwide.  The Community Banking division's loans and deposits are attracted through its offices, primarily from the communities in which the offices are located.
Employees
At September 30, 2019, the Company and its subsidiaries had a total of 1,186 full-time equivalent employees, a decrease of 33 employees, or 3%, from September 30, 2018. The Company’s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group.  Management considers its employee relations to be good.
