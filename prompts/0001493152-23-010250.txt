ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Our Corporate History
 
We are a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Nevada. The original business started in 1993 as Ferris Productions, Inc. In September 2001, Ferris Productions, Inc. merged with GameCom, Inc. to ultimately become VirTra Systems, Inc., a Texas corporation.
 
Effective as of October 1, 2016, we completed a conversion from a Texas corporation to a Nevada corporation pursuant to a Redomestication Plan of Conversion (the “Plan of Conversion”) that was approved by our Board of Directors on June 23, 2016, and by our stockholders on September 16, 2016.
 
As part of the Plan of Conversion, we filed Articles of Incorporation in Nevada whereby we changed our name from VirTra Systems, Inc. to VirTra, Inc. and revised our capitalization. Our Articles of Incorporation filed in Nevada authorize us to issue 62,500,000 shares, of which (1) 60,000,000 shares shall be common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), of which (a) 50,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, (b) 2,500,000 shares shall be Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and (c) 7,500,000 shares shall be Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class B Common Stock”) and (2) 2,500,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which may, at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, be issued in one or more series (the “Preferred Stock”). We also adopted new bylaws as part of the Plan of Conversion.
 
Effective March 2, 2018, we effected a 1-for-2 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). All references to shares of our Common Stock in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to the number of shares of Common Stock after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split and are presented as if the Reverse Stock Split had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.

Business Overview
 
VirTra, Inc. (the “Company,” “VirTra,” “we,” “us” and “our”), located in Chandler, Arizona, is a global provider of judgmental use of force training simulators and firearms training simulators for the law enforcement, military, and commercial markets. The Company’s patented technologies, software, and scenarios provide intense training for de-escalation, judgmental use-of-force, marksmanship and related training that mimics real-world situations. VirTra’s mission is to save and improve lives worldwide through highly effective virtual reality and simulator technology.
 
The VirTra firearms training simulator allows marksmanship and realistic scenario-based training to take place on a daily basis without the need for a shooting range, protective equipment, role players, safety officers, or a scenario-based training site. We have developed a higher standard in simulation training including capabilities such as: multi-screen, video-based scenarios, unique scenario authoring ability, superior training scenarios, the patented Threat-Fire™ shoot-back system, powerful gas-powered simulated recoil weapons, and more. The simulator also allows students to receive immediate feedback from the instructor without the potential for sustaining injuries by the instructor or the students. The instructor is able to teach and re-mediate critical issues, while placing realistic stress on the students due to the realism and safe training environment created by the VirTra simulator.
 
Business Strategy
 
We have two main customer groups, namely, law enforcement, and military. These are different markets and require different sales and marketing programs as well as personnel. Our focus is to expand the market share and scope of our training simulators sales to these identified customer groups by pursuing the following key growth strategies:

● | Build Our Core Business. Our goal is to profitably grow our market share by continuing to develop, produce and market the most effective simulators possible. Through disciplined growth in our business, we have achieved a solid balance sheet by increasing our working capital and limiting our bank debt. We plan to add staff to our experienced management team as needed to meet the expected increase in demand for our products and services as we increase our marketing and sales activities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increase Total Addressable Market. We plan to increase the size of our total addressable market. This effort will focus on new marketing and new product and/or service offerings for the purpose of widening the number of types of customers who might consider our products or services uniquely compelling. 
● | Broaden Product Offerings. Since its formation in 1993, our company has had a proud tradition of innovation in the field of simulation and virtual reality. We plan to release revolutionary new products and services, as well as to continue incremental improvements to existing product lines. In some cases, the Company may enter a new market segment via the introduction of a new type of product or service. 
● | Partners and Acquisitions. We try to spend our time and funds wisely and not tackle tasks that can be done more efficiently with partners. For example, international distribution is often best accomplished through a local distributor or agent. We are also open to the potential of acquiring additional businesses or of being acquired ourselves, based on what is expected to be optimal for our long-term future and our stockholders. 

Product Offerings
 
Our simulator products include the following:
 

● | V-300™ Simulator – a 300° wrap-around screen with video capability is the higher standard for simulation training

Operations and Suppliers
 
We produce some of our own products. We also rely on a variety of suppliers. Management is uncertain whether we might encounter future delays with suppliers that would have a material impact on us.
Competition and Competitive Landscape
 
We compete against a number of established companies that provide similar products and services, some of which have financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours. There are also companies whose products do not compete directly but are sometimes closely related to the products we offer. Axon, Laser Shot, Inc., InVeris, MILO, and Ti Training Corp are our main competitors in some or all our markets.
 
We believe that our products and services are superior to those offered by our competitors based on our association with industry experts, the strength in developing a more effective training solution ecosystem, our patented products and our extensive library of training content that would require time and a substantial investment by a competitor to offer a comparable product.
 
VirTra buys and tests new headsets on a regular basis and has made some software and content preparations to add a headset-based product to our offerings. VirTra recoil kits, return fire devices and other accessories would likely also work with a headset-based product.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own or have rights to trademarks or trade names that we use in connection with the operation of our business, including our corporate names, logos and website names. In addition, we own or have the rights to copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary rights that protect the content of our products and the formulations for such products. This Annual Report on Form 10-K may also contain trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies, which are the property of their respective owners. Our use or display of third parties’ trademarks, service marks, trade names or products in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not intended to, and should not be read to, imply a relationship with or endorsement or sponsorship of us. Solely for convenience, some of the copyrights, trade names and trademarks referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are listed without their ©, ® and ™ symbols, but we will assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights to our copyrights, trade names and trademarks. All other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.
 
We rely on certain proprietary technology and seek to protect our interests through a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and security measures, including confidentiality agreements. Our policy generally is to secure protection for significant innovations to the fullest extent practicable. Further, we seek to expand and improve the technological base and individual features of our products through ongoing research and development programs.
 
Our patent portfolio includes seven issued U.S. patents, which expire between 2025 and 2037. In 2019, VirTra completed an Asset Purchase Agreement with Tiberius Technology, LLC, that included purchase of a patent and two pending patents, all patent ownership was transferred effective March 13, 2019, and the two pending patents were issued as patents. In 2022, we submitted patent applications that will remain confidential until awarded or will remain confidential if not awarded or abandoned.

We own the trademarks for “VirTra,” “VirTra Systems”, “Threat-Fire”, “ArmorGen” and many other branding trademarks. These trademarks are registered in the United States. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.
 
We also have copyright protection for our intellectual property produced for use in our products.
 
We rely on the laws of unfair competition and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other security measures. However, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. Effective trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services to the same extent as in the United States. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm or even destroy our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively. Further, enforcing our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and may not prove successful. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful.
 
Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, our research and product development expenses were $2,606,840 and $1,865,880, respectively.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials/Manufacturing and Assembly
 
We obtain the key components of our products from a variety of sources that we purchase on a purchase order basis from local suppliers at market prices based on our production requirements. We believe alternative sources generally exist for the components used in our products.
 
Our manufacturing, assembly, warehouse and shipping facilities are located in Chandler, Arizona. See “—Business – Property.”
 
Employees
 
As of March 10, 2023, we employed 121 full-time employees. We maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees
 
Operations
 
Our operations are conducted from our principal executive office in Chandler, Arizona. In 2022 we opened a facility in Orlando Fl to support east coast operations. We do not currently have any employees internationally; however, our U.S.-based sales force works to secure contracts to supply our products in U.S. and foreign markets. As of December 31, 2022, we have performed sales contracts and warranty service obligations in the U.S. and various foreign countries. When our products are introduced into an international market, it is either pursuant to a contract directly with a customer located in the foreign country, or pursuant to a contract between our company and a U.S. government agency (such as the U.S. Department of State). In the latter instance, our customer is the relevant U.S. government agency. The government agency may then distribute our products to third parties within the particular country.
Regulatory Matters
 
Our business is regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including, but not limited to, branches of the U.S. military and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets.
 
We are also subject to export laws and regulations. These laws include, among others, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the “ITAR”), administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, and trade sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control. Among its many provisions, the ITAR requires a license application for the export of firearms and congressional approval for any application with a total value of $1 million or higher.

Any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties. Any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products. The length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Any restrictions on the export of our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.
 
For additional information related to export regulations, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business.”
 
Government Contracts
 
The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default, based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. For additional information related to government contracts, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business.”
Environmental
 
We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.
