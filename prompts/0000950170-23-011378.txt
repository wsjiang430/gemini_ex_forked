ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. discovers, validates and develops high-value seafloor mineral resources in an environmentally responsible manner, providing access to critical resources that can transform societies and economies for generations to come.
The company has a diversified mineral portfolio that includes projects controlled by us and other projects in which we are a minority owner and service provider. In addition, our team is continually working to add new projects to the portfolio by identifying potential new assets through a proprietary Global Prospectivity Program leading to the acquisition of appropriate rights. Our development focus is on projects that can meet stringent standards for environmental responsibility and sustainability while unlocking benefits for the host country. Environmental protection remains at the forefront of the strategic and tactical decision-making processes in all our work.
 Each project in the portfolio is advanced along a defined development path, decreasing risk and increasing value along the way. These steps may include, but are not limited to, verification and quantification of the mineral asset, collection of baseline environmental data essential for environmental permitting, environmental impact studies and reports, design and verification of extraction systems and definition and verification of commercial programs. Odyssey may elect to sell equity in individual projects to fund continued advancement of the project.
For nearly 30 years, we have deployed cutting-edge ocean technology and processes at depths up to 6,000 meters, under the direction of some of the industry’s most skilled and successful ocean exploration professionals, scientists, and environmental specialists.
Importance of Seabed Mineral Exploration
There is growing global demand for critical mineral resources to power the green economy, feed the world’s growing population and provide vital infrastructure. Land based deposits of cobalt, manganese, rare earth minerals, phosphorite, gold, silver, copper and zinc are being depleted. As the worldwide population continues to grow, it is necessary to explore additional and alternative sources of these much-needed materials.
Climate change and the global transition to a lower carbon economy presents opportunities for Odyssey given the increased demand for raw materials for the future green economy including those that will be required for renewable energy generation and storage. Furthermore, as the worldwide population continues to grow, it is necessary to explore additional and alternative sources of these much-needed materials.
Subsea mineral deposits can provide these critical resources with less social and environmental impact. We have the expertise and technology to find and access these deposits and to prepare the project for extraction in an economically feasible and environmentally sensitive way.
Benefits of Ocean Mineral Resource Development
Some of the benefits of ocean mineral resource development include:
•Infrastructure Expense: No site-specific infrastructure and generally low capital expenditures – ship-based extraction systems provide the ability to redeploy, repurpose or increase equipment productivity through cost/tonne or ship charter financing options.
 •Overburden: Little overburden to be removed in most proposed seafloor mining projects which contributes to operational efficiencies.
 •Flexibility: Extraction ships can move to different types of deposits/minerals to suit market conditions without infrastructure loss at minimal costs. 
 •Social Displacement: No people are displaced, no disruption of society or property. 
 •Environmental Impact: Seafloor mining can be done responsibly with limited biological impact and a manageable carbon footprint. No forested lands will be impacted, and freshwater systems are not affected. Seafloor dredging, aggregate and diamond mining have been carried out for many years in shallow waters around the world and with appropriate mitigation programs have posed minimal adverse impact to marine ecosystems. 
 •Shipping logistics are efficient as ore and materials are extracted and moved directly to bulk carriers, lowering the number of steps in the delivery process thus reducing costs.
 Considering the benefits of subsea mineral resource extraction, we are convinced that in the future, ocean mining will be the best practice for responsible provision of critical resources required worldwide. Odyssey is taking the lead in preparing for this future through the validation and development of environmentally and socially responsible seafloor mineral projects.
Mineral and Offshore Services
We provide specialized mineral exploration, project development and marine services to clients (subsidiary companies, other companies and/or governments). As our business is focused on the development of a diversified portfolio of subsea resources, we may elect to receive equity for the provision of our services on select mineral projects. We have an extensive history conducting deep-ocean projects down to 6,000 meters in depth including deep-ocean resource explorations, ship and airplane wreck explorations, archaeological recovery and conservation and insurance documentation and applying this experience and expertise to advance our project portfolio.
Operational Projects and Status
We focus on projects that can meet stringent standards for environmental responsibility while unlocking benefits for the host community and country.
Our subsea project portfolio contains multiple projects in various stages of development throughout the world and across different mineral resources. We are regularly adding new projects through the development of new deposits, acquisition of mineral rights/deposits and through a leveraged contracting model, which allows the company to earn equity in deep-sea mineral projects.
 With respect to mineral deposits, Subpart 1300 of Regulations S-K outlines the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ("SEC") basic mining disclosure policy and what information may be disclosed in public filings. The SEC has adopted amendments to the property disclosure requirements for mining registrants that must be complied with for the full fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021, See Item 2 Properties.
Although Odyssey has a variety of projects in various stages of development, only projects with material operational activity in the past 12 months are included below.
ExO Phosphate Project:
The "Exploraciones Oceánicas" Phosphate Project is a rich deposit of phosphate sands located 70-90 meters deep within Mexico’s Exclusive Economic Zone. This deposit contains a large amount of high-grade phosphate rock that can be extracted on a

financially attractive basis (essentially a standard dredging operation). The product will be attractive to Mexican and other world producers of fertilizers and can provide important benefits to Mexico’s agricultural development.
The deposit lies within an exclusive mining concession licensed to the Mexican company Exploraciones Oceánicas S. de R.L. de CV ("ExO"). Oceanica Resources, S. de R.L., a Panamanian company ("Oceanica") owns 99.99% of ExO, and Odyssey owns 56.29% of Oceanica through Odyssey Marine Enterprises, Ltd., a wholly owned Bahamian company ("Enterprises").
In 2012, ExO was granted a 50-year mining license by Mexico (extendable for another 50 years at ExO’s option) for the deposit that lies 25-40 km offshore in Baja California Sur.
We spent more than three years preparing an environmentally sustainable development plan with the assistance of experts in marine dredging and leading environmental scientists from around the world. Key features of the environmental plan included:
•No chemicals would be used in the dredging process or released into the sea.
 •A specialized return down pipe that exceeds international best practices to manage the return of dredged sands close to the seabed, limiting plume or impact to the water column and marine ecosystem (including primary production). 
 •The seabed would be restored after dredging in such a way as to promote rapid regeneration of seabed organisms in dredged areas. 
 •Ecotoxicology tests demonstrated that the dredging and return of sediment to the seabed would not have toxic effects on organisms. 
 •Sound propagation studies concluded that noise levels generated during dredging would be similar to whale-watching vessels, merchant ships and fisherman’s ships that already regularly transit this area, proving the system is not a threat to marine mammals.
 •Dredging limited to less than one square kilometre each year, which means the project would operate in only a tiny proportion of the concession area each year.
 •Proven turtle protection measures were incorporated, even though the deposit and the dredging activity are much deeper and colder than where turtles feed and live, making material harm to the species highly remote. 
 •There will be no material impact on local fisheries as fishermen have historically avoided the water column directly above the deposit due to the naturally low occurrence of fish there.
 •The project would not be visible from the shoreline and would not impact tourism or coastal activities.
 •Precautionary mitigation measures were incorporated into the development plan in line with best-practice global operational standards.
 •The technology proposed to recover the phosphate sands has been safely used in Mexican waters for over 20 years on more than 200 projects.
 Notwithstanding the factors stated above, in April 2016 the Mexican Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources ("SEMARNAT") unlawfully rejected the permit to move forward with the project.
ExO challenged the decision in Mexican Federal court and in March 2018, the Tribunal Federal de Justicia Administrativa ("TFJA"), an 11-judge panel, ruled unanimously that SEMARNAT denied the application in violation of Mexican law and ordered the agency to re-take its decision. Just prior to the change in administration later in 2018, SEMARNAT denied the permit a second time in defiance of the court. ExO is once again challenging the unlawful decision of the Peña Nieto administration before the TFJA. In addition, in April 2019, we filed a North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA") Claim against Mexico to protect our shareholders’ interests and significant investment in the project.
Our claim seeks compensation of over $2 billion on the basis that SEMARNAT’s wrongful repeated denial of authorization has destroyed the value of our investment in the country and is in violation of the following provisions of NAFTA:
•Article 1102. National Treatment. 
 •Article 1105. Minimum Standard of Treatment; and 
 •Article 1110. Expropriation and Compensation.


We filed our First Memorial in the NAFTA case in September 2020. It is supported by documentary evidence and 20 expert reports and witness statements. In summary, this evidence includes:
•MERITS: Testimony from independent environmental experts that the environmental impact of ExO’s phosphate project is minimal and readily mitigated by the mitigation measures proposed by ExO. Witnesses also testified that Mexico’s denial of environmental approval by the prior administration was politically motivated and not justified on environmental grounds, and that Mexico granted environmental permits to similar dredging projects in areas that are considered more environmentally sensitive than ExO’s project location. 
 •RESOURCE: An independent certified marine geologist testified as to the size and character of the resource.
 •OPERATIONAL VIABILITY: Engineering experts testified that the project uses established dredging and processing technology, and the project’s anticipated CAPEX and OPEX was reasonable.
 •VALUE: A phosphate market analyst testified that the project’s projected CAPEX and OPEX would make the project one of the lowest cost phosphate rock resources in the world, and damages experts testified the project would be commercially viable and profitable.
 Odyssey filed its First Memorial in the case on September 4, 2020. Mexico filed its Counter-Memorial on February 23, 2021. On June 29, 2021, we filed our reply to Mexico’s Counter-Memorial. Odyssey’s filings are available at www.odysseymarine.com/nafta. Mexico filed its Rejoinder on October 19, 2021. The procedural calendar and case filings are available on the ICSID website. The NAFTA Tribunal hearing took place in early 2022. In accordance with the procedural calendar, written post-hearing briefs were filed in September 2022. The evidentiary phase of the case is now closed and the Tribunal has begun its deliberations. Odyssey cannot predict the length of these deliberations or when a ruling will be issued, but we remain confident in the merits of our case.
CIC Project:
CIC Limited ("CIC"), is a deep-sea mineral exploration company. CIC is supported by a consortium of companies providing expertise and financial contributions in support of development of the project. Odyssey is a member of the consortium, which also includes Royal Boskalis Westminster.
In December 2021, the Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority’s ("SBMA") Licensing Panel announced that CIC met the qualification criteria for an exploration license. On February 23, 2022, the SMBA awarded CIC a five-year exploration license beginning June 2022. Offshore explorations and research commenced in the third quarter of 2022 with positive results in early sampling, testing of vessels and equipment, which informed requirements for viable operational functions as the basis for a longer term operation over the license period. The early operations also resulted in preliminary resource sampling which will ultimately accrue to the resource evaluation and regional environmental assessment when primary operations commence in 2023.
 Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we have earned and now hold approximately 14.32% of the current outstanding equity units of CIC issued in exchange for provision of services by the Company.
We have the ability to earn up to an aggregate of 20.0 million equity units over the next several calendar years, which represents an approximate 16.0% interest in CIC based on the currently outstanding equity units. This means we can earn approximately 2.1 million additional equity units in CIC under our current services agreement. We achieved our current equity position through the provision of services rendered to this venture (see Note 9 Investment in Unconsolidated Entity).
South American Phosphate Project:
Odyssey reached an exclusive agreement in early 2022 with BlueSea Minerals, Ltd. and BlueSea Minerals Brasil Ltda. (collectively, the "BlueSea Group") to create a new joint venture company (the "JV") in which Odyssey will own a 75% interest. The JV will have exclusive rights to 19 highly prospective phosphate areas in the Exclusive Economic Zone ("EEZ") of a South American country. Legacy data and desktop research indicate high-grade phosphate deposits in the concession areas.
 Pending execution of the definitive agreement, Odyssey will manage the overall South American Phosphate Project development and BlueSea Group will manage business operations in South America. A related party to BlueSea Group, SeaSeep, will provide marine operations services, supervised by Odyssey.


The 19 licenses to be developed by the JV include 366 square kilometres of seabed. The geological setting of these licenses is similar to the geology Odyssey identified off the coast of Mexico, which is now known as the ExO Phosphate deposit ("ExO Project"). The ExO deposit estimated 588 million tonnes of high-grade resource. The ExO project had extremely compelling economics that demonstrated that ExO could have been one of the lowest cost producers in the world. Phosphate prices have surged in recent months and the need for phosphate to combat world hunger continues to grow. It is anticipated that the South American deposits can be harvested with the standard and similar technology and engineering solutions already identified for the ExO Project, which will allow the phosphate to be recovered in an environmentally responsible manner without the addition of any chemicals into the sea.
 LIHIR Gold Project:
The exploration license for the Lihir Gold Project covers a subsea area that contains at least five prospective gold exploration targets in two different mineralization types: seamount-related epithermal and modern placer gold. Two subaqueous debris fields within the area are adjacent to the terrestrial Ladolam Gold Mine and are believed to have originated from the same volcanogenic source. The resource lies 500-2,000 meters deep in the Papua New Guinea Exclusive Economic Zone off the coast of Lihir Island, adjacent to the location of one of the world’s largest know terrestrial gold deposits. We have an 85.6% interest in Bismarck Mining Corporation, Ltd, the Papua New Guinea company that holds the exploration license for the project.
 Previous exploration expeditions in the license area, including a survey conducted by Odyssey, indicate it is highly prospective for commercially viable gold content.
In August 2021, Papua New Guinea ("PNG") issued a permit extension allowing Odyssey to continue with our exploration program. We have developed an exploration program for the Lihir Gold Project to validate and quantify the precious and base metal content of the prospective resource. The Company met with local regulatory authorities, specialists in local mining, environmental legal experts, and logistics support service companies in PNG to establish baseline business functions essential for a successful program to support upcoming marine exploration operations in the license area. This offshore work began in late 2021. Bismarck and Odyssey value the environment and respect the interests and people of Papua New Guinea and Lihir and are committed to transparent sharing of all environmental data collected during the exploration program.
Offshore survey and mapping operations commenced in December 2021 in the Papua New Guinea, Lihir license area and was completed earlier this year. This work produced a high-resolution acoustic terrain model of the seafloor in the area, as well as acquiring acoustic images of subseafloor sediments and lithology. This allowed characterization of the geologic setting of the area and essentially created a "snapshot" of the environment. These activities will help us to further characterize the value of this project and allow informed decision making on how to proceed with environmentally sensitive direct geologic sampling.
Odyssey’s multi-year exploration program will focus on robust environmental surveys and studies that will accrue to environmental permitting in compliance with PNG’s requirements as well as the development of an Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA"). During the exploration phase, steps to validate and quantify the precious and base metal content of the prospective resource will also be carried out. Once completed, if the data shows extraction can be carried out responsibly, Odyssey will apply for a Mining License.
Further development of this project is dependent on the characterization of any present resources during exploration and license approvals.
Legal and Political Issues
Odyssey works with several leading international maritime lawyers and policy experts to constantly monitor international legal initiatives that might affect our projects.
To the extent that we engage in mineral exploration or marine activities in the territorial, contiguous or exclusive economic zones of countries, we work to comply with verifiable applicable regulations and treaties.
We believe there will be increased interest in the recovery of subsea minerals throughout the oceans of the world. We are uniquely qualified to provide governments and international agencies with knowledge and skills to help manage these resources.
Related to mineral exploration, we evaluate the political climate and specific legal requirements of any areas in which we are working. We may partner with third parties who have unique industry experience in specific geographical areas to assist with navigation of the regulatory landscape.
Competition
We conduct mineral exploration on both shallow and deep-sea terrains. There are several companies that publicly identify themselves as engaged in aspects of deep-ocean mineral exploration or mining, including Deep Sea Mining Finance Limited ("DSMF" OTCM:"NUSMF"), Ocean Marine Minerals ("OML"), The Metals Company (NASDAQ:"TMC"), Global Sea Mineral Resources ("GSR"), and Chatham Rock Phosphate, Ltd. ("CRP.NZ"), as well as countries that are evaluating options to mine deep-ocean mineralized materials. As our mineral exploration business plan includes partnering with others in the industry, we view these entities as potential partners rather than pure competitors. As mineral rights are generally granted on an exclusive basis for a specific area or tenement, once licenses are granted, we do not anticipate any competitive intrusion on those areas. It is possible that one of these companies or some currently unknown group may secure licenses on an area desired by us or one of our partners; but since exploration work does not start until licenses are secured, we do not believe that competition from one or more of these entities, known or unknown, would materially affect our operating plan or alter our current business strategy. For offshore mineral exploration, there are providers of vessels and equipment that could be competitors or partners for certain projects. These companies generally service the oil, gas, wind and telecom industries with survey capabilities. We view these companies as potential strategic partners or services providers for our projects.
Cost of Environmental Compliance
With the exception of marine operations, our general business operations do not expose us to environmental risks or hazards. We carry insurance that provides a layer of protection in the event of an environmental exposure resulting from the operation of vessels we may utilize. The cost of such coverage is not material on an annual basis. Our seabed mineral business is currently in the exploration and validation phase and has thus not exposed us to any significant environmental risks or hazards, other than those which are standard to basic marine operations.

Human Capital Management
We believe our success has always been dependent on our team of professionals in various fields who are passionate about the ocean, discovery, and making a difference. Therefore, we invest in our people and cultivate a dynamic, engaging, safe and welcoming workplace that drives innovation, encourages collaboration, and helps our people thrive.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 14 full-time employees, most working from our corporate offices in Tampa, Florida. Additionally, we contract with specialized technicians to perform technical marine survey and recovery operations and from time to time hire subcontractors and consultants to perform specific services.
Recruitment, Retention and Development
 Odyssey has a long tenured team which continues to grow and attract world class experts. We believe this is a testament to our culture of treating our employees with respect, providing them with the tools and setting to be productive and innovative, and providing benefits that allow employees to maintain a healthy home and work life. To foster their and our success, we have made the recruitment, retention and development of dedicated and experienced professionals a cornerstone of our corporate strategy.
Well-being
 Odyssey strives to support our employees in various ways and provide compensation and benefits that reflect our vested interest in them and their families. We offer generous health, dental and vision insurance coverage, company funded Health Reimbursement Accounts, as well as zero cost short-term, long-term and life insurance coverage for all employees. We recognize that our team’s needs are varied and changing and that our benefits should be as well. Our Beyond Benefits program provides other, non-traditional assistance to employees.
Training and Development
 A key contributing factor to our high employee retention rates is our ability to rescale and upscale them through internal and external training and development programs. These include seminars, educational courses and webinars, degree programs, professional organization memberships, scholarly journal subscriptions, books and computer-based resources.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 Our ability to retain and recruit employees with diverse backgrounds and perspectives is critical to driving innovation and to adapting to future challenges. As we grow our employee base and expand our work in other countries with diverse local communities, we strive to foster an inclusive company culture through increased training and awareness programs such as cultural sensitivity.
To date, our primary focus has been on gender diversity. Currently, 14% of our Board of Directors, 25% of our Executive team and 50% of our employees below executive level are female.
Enhancing gender and racial/ethnic diversity in management and our broader workforce is among Odyssey’s priorities for the coming years. When recruiting for senior leadership roles, we aspire to have at least 50% of candidates represent diverse backgrounds.
Health and Safety
 Odyssey is committed to maintaining an incident-free, healthy work environment for employees and contractors. Our focus on responsible seafloor exploration includes adhering to international best practices in occupational health and safety. We require that any contracted vessel, ship management agency, ship company, and staffed crew to be in good standing with various national, international and trade association codes.
 To measure progress towards our safety goals outlined in our Quality, Health, Safety and Environment policies and procedures, we track several key performance indicators (KPIs) including recordable medical incidents, lost workdays, first aid cases, restricted workdays, and frequency of safety meetings. Additional risk control measures include safety drills and management visits. KPIs and control measures continue to evolve as organization and project requirements change.
Internet Access
Odyssey’s Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available without charge through Odyssey’s web site on the Internet as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, www.sec.gov. They may be accessed as follows: www.odysseymarine.com (Investors/Financial Information Link).
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating our company and our business. Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks. The material risks are described below and should be carefully considered in evaluating Odyssey or any investment decision relating to our securities. This section is intended only as a summary of the principal risks. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, or financial results could suffer. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock.
Our business involves a high degree of risk.
An investment in Odyssey is extremely speculative and of exceptionally high risk. With respect to mineral exploration projects, there are uncertainties with respect to the quality and quantity of the material and their economic feasibility, the price we can obtain for the sale of the deposit or the ore extracted from the deposit, the granting of the necessary permits to operate, environmental safety, technology for extraction and processing, distribution of the eventual ore product, and funding of necessary equipment and facilities. In projects where Odyssey takes a minority ownership position in the company holding the mining rights, there may be uncertainty as to that company’s ability to move the project forward.
The research and data we use may not be reliable.
The success of a mineral project is dependent to a substantial degree upon the research and data we or the contracting party have obtained. By its very nature, research and data regarding mineral deposits can be imprecise, incomplete, outdated, and unreliable. For mineral exploration, data is collected based on a sampling technique and available data may not be representative of the entire ore body or tenement area. Prior to conducting off-shore exploration, we typically conduct on-shore research. There is no guarantee that the models and research conducted onshore will be representative of actual results on the seafloor. Offshore exploration typically requires significant expenditures, with no guarantee that the results will be useful or financially rewarding.
Operations may be affected by natural hazards.
Underwater exploration and recovery operations are inherently difficult and dangerous and may be delayed or suspended by weather, sea conditions or other natural hazards. Further, such operations may be undertaken more safely during certain months of the year than others. We cannot guarantee that we, or the entities we are affiliated with, will be able to conduct exploration, sampling or extractions operations during favorable periods. In addition, even though sea conditions in a particular search location may be somewhat predictable, the possibility exists that unexpected conditions may occur that adversely affect our operations. It is also possible that natural hazards may prevent or significantly delay operations. Seabed mineral extraction work may be subject to interruptions resulting from storms that adversely affect the extraction operations or the ports of delivery. Project planning considers these risks.
We may be unable to establish our rights to resources or items we discover or recover.
We may discover potentially valuable seabed mineral deposits, but we may be unable to get title to the deposits or get the necessary governmental permits to commercially extract the minerals. Mineral deposits may be in controlled waters where the policies

and laws of a certain government may change abruptly, thereby adversely affecting our ability to operate in those zones. We have a process for evaluating this risk in our proprietary Global Prospectivity Program.
The market for any objects or minerals we recover is uncertain.
During the time between when a mineral deposit is discovered and the first extracted minerals are sold, world and local prices for the mineral may fluctuate drastically and thereby adversely affect the economics of the mineral project.
We could experience delays in the disposition or sale of minerals or recovered objects.
It may take significant time between when a mineral deposit is discovered and the first extracted minerals are sold. Stakes in the mineral deposits can potentially be sold at an earlier date, but there is no guarantee that there will be readily available buyers at favorable competitive prices.
Legal, political or civil issues could interfere with our marine operations.
Legal, political or civil issues of governments throughout the world could restrict access to our operational marine sites or interfere with our marine operations or rights to seabed mineral deposits. In many countries, the legislation covering ocean exploration lacks clarity or certainty. As a result, when we are conducting projects in certain areas of the world for our own account or on our behalf of a contracting party, we may be subjected to unexpected delays, requests, and outcomes as we work with local governments to define and obtain the necessary permits and to assert our claims over assets on the seafloor bottom. Our vessel, equipment, personnel and or cargo could be seized or detained by government authorities. We may have to work with different units of a government, and there may be a change of government representatives over time. This may result in unexpected changes or interpretations in government contracts and legislation.
We may be unable to get permission to conduct exploration, excavation, or extraction operations.
It is possible we will not be successful in obtaining the necessary permits to conduct exploration or excavation and extraction operations. In addition, permits we obtain may be revoked or not honored by the entities that issued them. In addition, certain governments may develop new permit requirements that could delay new operations or interrupt existing operations.
Changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses.
As changes in our business environment occur, we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. When these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets or sell certain assets. In any of these events our costs may increase, and we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets. Discontinuing the use of a multi-year charter of a ship may result in large one-time costs to cover any penalties or charges to put the ship back into its original condition.
 We may be unsuccessful in raising the necessary capital to fund operations and capital expenditures.
Our ability to generate cash inflows is dependent upon our ability to provide mineral exploration and development services to our subsidiaries and other subsea mineral companies or monetize mineral rights. However, we cannot guarantee that the sales and other cash sources will generate sufficient cash inflows to meet our overall cash requirements. If cash inflows are not sufficient to meet our business requirements, we will be required to raise additional capital through other financing activities. While we have been successful in raising the necessary funds in the past, there can be no assurance we can continue to do so in the future.
We depend on key employees and face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.
Our employees are vital to our success, and our key management and other employees are difficult to replace. We currently do not have employment contracts with the majority of our key employees. We may not be able to retain highly qualified employees in the future which could adversely affect our business.

We may continue to experience significant losses from operations.
We have experienced a net loss in every fiscal year since our inception except for 2004. Our net losses were $23.1 million in 2022, $10.0 million in 2021 and $14.8 million in 2020. Even if we do generate operating income in one or more quarters in the future, subsequent developments in our industry, customer base, business or cost structure or an event such as significant litigation or a significant transaction may cause us to again experience operating losses. We may not become profitable for the long-term, or even for any quarter.
Technological obsolescence of our marine assets or failure of critical equipment could put a strain on our capital requirements or operational capabilities.
We employ state-of-the-art technology including side-scan sonar, magnetometers, ROVs, and other advanced science and technology to perform seabed mineral exploration. Although we try to maintain back-ups on critical equipment and components, equipment failures may require us to delay or suspend operations. Also, while we endeavor to keep marine equipment in excellent working condition and current with all available upgrades, technological advances in new equipment may provide superior efficiencies compared to the capabilities of our existing equipment, and this could require us to purchase new equipment which would require additional capital.
We may not be able to contract with clients or customers for marine services or syndicated projects.
In the past, from time to time, we have earned revenue by chartering out vessels, equipment and crew and providing marine services to clients or customers. Even if we do contract out our services, the revenue may not be sufficient to cover administrative overhead costs. While the operational results of these syndicated projects are generally successful, the clients or customers may not be willing or financially able to continue with syndicated projects of this type in the future. Failure to secure such revenue producing contracts in the future may have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating cash flows. We may take payment for these services in the form of cash, equity in the client’s company, or a financial interest in the tenement areas.
The issuance of shares at conversion prices lower than the market price at the time of conversion and the sale of such shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
Some of our outstanding shares may have been acquired from time to time upon conversion of convertible notes at conversion prices that are lower than the market price of our common stock at the time of conversion. In the past, Odyssey has issued debt obligations that could be converted into common shares at prices below the current market price. Conversion of the notes at conversion prices that are lower than the market price at the time of conversion and the sale of the shares issued upon conversion could have an adverse effect upon the market price of our common stock.
 Investments in subsea mineral exploration companies may prove unsuccessful.
We have invested in marine mineral companies that to date are still in the exploration phase and have not begun to earn revenue from operations. We may or may not have control or input on the future development of these businesses. There can be no assurance that these companies will achieve profitability or otherwise be successful in capitalizing on the mineralized materials they intend to exploit.
 We may be subject to short selling strategies.
Short sellers of our stock may be manipulative and may attempt to drive down the market price of our common stock. Short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has, supposedly, borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller’s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers (sometime known as "disclosed shorts") publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. Although traditionally these disclosed shorts were limited in their ability to access mainstream business media or to otherwise create negative market rumors, the rise of the Internet and technological advancements regarding document creation, videotaping and publication by weblog ("blogging") have allowed many disclosed shorts to publicly attack a company’s credibility, strategy and veracity by means of so-called "research reports" that mimic the type of investment analysis performed by large Wall Street firms and independent research analysts. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market, on occasion in large scale and broad base. Issuers who have limited trading volumes and are susceptible to higher volatility levels than large-cap stocks, can

be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. These short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental, self-regulatory organization or other official authority in the U.S., are not subject to certification requirements imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and, accordingly, the opinions they express may be based on distortions or omissions of actual facts or, in some cases, fabrications of facts. In light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information, and the enormous profit that can be made from running just one successful short attack, unless the short sellers become subject to significant penalties, it is more likely than not that disclosed short sellers will continue to issue such reports.
Some of our equipment or assets could be seized or we may be forced to sell certain assets.
We have pledged certain assets, such as equipment and shares of subsidiaries, as collateral under our loan agreements. Some suppliers have the ability to seize some of our assets if we do not make timely payments for the services, supplies, or equipment that they have provided to us. If we were unable to make payments on these obligations, the lender or supplier may seize the asset or force the sale of the asset. The loss of such assets could adversely affect our operations. The sale of the asset may be done in a manner and under circumstances that do not provide the highest cash value for the sale of the asset.
We could be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market.
Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, which imposes, among other requirements, a minimum bid requirement. The closing bid price for our common stock must remain at or above $1.00 per share to comply with NASDAQ’s minimum bid requirement for continued listing. If the closing bid price for our common stock is less than $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, NASDAQ may send us a notice stating we will be provided a period of 180 days to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement or else NASDAQ may make a determination to delist our common stock. Another requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market is to maintain our market capitalization above $35.0 million.
Our failure to maintain compliance with the above-mentioned and other NASDAQ continued listing requirements may lead to the delisting of our common from the NASDAQ Capital Market. Delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. If our common stock is delisted by NASDAQ, our common stock may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter quotation system, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. We cannot assure you that our common stock, if delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the counter quotation system.
Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our business risks.
 Although we seek to obtain insurance for some of our main operational risks, there is no guarantee that the insurance policies that we have are sufficient, that they will be in place when needed, that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage when desired, that insurance will be available on commercially attractive terms, or that we will be able to anticipate the risks that need to be insured. For example, although we may be able to obtain War Risk coverage for a project at a specific date and location, such insurance may be unavailable at other times and locations. Although we may be able to insure our marine assets for certain risks such as certain possible loss or damage scenarios, we may lack insurance to cover against government seizure or detention of our certain marine assets. Permanent loss or temporary loss of our marine assets and the associated business interruption without commensurate compensation from an insurance policy could severely impact the financial results and operational capabilities of the company.
We may be exposed to cyber security risks.
We depend on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and among ourselves within our company. Additionally, one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of our employees. Our information systems, and those of our service and support providers, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Computer viruses, hackers and other external hazards, as well as improper or inadvertent staff behavior could expose confidential company and personal data systems and information to security breaches. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or cause system interruption change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these incidents or techniques, timely discover them, or implement adequate preventative measures. With respect to our commercial arrangements with service and support providers, we have processes designed to require third-party IT outsourcing, offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information. However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a vendor’s employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes, or a cyber-attack on a vendor’s information systems or our information systems.


Mining exploration, development and operating have inherent risks.
Mining operations generally involve a high degree of risk. The financing, exploration, development and mining of any of our properties is furthermore subject to a number of macroeconomic, legal and social factors, including commodity prices, laws and regulations, political conditions, currency fluctuations, the ability to hire and retain qualified people, the inability to obtain suitable and adequate machinery, equipment or labor and obtaining necessary services in the jurisdictions in which we may operate. Unfavorable changes to these and other factors have the potential to negatively affect our operations and business. Major expenses may be required to locate and establish mineral reserves and resources, to develop processes and to construct mining and processing facilities at a particular site. Mining, processing, development and exploration activities depend, to one degree or another, on adequate infrastructure. Unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, sabotage, government or other interference could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations. It is impossible to ensure that the exploration or development programs planned by us will result in a profitable commercial mining operation. Whether precious or base metal or mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, some of which are: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as the quantity and quality of mineralization ; mineral prices, which are highly cyclical; and government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting minerals and environmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. There is no certainty that the expenditures to be made by us towards the exploration and evaluation of our projects will result in discoveries or production of commercial quantities of the minerals. In addition, once in production, mineral reserves are finite and there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate additional reserves as its existing reserves are depleted.
We are subject to significant governmental regulations, which affect our operations and costs of conducting our business.
Our exploration operations are subject to government legislation, policies and controls relating to prospecting, development, production, environmental protection, mining taxes and labor standards. In order for us to carry out our activities, various licenses and permits must be obtained and kept current. There is no guarantee that the Company’s licenses and permits will be granted, or that once granted will be maintained and extended. In addition, the terms and conditions of such licenses or permits could be changed and there can be no assurances that any application to renew any existing licenses will be approved. There can be no assurance that all permits that we require will be obtainable on reasonable terms, or at all. Delays or a failure to obtain such permits, or a failure to comply with the terms of any such permits that we have obtained, could have a material adverse impact on our operations. We may be required to contribute to the cost of providing the required infrastructure to facilitate the development of our properties and will also have to obtain and comply with permits and licenses that may contain specific conditions concerning operating procedures, water use, waste disposal, spills, environmental studies and financial assurances. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with any such conditions and non-compliance with such conditions may result in the loss of certain of our permits and licenses on properties, which may have a material adverse effect on us. Future taxation of mining operators cannot be predicted with certainty so planning must be undertaken using present conditions and best estimates of any potential future changes. There is no certainty that such planning will be effective to mitigate adverse consequences of future taxation on us.
We may not be able to obtain all required permits and licenses to place any of our properties into production.
Our current and future operations, including development activities and commencement of production, if warranted, require permits from governmental authorities and such operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations governing prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, environmental protection, mine safety and other matters. Companies engaged in mineral property exploration and the development or operation of mines and related facilities generally experience increased costs, and delays in production and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits. We cannot predict if all permits which we may require for continued exploration, development or construction of mining facilities and conduct of mining operations will be obtainable on reasonable terms, if at all. Costs related to applying for and obtaining permits and licenses may be prohibitive and could delay our planned exploration and development activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial actions. Parties engaged in mining operations may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of mining companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cause increases in capital expenditures or production costs or reduction in levels of production at producing properties or require abandonment or delays in development of new mining properties

Calculations of mineral resources and mineral reserves are estimates only and subject to uncertainty.
The estimating of mineral resources and mineral reserves is an imprecise process and the accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, the assumptions used and judgments made in interpreting engineering and geological information and estimating future capital and operating costs. There is significant uncertainty in any reserve or resource estimate, and the economic results of mining a mineral deposit may differ materially from the estimates as additional data are developed or interpretations change.
Estimated mineral resources and mineral reserves may be materially affected by other factors.
In addition to uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral resources and mineral reserves, other factors may adversely affect estimated mineral resources and mineral reserves. Such factors may include but are not limited to metallurgical, environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political, gold prices, and capital and operating costs. Any of these or other adverse factors may reduce or eliminate estimated mineral reserves and mineral resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and corporate reputation.
