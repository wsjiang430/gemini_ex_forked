Business Description 
 Quantum, founded in 1980 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1987, is a leader in storing and managing video and video-like data. We deliver top streaming performance for video and rich media applications, along with low cost, high density massive-scale data protection and archive systems. We help customers capture, create and share digital data and preserve and protect it for decades. Our software-defined storage solutions span from non-volatile memory express (NVMe), to solid state drives (SSD), hard disk drives (HDD), tape and the cloud and are tied together leveraging a single view of the entire data environment. Our software-defined approach to storage management that combines storage, compute, and virtualization in one physical unit is broadly known in our industry as an example of hyperconverged storage. We work closely with a broad network of distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), direct marketing resellers (DMRs), original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and other suppliers to meet customers evolving needs. The worlds leading entertainment companies, sports franchises, researchers, government agencies, enterprises, and cloud providers make the world happier, safer, and smarter on our systems. 
 Our high-performance shared storage systems enable accelerated and collaborative access to critical data. Powered by our StorNext software, our systems provide high performance and availability to enable movie and TV production, analysis of patient records, analysis of video and image data for government and military applications, and more. We sell our StorNext software with hyperconverged storage infrastructures that are built using a combination of NVMe, SSD, HDD, tape, and cloud storage technologies. We have recently refreshed this entire product line, and introduced the Quantum F-Series, an ultra-fast, highly available NVMe storage array for editing, rendering, and processing of video content and other large unstructured data sets. 
 Our tape storage provides low cost, long-term data storage for archiving and retention, as well as offline storage to protect against ransomware. Tape storage is a critical technology for long-term off-line storage of data, both in the cloud and on-premise, and is a critical component of enterprise data protection strategies. We continue to be a market leader in tape storage utilizing industry-leading performance, reliability, scalability, and manageability. 
 We also recently released the Quantum VS-Series and Quantum R-Series. The Quantum VS-Series is a hyperconverged platform designed for surveillance and industrial applications for the Internet of Things, (IoT), and enables security and facilities departments to efficiently record and store surveillance footage and run an entire security infrastructure on a single, software-defined platform. Our Quantum R-Series is removable storage

  designed to capture data in vehicles where the storage device must be more rugged. We describe the Quantum R-Series as ruggedized to emphasize the additional physical protection we build into the product so that it operates as intended in the air, on the road, on rails, and in battlefield environments. The Quantum R-Series addresses use cases such as the development of advanced driver-assistance systems, (ADAS), and mobile military and surveillance applications. This product can capture data in real world environments, and then makes this data quickly available for processing and use. 
 We are a member of the consortium that develops, patents, and licenses Linear Tape-Open, (or LTO® tape) technology to media manufacturing companies. We receive royalty payments for LTO media technology sold under licensing agreements. We have also entered into various licensing agreements with respect to our technology, patents and similar intellectual property which provide licensing revenues in certain cases and may expand the market for products and solutions using these technologies. 
 We are focused on driving profitable revenue growth and long-term shareholder value by capitalizing on the growth in video and high-resolution image data across industries and verticals. 
 Industry Background 
 For the markets and customers that we serve, storing and managing large amounts of video, image and sensor data has become a key challenge. Video and other imaging data is becoming increasingly prevalent in every industry. Some examples of this ever-growing trend include: 

 | The media and entertainment industry producing more high-resolution content for movies and TV shows;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Large corporations producing video content for marketing and advertising, and for internal training and communication purposes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Surveillance cameras for city surveillance, critical infrastructure, higher education, retail, restaurants, and more;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Military and defense applications that manage images and video from drones and satellites;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | High-resolution MRI images and genome sequencing data generated by medical research institutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Video, image, and sensor data captured on the manufacturing floor;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Video, image, and sensor data produced by cars as part of ADAS and autonomous vehicle development.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This video and imaging data is growing exponentially, and in the next few years, this video data will represent the vast majority of the data on the planet. This class of data presents a unique set of challenges for our customers. These datasets are exponentially larger than the average corporate database, they are costly and technically difficult to store and process in the cloud, and many of the data services designed for databases and other corporate applications do not work with this data. Video and image data is very difficult to search, and yet it is the data that has the most value to the business lines of many of our customers. This presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Lastly, these datasets typically have a lifecycle that initially requires very high performance for creation, intake, cataloging, analysis and collaboration, and then needs to be archived and protected for decades at a low cost. Our products have been designed to address these needs.

In addition, we utilize various other third-party service providers throughout the world to perform repair and warranty services for us to reach additional geographic areas and industries in order to provide quality services in a cost-effective manner. 
 Research and Development 
 We compete in an industry characterized by rapid technological change and evolving customer requirements. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to introduce new products and features to meet end user needs. Our research and development teams are focused on technology and services to make our storage systems smarter and easier to manage at scale; software enhancements to make our storage more searchable and accessible, software-defined hyperconverged storage technology, next generation solid-state and hard-drive storage system software, data deduplication and other data reduction technologies, and making tape even more efficient as a storage medium for long term archival storage. 
 We continue to invest in research and development to improve and expand our product lines and introduce new product lines such as the Quantum F-Series, Quantum VS-Series and Quantum R-Series. Our research and development costs were $32.1 million, $38.6 million, and $44.4 million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 Sales and Distribution Channels 
 Quantum Product Sales Channels 
 For our products, we utilize distributors, VARs and DMRs. Our integrated reseller program provides our channel partners the option of purchasing products directly or through distribution channels and provides them access to a more comprehensive product line. Additionally, we sell directly to a number of large corporate entities and government agencies. 
 OEM Relationships 
 We sell our products to several OEM customers that resell our hardware products under their own brand names and typically assume responsibility for product sales, end user service and support. We also license our software to certain OEM customers that include this software in their own brand name products. These OEM relationships enable us to reach end users not served by our branded distribution channels or our direct sales force. They also allow us to sell to select geographic or vertical markets where specific OEMs have exceptional strength. 
 Customers 
 Our sales are typically concentrated with several key customers, as we sell to OEMs, distributors, VARs and DMRs to reach end user customers. Sales to our top five customers represented 33%, 29%, 28% revenue in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 no customers represented 10% or more of the Companys total revenue.

 Competition 
 The markets in which we participate are highly competitive, characterized by rapid technological change and changing customer requirements. In some cases, our competitors in one market area are customers or suppliers in another. Our competitors often have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing or other resources than we do. Additionally, the competitive landscape continues to change due to merger and acquisition activity as well as new entrants into the market. 
 Our high-performance shared storage systems primarily face competition from the EMC business unit of Dell Inc., (Dell), International Business Machines Corporation, (IBM), NetApp, Inc., (NetApp), and other content storage vendors in the media and entertainment industry as well as government agencies and departments. 
 Our tape storage primarily compete in the midrange and enterprise reseller and end user markets with IBM, Oracle Corporation and SpectraLogic Corporation as well as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company, (HPE), through its OEM relationship with other tape system suppliers. Competitors for entry-level and OEM tape systems include BDT Products, Inc. and several others that supply or manufacture similar products. In addition, disk backup products and cloud storage are an indirect competitive alternative to tape storage. 
 Our backup storage systems primarily compete with products sold by Dell, HPE and Veritas Technologies LLC. Additionally, several software companies that have traditionally been partners with us have deduplication features in their products and will, at times, compete with us. A number of our competitors also license technology from other competing companies. 
 For standalone LTO tape drives, our main competitor is IBM, which develops and sells its own LTO tape drives. We also face competition from disk alternatives, including removable disk drives in the entry-level market. 
 Manufacturing and Supply Chain 
 We are in the process of transitioning our supply chain and manufacturing operations to deliver a variable cost model while improving customer delivered quality and service. This process includes the transition to a multi-geographical manufacturing model using a configure-to-order methodology; a redesign of our service and supplier network; and talent acquisition and development. Our supply chain and manufacturing strategy minimizes geo- political and environmental causal risks and provides flexibility to support demand fluctuations by region, further enhancing our variable cost structure. 
 Manufacturing of our tape systems is performed in the U.S. and Mexico with supporting third-party logistics companies in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, or (EMEA), and the Asia-Pacific region, or (APAC). Our backup storage systems are integrated in the U.S. with supporting third-party logistics companies in EMEA and APAC. The value of utilizing well-run logistics companies and supply chain solutions is that our product logistics is optimized for cost reductions with a competitive advantage allowing the physical flow and information flow to work together seamlessly. 
 Our tape media is manufactured in Japan and distributed globally.

 Intellectual Property and Technology 
 We generally rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products. As of March 31, 2019, we hold approximately 332 U.S. patents and have 46 pending U.S. patent applications. In general, these patents have a 20-year term from the first effective filing date for each patent. We also hold a number of foreign patents and patent applications for certain of our products and technologies. Although we believe that our patents and applications have significant value, rapidly changing technology in our industry means that our future success may also depend heavily on the technical competence and creative skills of our employees. 
 From time to time, third parties have asserted that the manufacture and sale of our products have infringed on their patents. We are not knowingly infringing any third-party patents. Should it ultimately be determined that licenses for third-party patents are required, we will undertake best efforts to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings for additional disclosures regarding lawsuits alleging patent infringement. 
 On occasion, we have entered into various patent licensing and cross-licensing agreements with other companies. We may enter into patent cross-licensing agreements with other third parties in the future as part of our normal business activities. These agreements, when and if entered into, would enable these third parties to use certain patents that we own and enable us to use certain patents owned by these third parties. We have also sold certain patents, retaining a royalty-free license for these patents. 
 We, along with HPE and IBM, belong to the LTO Consortium, an organization that licenses the Consortium members patents covering the LTO specifications. Media manufacturers and other parties take licenses to the LTO Consortium patent pool in exchange for a royalty payment to the Consortium, which then distributes the royalties to each of the three Consortium members. More details regarding the Consortium and participants in the licensing arrangements available to manufacturers and other parties are available at www.lto.org.
Segment Information 
 We operate as a single reporting unit and operating segment for business and operating purposes. Information about revenue attributable to each of our product groups is included in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and information about revenue and long-lived assets attributable to certain geographic regions is included in Note 15 Geographic Information to the consolidated financial statements and risks attendant to our foreign operations is set forth below in Item 1A Risk Factors.Seasonality 
 As is typical in our industry, we generally have the greatest demand for our products and services in the fourth quarter of each calendar year, or our fiscal third quarter. We usually experience the lowest demand for our products and services in the first and second quarters of each calendar year, or our fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal first quarter, respectively. 
Backlog 
 We believe that product backlog has not been a meaningful indicator of net revenue that can be expected for any period. Our products are manufactured based on forecasts of customer demand and we work with our manufacturers and suppliers to support increases and decreases in demand. Orders are generally placed by customers on an as-needed basis. Product orders are confirmed and, in most cases, shipped to customers within four to six weeks. More complex systems and product configurations often have longer lead times, sometimes as much as 26 weeks. The majority of the product backlog is from these more complex systems and typically increases at the end of each fiscal quarter, with these products typically being shipped in the following quarter. Product backlog at any point in time may not translate into net revenue in any subsequent period, as unfilled orders can generally be canceled at any time by the customer.
