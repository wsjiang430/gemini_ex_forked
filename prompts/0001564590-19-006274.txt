Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on creating innovative cancer immunotherapies by leveraging underexploited biological opportunities. Specifically, we target well-characterized biological pathways with significant scientific data supporting their importance in regulating the immune response against cancer and for which either there are no molecules in development or those that exist have suboptimal profiles. To exploit these pathways, we have built a robust and highly efficient discovery capability to create and optimize highly differentiated small-molecule immuno-oncology product candidates. Since our inception in 2015, we have built a broad portfolio of small-molecule and antibody product candidates that we plan to develop together as intra-portfolio combinations. 
 Our most advanced small-molecule product candidate, AB928, is in a Phase 1/1b program to evaluate it in combination with chemotherapy and with our anti-PD-1 antibody, AB122.  We expect to report dose-escalation data for certain of these combinations and initiate dose-expansion studies in 2019.  We have also initiated clinical trials for our two antibody product candidates, AB122 and AB154 (our anti-TIGIT antibody) and advanced our fourth product candidate, AB680 (a small molecule CD73 inhibitor) into a clinical trial in healthy volunteers in 2018. 
 Our initial focus is on the ATP-adenosine pathway, a key driver of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Decades of scientific research have demonstrated that extracellular adenosine, generated by the CD73 enzyme, acts as a powerful inhibitor of immune cell activity. The compelling therapeutic rationale for inhibition of the ATP-adenosine pathway has led several companies to repurpose for oncology existing adenosine A2aR receptor antagonists that were originally designed for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) indications. We believe that our lead product candidate, AB928, which we designed using our small-molecule discovery capability, is the first adenosine receptor antagonist that effectively blocks the adenosine receptor in the tumor microenvironment and potently inhibits both the adenosine 2a receptor (A2aR) and the adenosine 2b receptor (A2bR). Our in vitro studies have demonstrated that AB928 reverses adenosine-induced immunosuppression and inhibits the A2aR and A2bR receptors more potently and effectively than the other adenosine receptor antagonists in clinical development. In addition to AB928, we have created a small-molecule inhibitor of CD73, AB680, which could represent another powerful approach to inhibiting the ATP-adenosine pathway and have generated additional potential product candidates against ATP-adenosine and other important immuno-oncology pathways using our internal discovery capability. 
 As the immuno-oncology market evolves toward the use of combination therapies, a key element of our strategy is to build a broad portfolio of product candidates that target a wide range of immune mechanisms, which will enable us to pursue multiple intra-portfolio combinations. Consistent with this strategy, we are developing antibody drug candidates that are currently considered the foundation for combination therapies in immuno-oncology, or backbone therapy, or that have the potential to be future backbone therapies, such as our in-licensed antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint receptors PD-1 and TIGIT. Our strategy is to create differentiated combination products by combining these antibodies with our internally discovered small-molecule product candidates.

Our Product Portfolio 
 The following chart summarizes our product pipeline. We currently hold world-wide rights to all of our product candidates other than the rights to AB122 in China and five other countries that are outside of the United States, Europe and Japan. In addition, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Taiho) has an option to exclusively license the development and commercialization rights to each of our programs for Japan and certain other territories in Asia (excluding China). 
 

TNBC: triple negative breast cancer; CRC: colorectal cancer; GE: gastroesophageal cancer; NSCLC: non-small cell lung cancer.
 We currently have four clinical-stage product candidates, the profiles of which are summarized below:
 
• | AB928. Our lead adenosine receptor antagonist, AB928, is an orally bioavailable, highly potent, reversible antagonist of the A2aR and A2bR receptors. We believe that AB928 is the first adenosine receptor antagonist in clinical development to be designed specifically for the biology of the tumor microenvironment and has multiple advantages over other adenosine receptor antagonists in clinical development, including: (i) significantly greater potency under conditions that closely resemble the tumor microenvironment, for example, high concentrations of adenosine and albumin, (ii) inhibition of both the A2aR and A2bR receptors, (iii) low penetration through the blood-brain barrier, (iv) high penetration of tumor tissue and (v) attractive pharmacokinetics, with high oral bioavailability and a human half-life that enables once-daily dosing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We completed a Phase 1 trial of AB928 in 85 healthy volunteers in 2018 (Seitz, L., Jin, L., Leleti, M. et al. Invest New Drugs (2018). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10637-018-0706-6). This trial provided us with significant insights into the safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of AB928, allowing us to initiate the dose-escalation portions of our combination trials in cancer patients at a pharmacologically relevant dose. We completed the single-ascending-dose and multiple-ascending-dose portions of the healthy volunteer trial, administering daily doses up to 150 mg and 200 mg, respectively, with both doses demonstrating at least 90% inhibition of A2aR activation. All adverse events were low-grade. 
 We started enrollment in cancer patients for AB928 in combination with AB122, our anti-PD-1 antibody, and in combination with chemotherapy in the second half of 2018. We are exploring AB928 in a variety of solid tumors supported by biological and commercial rationale, as described in more detail in “—Our Clinical Development Strategy for AB928.” We are also focused on the identification of additional molecules that block adenosine receptor signaling and have identified a selective A2aR antagonist (AB745), which is currently undergoing safety assessment in GLP toxicology studies, as well as progressing through CMC (chemistry, manufacturing and controls) development, with the goal of being IND-ready by the fourth quarter of 2019.

• | AB680. Our lead CD73 inhibitor, AB680, is a highly potent, reversible and selective inhibitor of the CD73 enzyme and we believe it is the first small-molecule inhibitor of CD73 to enter clinical development. As CD73 plays a critical role in the extracellular generation of adenosine, AB680 may provide a highly effective approach to preventing adenosine-mediated immune suppression. We initiated our first clinical trial for AB680 (intravenous infusion) in healthy volunteers in the second half of 2018. Similar to the AB928 clinical development plan, we plan to follow the healthy volunteer trial with trials that will explore AB680 in combination with other agents in solid tumors in which we believe that the ATP-adenosine pathway plays an important role. Based upon its pharmacokinetic profile in humans, AB680 has the potential to be administered on the same dosing schedule as our anti-PD-1 antibody, AB122, and various chemotherapeutic agents, which would be attractive from a patient compliance and commercial perspective. In the second half of 2018, we also advanced into preclinical development an oral formulation of AB680 and expect preclinical development to be completed in 2019.

• | AB122. Our anti-PD-1 antibody, AB122, is a fully human antibody with similar binding affinity and other characteristics to the marketed anti-PD-1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab. AB122 is currently completing a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial in cancer patients in Australia. Based on the data generated, we selected 240 mg every two weeks (Q2W) as the dosing regimen for AB122. We continue to evaluate different doses and dosing schedules and expect to report additional safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from this trial in 2019. We expect to initiate an expansion cohort to evaluate AB122 as a single agent in tumor types known to be responsive to an anti-PD-1 therapy in mid-2019. We are also developing AB122 in combination with our other small-molecule and antibody product candidates. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AB154. Our anti-TIGIT antibody, AB154, is a humanized antibody that inhibits a unique immune checkpoint target involved in a pathway that plays both inhibitory and stimulatory roles in the immune system. We initiated a Phase 1 dose escalation trial to evaluate AB154 as a single agent and in combination with AB122 in the third quarter of 2018. A variety of tumor types associated with high expression of CD155 and TIGIT will be explored in the dose-expansion portion of this ongoing trial.

 While we plan to retain significant economic and commercial rights to our portfolio, we may out-license the rights to our product candidates in certain regions where we are unlikely to pursue commercialization on our own. In 2017, we entered into an option and license agreement with Taiho for the potential development and commercialization of our product candidates in Japan and certain other territories in Asia (excluding China). Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive a non-refundable and non-creditable upfront payment and research payments totaling $35.0 million during the first three years of the agreement. For any program for which Taiho exercises its option for an exclusive license, we will receive an option payment and will be eligible to receive up to $275.0 million in development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments arising from such program, as well as royalties, ranging from high single digits to mid-teens, on net sales in Taiho’s territories.  Taiho exercised its rights to our adenosine receptor antagonist program, which includes AB928 and back-up compounds, in 2018. 
 Opportunities for Combination Therapies 
 Despite the success of the first generation of immune checkpoint inhibitors, patient response rates for single-agent therapy are relatively low. For example, the first two approved anti-PD-1 antibodies, when administered as single agents, have only demonstrated response rates of approximately 30% in melanoma patients, and the majority of these patients see their disease ultimately progress. In addition, these therapies have not demonstrated meaningful single-agent activity in many of the most prevalent types of cancer, such as breast, prostate, pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal.

To address the limitations of single-agent immuno-oncology therapy, efforts are now focused on combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies with other types of drugs. These combination efforts are designed to address the multiple mechanisms that likely prevent effective anti-tumor immunity and are based on the understanding that several immune processes may need to be modulated concurrently to overcome the adaptations that tumors use to escape immunity. For example, in addition to T cells, there are several other types of immune cells that are critical to an effective anti-tumor immune response, which can be dysregulated in cancer. In addition, tumors can affect their microenvironment in ways that suppress effective immune function, thereby creating favorable conditions for tumor growth and proliferation. 
 The first combination of immuno-oncology agents to be approved by the FDA was the combination of two immune checkpoint inhibitors, the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab and the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab, for the treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma. While this combination improved survival rates relative to either agent alone, it also resulted in increased toxicities. Regardless, this therapy demonstrates the opportunity for combinations of drugs that target multiple immune mechanisms. 
 A significant academic and industry effort is now underway to evaluate combinations of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies with other agents in order to achieve higher response rates and longer overall survival. Despite recent clinical successes with combination therapy, the challenge remains to identify and develop combinations that will ultimately succeed in important clinical settings. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to address this opportunity by pursuing mechanisms and combinations supported by strong biological rationale derived from existing and evolving scientific data sets. 
 Our Unique Approach to Immuno-Oncology 
 Our Focus on Scientifically Validated Immuno-Oncology Pathways 
 To exploit the significant opportunity in the immuno-oncology market in the most efficient manner and to maximize the addressable patient population for our portfolio, we focus on the following: 

• | Scientifically Validated Pathways. Academia has spent decades elucidating the biology behind the immune system’s role in cancer, generating a large amount of information on pathways and potential therapeutic targets. However, much of this information has yet to be translated into the discovery of high-quality product candidates. We are focusing on biological pathways for which we can leverage this body of existing scientific knowledge to rapidly generate highly differentiated, small-molecule drug candidates and to identify promising combination therapies and clinical settings in which to pursue them. We believe that this approach mitigates our risk and allows us to create and develop high-quality drug candidates targeting critical immune pathways more quickly and efficiently than would otherwise be possible.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad Range of Mechanisms. We are focused on developing product candidates that act against a broad range of mechanisms that enable tumors to evade eradication by the immune system. The approved checkpoint inhibitors only relieve T cell suppression and do not directly impact other immune cells nor directly enhance immune system function. Collectively, our small molecules and antibodies cover a much broader spectrum of anti-tumor immune mechanisms. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ubiquitously Important Targets. We focus on targets that are ubiquitous, meaning that they are believed to play an important role in a broad range of human cancer types and settings. For example, CD73, the key enzyme responsible for the generation of extracellular adenosine, has been found to be over-expressed in many tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, breast cancer (particularly triple-negative breast cancer), ovarian cancer, and others, suggesting that it plays a broad immuno-protective role in tumor survival. In fact, high levels of CD73 expression in certain tumors have been shown to correlate with reduced survival rates and reduced responses to certain chemotherapy and immuno-oncology agents. Given the broad applicability of our targets, we are evaluating AB928 in multiple tumor types utilizing trials that will allow us to explore several combination settings in parallel, starting with relatively small patient cohorts. We believe that our focus on targets and pathways that are ubiquitously involved in cancer will enable our product candidates to address broad patient populations and significant market opportunities.

Our Approach to Building a Broad and Differentiated Portfolio 
 To exploit the potential of these scientifically well understood immuno-oncology pathways and targets, we are focusing our internal discovery effort on novel small-molecule product candidates. While all immuno-oncology agents approved to date are large molecules, such as the anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, we believe that both small and large molecule modalities will be critical in addressing the many different immune-mediated pathways that may be dysregulated in a patient’s tumor. As many immuno-oncology pathways are not amenable to intervention by antibodies or protein therapeutics, we expect that small-molecule approaches will allow us to access a significantly greater number of potential targets, including intracellular and extracellular enzymes, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and kinases. In addition, in some cases, small molecules may prove superior to large-molecule approaches against the same target. For example, we have shown in in vitro studies that our small-molecule CD73 inhibitors can achieve a greater degree of CD73 inhibition than certain antibodies against this target that are in clinical development. 
 Our internal discovery effort is designed to create and advance small-molecule product candidates with the ideal pharmacological properties for the tumor micro-environment and the target of interest. Small-molecule drugs against the same biological target can be highly differentiated from each other based on their respective pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and biophysical properties. For example, many small-molecule drugs are potent when tested in buffer solution but lose a significant amount of this potency in physiologically relevant media such as blood or tumor tissue, due to a phenomenon known as “plasma protein binding” in which compounds bind non-specifically to albumin and other abundant proteins found in such tissues. We rigorously test our molecules in whole blood or other physiologically relevant systems and only advance molecules that retain a high degree of activity when tested under such “real world” conditions
. We also design our molecules to have the ideal pharmacological properties for the targeted pathway and the desired clinical effect. For example, we specifically designed our A2R antagonist AB928 to have a greatly reduced ability to cross the blood brain barrier, as we believe that this attribute will allow us to dose the compound at higher levels before the appearance of any potential adverse events associated with inhibition of the A2aR receptor in the brain. We also designed AB928 to inhibit both the A2aR and A2bR receptors, as we believe that a dual A2R antagonist will have broader immunological and anti-tumor activity than a selective A2aR antagonist. 
 To support our strategy of pursuing multiple intra-portfolio combinations, we are building a diverse portfolio of product candidates that target different immune mechanisms. In addition to small molecules, we are also developing antibody product candidates that target what we believe are some of the most important immune checkpoint receptors, including PD-1 and TIGIT, and that we expect to be critical components of our future intra-portfolio combinations. By combining these antibody candidates with our internally discovered small-molecule product candidates, we believe we can create highly differentiated combination products. We also plan to fully explore potential synergies between our molecules and standard-of-care treatments, such as chemotherapy, when there is a strong biological rationale, such as the case of combining our ATP-adenosine pathway inhibitors AB928 and AB680 with certain chemotherapeutic agents. 
 Given that the treatment of cancer continues to evolve towards the use of agents that are specific for particular tumor profiles, we are exploring biomarkers that may predict a patient’s response to treatment. Patients’ tumors being considered for immune-based therapies are already routinely tested for certain markers, such as PD-L1 expression or the absence of DNA-repair mechanisms, to determine whether they are appropriate candidates for anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy. In certain settings, we may incorporate biomarker screening into our clinical trials to increase the likelihood of success by focusing on patients that are most likely to respond to our product candidates. In our AB928 combination trials, we are measuring CD73 levels in all enrolled patients in order to determine the value of incorporating screening for CD73 expression into our future clinical trials.

Our Approach to Clinical Development 
 Our approach to clinical development is to pursue strategies that allow us to generate meaningful data on our product candidates in the most efficient manner possible, which should allow us to rapidly advance our product candidates through clinical trials. Some of the key elements of our approach include: 

• | Focus our development efforts on combination products, particularly those that are intra-portfolio. To maximize the potential of our small-molecule product candidates, we are focusing our development efforts on combining them with other agents that we expect to be synergistic with our small molecules. We have in-licensed two antibody product candidates, both of which we expect to be synergistic with our small molecule product candidates, which allows us to pursue multiple intra-portfolio combinations incorporating our internally discovered small-molecule product candidates. While we have initially focused on the development of doublet therapies, such as the combination of AB928 and AB122, we also plan to pursue triplet therapies, which would incorporate two or three of our product candidates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Design our clinical trials to advance our compounds as quickly and efficiently as possible. Following the identification of our recommended dose from our dose escalation trials, we plan to initiate expansion cohorts in multiple tumor types. We have designed our trials to enable us to quickly close or increase the size of our expansion cohorts based on initial tumor response data generated in that cohort, which we believe is an efficient way to study our product candidates in multiple tumor types. Each cohort will enroll an initial 15 patients and up to a total of 40 patients, a sample size we believe would allow us to make a determination regarding further clinical development options. The trials could allow for the opening of control cohorts in which patients are given just one of the agents present in our drug combinations or the initiation of cohorts exploring triplet combinations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For some of our small-molecule product candidates, we may choose to initiate clinical testing in healthy volunteers, as we have done with AB928 and AB680. A healthy volunteer trial allows us to characterize our product candidates in a more controlled setting than is possible in a clinical trial with cancer patients and to evaluate our product candidates in a relatively large number of subjects over a relatively short time period. Healthy volunteer trials allow us to generate data on the safety, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of our product candidates, providing meaningful information on receptor coverage, half-life, optimal dosing regimen and consistency of the product candidate’s activity across human subjects. This information in turn allows us to initiate dosing in cancer patients at a potentially higher dose and with a better understanding of the product candidate’s biological and pharmacological profile. For example, we were able to start our dose escalation trials of AB928 in cancer patients at a daily dose of 75 mg, much higher than the starting dose that would have been required by regulatory guidelines related to first human dose selection. 
 We may also initiate clinical trials for our product candidates in certain regions outside the United States where it would allow us to accelerate our enrollment times. For example, we initiated our first clinical trial for AB122 in Australia, which we believe allowed us to accelerate the time from regulatory submission to the initiation of dosing in patients relative to what would have been possible in the United States. Most of our other clinical trials in cancer patients were initiated first in Australia to similarly expedite study initiation of these studies, following which we have obtained FDA clearance to initiate patient enrollment in the United States.  
  
• | Select tumor types and settings based on biological and commercial rationale. In selecting tumor types to pursue, we are focusing on those types that are most dependent on the pathways targeted by our agents, such as tumors with high levels of CD73 expression for ATP-adenosine inhibitors. We are also focusing on patient populations and settings where we believe there is still considerable unmet need. As an example, for our AB122 combinations, we are focusing on patient populations that have generally been shown not to be responsive to checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1 antibodies. In the case of our chemotherapy combinations, we are focusing on tumor types in which that particular chemotherapy is already considered the standard of care, such as the case of oxaliplatin-containing regimens in the treatment of colorectal cancer. In addition, we are pursuing settings where significant clinical data already exist for the agent that will be evaluated in combination with our product candidates. We believe that this will allow us to determine whether the data we generate in our expansion cohorts are differentiated from the current standard of care.

Our Strategy 
 Our objective is to transform the treatment of cancer by creating a broad portfolio of innovative immuno-oncology therapeutics and developing combinations that offer significant improvement over current treatment options. To achieve this objective, we are pursuing the following strategies: 

• | Rapidly advance our lead product candidates and combinations through clinical development in multiple tumor types. Three of our product candidates, AB928, AB154 and AB122, are being tested in Phase 1/1b combination trials. Safety, pharmacodynamic and pharmacological data on AB928 from our Phase 1 healthy volunteer trial supported selection of a higher starting dose in our first AB928 clinical trials in cancer patients, which is evaluating doublet combinations of AB928 with various forms of chemotherapy and AB122. In these trials, our goal is to generate sufficiently robust data in certain tumor types to allow us to advance the AB928+chemotherapy and/or the AB928+AB122 combination into a large, randomized trial that could potentially support regulatory approval. We may also pursue exploratory studies of selected triplet therapies within these trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue combinations and tumor types based on strong biological rationales. We are pursuing therapeutic combinations supported by strong biological rationales that suggest synergy between the agents. For example, activation of A2aR receptors on T cells has been shown to impair the ability of anti-PD-1 antibodies to enhance activation of those T cells, providing a strong rationale for combining anti-PD-1 therapy with our agents that target the ATP-adenosine pathway. We are also selecting tumor types that we believe will be most sensitive to our product candidates’ mechanisms of action, such as those that have high CD73 expression and T cell infiltration in the cases of AB928 and AB680. In our later-stage trials, we will likely screen for patients with certain tumor profiles, such as high CD73 expression, which should enhance the likelihood of success of these product candidates. In combination trials that involve AB122, we will determine whether expression level of PD-L1 influences the response rate in a particular tumor type.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Control, or otherwise secure access to, all the components of our desired therapeutic combinations. As anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies are currently considered the backbone therapy of immuno-oncology treatment, we believed that it was critical to ensure access to this type of molecule to pursue and control the development of multiple intra-portfolio combinations. In 2017, we in-licensed an IND-ready anti-PD-1 antibody from WuXi Biologics. We also in-licensed a preclinical-stage anti-TIGIT antibody that we believe has the potential to become a backbone therapy in the future, and we will continue to evaluate and pursue other molecules that we believe will be critical elements of our combination strategy. By having these antibody product candidates in our portfolio, we can better control the clinical trial design and timelines and retain much of the economics of any resulting products that receive regulatory approval.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to expand our pipeline of novel small-molecule product candidates. We have initiated clinical trials for four product candidates, including two product candidates that we discovered in-house. Approximately 80% of our workforce is dedicated to research and development, and we plan to continue to invest in our discovery capability and to expand our pipeline. A key element of our portfolio strategy is to create second-generation molecules for our small-molecule programs; these compounds may possess differentiated pharmacological profiles and are generally derived from chemical scaffolds distinct from the one from which the first-generation product candidate was selected. We have selected a selective A2aR antagonist (AB745) as a second-generation or back-up molecule for AB928. For AB680, the initial intravenous formulation, currently in clinical testing, is being followed by an oral formulation of the same molecule, which we believe will provide unique clinical flexibility in selecting the optimal dosing schedule as a function of various drug combination partners. We are actively working on two early-stage programs aimed at modulating various aspects of the anti-tumor immune response which we believe play an important role in many human cancers. We anticipate selecting a development product candidate from at least one of these new programs and initiating its CMC/preclinical development program during 2019.

• | Diversify and broaden the scope of small-molecule drug discovery programs. We have strategically initiated drug discovery programs in two areas outside immuno-oncology. In oncology, we have initiated efforts against two cancer cell-intrinsic pathways that we believe are important drivers of growth and survival of certain types of cancer. We are also in the process of initiating drug discovery efforts against a biological pathway that we believe plays an important role in human inflammatory/auto-immune diseases.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retain significant economic and commercial rights to our programs in key geographic areas. We plan to retain significant economic and commercial rights to our portfolio in the United States and certain other regions. We have pursued and will continue to evaluate opportunities to out-license rights to our product candidates in regions in which we are unlikely to pursue development and commercialization on our own, as was the case with our option and license agreement with Taiho for Japan and certain other territories in Asia (excluding China). In the future, we may enter into strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies in the United States or Europe if we believe the partnership enables us to accelerate the development and commercialization of our programs while allowing us to retain meaningful rights to our product candidates.

Our ATP-Adenosine Programs 
 The ATP-Adenosine Pathway and Its Relevance in Cancer 
 Our initial focus is on the ATP-adenosine pathway, which, when activated, has potent immuno-suppressive effects in the tumor microenvironment, thereby preventing the immune system from recognizing and destroying cancer cells. The activation of this pathway begins with the release from cells of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Under normal conditions, ATP is found primarily intracellularly, where it is the primary source of cellular energy; however, under conditions of cellular damage or cell death, large amounts of ATP are released extracellularly. On its own, ATP acts as a “danger signal” to alert and activate the innate immune system. However, an enzyme known as CD39 converts the extracellular ATP into adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and another enzyme known as CD73 subsequently converts AMP into adenosine, which has profound immunosuppressive properties. This process, which results in the generation of large amounts of extracellular adenosine, evolved to protect human tissue from excessive inflammation by counteracting the pro-inflammatory effects of ATP. However, cancer cells have hijacked this mechanism to prevent the immune system from efficiently recognizing and eradicating them. 
 Once generated, adenosine can bind to and activate four different G-protein coupled receptors: A1R, A2aR, A2bR and A3R. Of these, only the A2aR and A2bR receptors are believed to play a role in intra-tumoral immune suppression as described below: 
  
• | A2aR. The binding of adenosine to the A2aR receptor, which is expressed on T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells, leads to increased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the impairment of maturation and/or activation of T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells. This process significantly impairs the activation of the immune system against cancer cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the relationship between A2aR, PD-1, and T cell receptor (TCR) activation on T cells is becoming increasingly elucidated. Increased cAMP levels induce specific biochemical and transcriptional changes in T cells that interfere with TCR signaling, decrease the levels of certain proteins (such as CD28) necessary for optimal T cell activation and elevate the levels of certain proteins (such as PD-1) that inhibit T cell activation. As a result, A2aR receptor signaling may play a role in development of resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. 
  
• | A2bR. The binding of adenosine to the A2bR receptor, which is primarily expressed on myeloid cells, further contributes to the impaired maturation/activation of dendritic cells, a process that is critical for the generation of an adaptive immune response against tumor antigens. Activation of the A2bR receptor by adenosine also decreases the anti-tumor activity of pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1). Therefore, adenosine binding to A2bR results in further impairment of the maturation/activation of these myeloid cells and activates a distinct process that protects tumor cells from the immune system.

One of the significant consequences of A2aR and A2bR activation on tumor-infiltrating immune cells is a decrease in effector T cell (Teff) numbers and activity, as well as simultaneous increases in regulatory T cell (Treg) numbers and activity and decreases in inflammatory cytokine production. Teff and Treg play opposite roles in their attack and protection, respectively, of cancer cells. Their numbers and, more importantly, their ratios are frequently indicative of a cancer patient’s likely prognosis; specifically, a higher Teff to Treg ratio is generally correlated with a better prognosis. 
 The enzymes CD39 and CD73 are upregulated in response to various stimuli, such as the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and certain growth factors and cytokines. In addition, the commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic agents oxaliplatin and doxorubicin also induce elevated CD39 and CD73 levels, which may result in an immunosuppressive response that counteracts some of the potentially beneficial effects of these chemotherapies. Consistent with the relationship between hypoxia and elevated CD73 expression, several studies, including those published by Gao et al. (BioMed. Res. Intl. (2014) i.d. 460654; see Table 2), Loi et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (2013) 110(27): 11091-11096), and Inoue et al. (Oncotarget, January 2017), as well as public databases, such as the National Institutes of Health’s The Cancer Genome Atlas database, have shown that CD73 is overexpressed in multiple tumor types and that high CD73 expression is correlated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancer. These include non-small-cell lung carcinoma, colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer and gastroesophageal cancer. These studies demonstrate the broad potential of CD73 inhibition in many oncology settings. 
 Our Product Candidates Targeting the ATP-Adenosine Pathway 
 We are pursuing what we consider to be the two most critical targets within the ATP-adenosine pathway: the A2aR/A2bR receptors and the enzyme CD73. Due to the significant and growing amount of scientific literature, including papers by Vijayan et al. (Nat. Rev. Cancer (2017) 17: 709-724); Ohta (Front. Immunol. (2016) 7: article 109); and Allard et al. (Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. (2016) 29: 7-16), supporting the critical role of the ATP-adenosine pathway in cancer, several companies have recently repurposed for oncology A2aR receptor-selective antagonists that were originally developed for Parkinson’s disease and other CNS disorders. These repurposed molecules were originally developed to inhibit the effects of adenosine in the brain, where adenosine is present in much smaller quantities than in the tumor microenvironment. These molecules were also specifically designed to cross the blood brain barrier, which could limit the use of higher doses in other settings, like oncology, because of the potential for CNS-mediated adverse events. 
Our Dual Adenosine Receptor Antagonist, AB928 
 Our most advanced small molecule targeting the ATP-adenosine pathway, AB928, is an orally bioavailable, highly potent, reversible antagonist of the A2aR and A2bR receptors. AB928 is currently in a Phase 1/1b program in cancer patients to evaluate it in combination with chemotherapy and AB122 (our anti-PD-1 antibody). We may also develop AB928 in combination with other agents for which a strong biological rationale exists supporting their synergy with A2R antagonism. 
 We believe that AB928 is the first A2R antagonist in clinical development that inhibits both the A2aR and A2bR receptors and which was designed specifically for the oncology setting. As a result, AB928 has several attributes that differentiate it from the other A2R antagonists in clinical development, including: 
  
• | High potency and low plasma protein binding. We have shown that AB928 is more potent against A2aR in buffer than the A2aR antagonists currently in clinical development. More importantly, AB928 is significantly more potent than these A2aR antagonists when we evaluated them under conditions that more closely resemble the tumor microenvironment. In these studies, we evaluated AB928 in an assay using whole blood, instead of buffer, and in the presence of high levels of NECA (a synthetic analogue of adenosine). Blood, like tumors, contains much higher concentrations of albumin than the brain. As albumin non-specifically binds to many small-molecule drugs, resulting in a dramatic loss of effective potency, blood represents a more representative biological medium for the evaluation of the potency of small-molecule drugs. The high levels of NECA used in this experiment are representative of the high concentrations of adenosine that have been measured in many solid tumors; these levels can be as much as 100 times higher than those found in the brain. Because the other A2aR antagonists in clinical development were developed with a focus on activity in the brain, they were not necessarily designed to work in the presence of the much higher levels of adenosine that are found in tumors.

When we evaluated AB928 under these conditions, AB928 was significantly more potent at inhibiting A2aR activation, as measured by phosphorylated CREB (pRCEB), than the A2aR antagonists in clinical development, as shown in the graph below. CREB is a transcription factor that becomes phosphorylated when the A2aR is activated; thus, the level of pCREB inhibition is a measure of an A2aR antagonist’s ability to inhibit A2aR activation. The table below on the right shows the calculated IC50 values for the various compounds in this experiment. The IC50 values indicate the concentration of each compound necessary to achieve 50% inhibition of pCREB formation. Therefore, lower values reflect greater compound potency. 
 


 
a | Measured in human blood CD8+ T cells; CREB is a transcription factor that becomes phosphorylated when A2aR is activated; thus, the level of pCREB inhibition is a measure of the ability of an A2aR antagonist to inhibit A2aR activation.

• | Dual antagonism of the A2aR and A2bR receptors. Unlike the repurposed A2aR receptor-selective molecules that were initially developed for CNS indications, we designed our A2R antagonist to optimize its properties for use in immuno-oncology. As such, we designed AB928 to inhibit both the A2aR and A2bR receptors, since the binding of adenosine to A2bR receptors on myeloid cells contributes to adenosine-mediated immune suppression. Therefore, we expect that AB928 could have broader immunological activity than the selective A2aR antagonists. The scientific literature also supports the role of A2bR receptors in different types of cancer, such as triple-negative breast and ovarian cancers.

The following table summarizes data we have generated in our cell-based assays conducted in buffer evaluating the potency of AB928 against A2aR and A2bR, relative to the selective A2aR antagonists. As shown below, AB928 is the most potent inhibitor of A2aR receptors and is the only compound that meaningfully inhibits A2bR receptors.

c | KB is a measure of a compound’s thermodynamic ability to bind/block its target receptor; lower KB values reflect greater potency for a given receptor.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low penetration across the blood brain barrier. Unlike the other A2aR antagonists that were specifically designed to penetrate and act in the brain, we have designed AB928 to minimize penetration of the blood-brain barrier. As shown in the graph below, the concentration of AB928 measured in the brain corresponds to approximately 1% of the concentration found in blood. We believe that this characteristic could allow us to dose at levels necessary to achieve high receptor coverage of AB928 in the tumor microenvironment while avoiding the potential for CNS-related toxicities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High tumor/plasma ratio. Another rationale for selecting AB928 as our lead A2aR/A2bR antagonist development candidate is that a relatively high level of the compound penetrates the tumor. The graph below shows the concentration of AB928 in the tumor and plasma over time in tumor-bearing mice and demonstrates that AB928 achieves significant tumor penetration.

• | Attractive pharmacokinetics. We designed AB928 to have high oral bioavailability and a human half-life to support once-daily dosing. Other A2aR antagonists in clinical development are being dosed to patients twice per day, presumably reflecting their relatively low oral bioavailability and/or short half-life in humans. Molecules with good oral bioavailability and long half-lives that can be dosed only once per day generally have lower “peak-to-trough” fluctuations in plasma levels between doses. This is important in cases in which the dose-limiting toxicities of the drugs are associated with high peak plasma levels; in these cases, higher overall drug exposures are possible when those drugs have longer half-lives, such as is the case with AB928. Data from our completed Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers shows an excellent half-life of approximately 20 hours, which allows for once-daily dosing (see next section for more details).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on the important differentiated characteristics summarized above, we believe that AB928 could prove to have more robust anti-tumor effects and activity in a broader range of tumor types than the A2aR antagonists in clinical development. 
 
Our Clinical Development Strategy for AB928 
 Our initial development efforts for AB928 are focused on combination trials evaluating AB928 with our anti-PD-1 antibody, AB122, and with certain chemotherapeutics. The rationale for selecting these two combination partners for AB928 are as follows: 

• | Anti-PD-1 Therapy, such as AB122. A2aR activation by adenosine induces biochemical and transcriptional changes in T cells that interfere with TCR signaling, decreases the levels of certain proteins (such as CD28) necessary for optimal T cell activation and elevates levels of certain proteins (such as PD-1) that inhibit T cell activation. As a result, A2aR receptor signaling may play a role in the development of resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Certain Chemotherapy. Certain chemotherapies, such as oxaliplatin and doxorubicin, induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in cancer cells, a process that is characterized by, among other features, endoplasmic reticulum stress and enhanced release of ATP into the extracellular environment. In tumors that express high levels of CD73, this ATP is readily converted into adenosine, resulting in profound immune suppression which can counteract the potential anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our clinical development strategy for AB928 is designed to achieve rapid proof-of-concept in one or more tumor types and to advance AB928 into a registrational trial as quickly as possible. As we expect that the anti-tumor activity of AB928 will result primarily from combination with other agents, we have focused our development efforts on combination trials of AB928 with other mechanisms that are expected to be synergistic with inhibition of the ATP-adenosine pathway, such as anti-PD-1 antibodies and ICD-inducing chemotherapies. In our combination trials, we are focusing on tumor types for which there is substantial evidence that they may rely on the immune-suppressive effects of adenosine. These tumor types share the following characteristics: 
  
• | Infiltration with T cells (as T cells need to be present in the tumor for an adenosine receptor antagonist to have an effect).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tumors characterized by high CD73 expression, as evidence that the tumor has the ability to produce adenosine (examples, based on published literature, include non-small-cell lung carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies or ICD-inducing chemotherapy are currently considered or expected to become the standard of care. Examples include the use of oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy in colorectal cancer and gastroesophageal cancer; carboplatin in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer; or the use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma.

We completed a Phase 1 trial of AB928 in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2018 (Seitz, L., Jin, L., Leleti, M. et al. Invest New Drugs (2018). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10637-018-0706-6). This blinded, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 85 subjects at a single site in the Netherlands and included single-ascending-dose and multiple-ascending-dose escalation cohorts. Study subjects were randomized 3:1 to either AB928 or placebo. This trial provided us with significant insights into the safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of AB928, which allowed us to start the dose-escalation portion of our planned combination trials in cancer patients at a higher dose than would otherwise be possible. 
 We completed both the single-ascending-dose and multiple-ascending-dose portions of this trial, administering single doses of AB928 up to 150 mg in the single-ascending-dose cohorts and 200 mg in the multiple-ascending-dose cohorts in healthy volunteers. At these doses, AB928 demonstrated over 90% inhibition of the A2aR receptor. As shown in the following graph, increasing doses of AB928 resulted in dose proportional increases in plasma levels of AB928. The plasma half-life of AB928 following a single dose has been shown to be approximately 20 hours which supports once daily dosing. 

15


We have developed a pCREB assay to study the pharmacodynamics of AB928, or the degree to which AB928 inhibits pCREB formation (a marker for A2aR inhibition), at each dose level administered in our Phase 1 trial. We collected blood samples from the healthy volunteers at time points corresponding to pre-dose, 2 hours post dose, and 24 hours post dose, incubated these blood samples with 5 µM NECA ex vivo to activate the A2aR receptor and analyzed the samples as described in our earlier pCREB study. The following graph shows data for the 150 mg AB928 single-dose cohort and specifically the mean pCREB activation signal for the pooled placebo group (6 subjects) and for the healthy volunteers receiving 150 mg of AB928 (6 subjects) over the timepoints indicated. Prior to dosing, all subjects responded to 5 µM NECA by increasing the levels of pCREB in their blood CD8+ T cells. As shown in the graph below, two hours after dosing, the placebo group maintained their pCREB activation signal in response to NECA stimulation while the 150 mg AB928 group had no detectable pCREB signal, demonstrating that AB928 was able to completely block the activation of A2aR by NECA. Twenty-four hours after dosing, the placebo group maintained a response similar to their pre-dose level, while the 150 mg AB928 group only showed approximately 10% of the response seen pre-dose, indicating that the levels of AB928 remaining at 24 hours were still sufficient to inhibit approximately 90% of the NECA-mediated activation of A2aR. 
 

In the second half of 2018, we initiated a clinical trial in cancer patients for AB928 in combination with AB122, our anti-PD-1 antibody. The dose-escalation portion of this trial is assessing the safety profile of increasing dose levels of AB928 when combined with a fixed dose of AB122 and will allow us to identify the recommended dose of AB928 + AB122 for future trials. Once we have determined the recommended dose of AB928 + AB122, we plan to initiate an expansion cohort to evaluate this combination in renal cell carcinoma, which we expect to initiate in the first half of 2019. This expansion cohort will initially enroll approximately 15 patients and will be expanded to up to 40 patients dependent on a predetermined minimum response rate.  
 In parallel with our regulatory application for our AB928 + AB122 combination trial, we initiated clinical trials in cancer patients for AB928 in combination with two different types of ICD-inducing chemotherapies (generally referred to here as chemotherapy), specifically platinum-based therapy and anthracycline-based therapy. Once the recommended dose is determined for AB928 in combination with a fixed dose of each chemotherapy partner, we plan to advance these combinations into selected expansion cohorts.  The dose-escalation portion of our combination trials of AB928 + Doxil® and AB928 + mFOLFOX began enrolling patients in 2018, and we currently expect the dose-expansion portion to begin enrolling patients in the second half of 2019. We are also initiating a clinical trial of AB928 in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed with or without pembrolizumab, which we anticipate will begin enrolling patients in the dose-escalation portion in mid-2019. We have selected tumor types in which to evaluate these combinations based on considerations consistent with those outlined above, namely, tumor types that are associated with high expression of CD73, that are generally known to be accessible to T cell infiltration, and for which one of the chemotherapies of interest are already considered standard of care. For the expansion cohorts shown below, there already exists significant historical response data for anti-PD-1 therapy or ICD-inducing chemotherapy alone. We expect that this will enable us to better quantify the potential clinical benefits of our combination therapies in comparison to these standards of care.

The following schematic depicts the designs for the clinical trials described above.  
 
TNBC: triple negative breast cancer; GE: gastroesophageal cancer; CRC: colorectal cancer; NSCLC: non-small cell lung cancer; RP2D: recommended Phase 2 dose; TKI: tyrosine kinase inhibitor; RCC: renal cell carcinoma.
 An important component of our development program is the incorporation of a biomarker strategy to identify patients most likely to benefit from AB928. In our initial clinical trials of AB928 in patients, we are testing patients’ tumors for CD73 expression and expect to use CD73 expression as a tool to select patients in future trials. We will also evaluate other tumor and blood markers designed to establish the extent of in vivo inhibition of the adenosine system, assess the effects of AB928 on the anti-tumor immune response, and identify additional biomarkers that are potentially predictive of response to AB928 and that could be used to screen patients in our future clinical trials. 
 Our CD73 Inhibitor Program 
 Our next most advanced program in the adenosine pathway targets the CD73 enzyme, which plays a critical role in the last step of the process of extracellular ATP conversion into adenosine. CD73 inhibition should therefore be a highly effective approach to inhibiting the activation of adenosine-mediated immune suppression, as it could significantly suppress adenosine generation. 
 Optimization of our CD73 inhibitors was facilitated through a collaboration with Professor Norbert Sträter (University of Leipzig), a structural biologist who has solved the structure of multiple complexes of CD73 bound to our compounds. We have utilized this information in a structure-based drug design effort to create small-molecule inhibitors of CD73 with extraordinary potency in the picomolar range. These compounds include some with extremely long half-lives, such as our lead development candidate, AB680, which we believe could be dosed intravenously in the clinic at the same time that a patient receives anti-PD-1 therapy or chemotherapy. This compound, AB680, can also be dosed orally. We expect to complete preclinical studies (CMC and GLP toxicology studies) on the oral AB680 product candidate in 2019. 
 17


We believe AB680 is the first small-molecule CD73 inhibitor to enter clinical development. While there are several anti-CD73 antibodies in development, we believe that a small-molecule approach to CD73 inhibition could offer several advantages, including: 
  
• | More complete inhibition of CD73 enzymatic activity. As illustrated in the graph below, we have shown in our assays that our small-molecule CD73 inhibitor, AB680, inhibits CD73 more potently and effectively than one of the anti-CD73 antibodies in clinical development, MEDI9447. One explanation for this difference in potency is that our small-molecule CD73 inhibitors bind in the active site of the CD73 enzyme and they do so with an affinity about ten million times greater than the affinity of its substrate, AMP, for CD73. In contrast, many anti-CD73 antibodies were not designed to inhibit the enzymatic activity of CD73 but to instead induce internalization of CD73 from the cell surface and therefore will be less effective at inhibiting soluble forms of CD73. There are significant levels of soluble CD73 that have been shed from the cell surface. Our small-molecule inhibitors display comparable potency and effectiveness against soluble as well as membrane-bound forms of CD73, while at least some of the CD73 antibodies in development are unable to completely inhibit the enzymatic action of soluble CD73.

---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deeper tumor penetration. As small molecules, we expect that our CD73 inhibitors should be able to achieve better penetration of tumor tissue relative to the CD73 antibodies which are much larger molecules. We have shown, in tumor-bearing mice, that the concentrations of our inhibitors in the tumor tissue are approximately 15-20% of those in the blood, demonstrating their ability to permeate well beyond the tumor micro-vasculature. It is well accepted that monoclonal antibodies, because of their molecular size and properties, cannot diffuse further than a few microns from the blood vessel that delivers them to the tumor.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for both intravenous and oral delivery. We are developing both oral and injectable formulations of our CD73 inhibitors, which could provide flexibility on dosing regimens. We expect that AB680 dosed once every two or three weeks, on the same schedule as an anti-PD-1 antibody or a chemotherapeutic agent, would be very convenient for patients and also be very attractive commercially. An orally formulated AB680 would be highly convenient for patients not undergoing regular infusions.

Our Clinical Development Strategy for AB680 
 We initiated a clinical trial of AB680 in healthy volunteers during the second half of 2018. We currently plan to model the early development program for AB680 after our development strategy for AB928 and expect to initiate dose-escalation trials of AB680 in combination with AB122 and with chemotherapy by the second half of 2019. The selection of tumor types in which to evaluate the clinical effects of AB680 will be influenced by our analysis of settings (such as colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer) in which we believe that the generation of adenosine by CD73 plays an important role in immunosuppression. It is possible that response rates and/or duration of response of a particular tumor type might be different for AB928 versus AB680 treatment.  
Our Antibody Programs 
 In addition to our small-molecule programs, we are developing antibody drug candidates that are currently considered to be backbone therapy in immuno-oncology or that have the potential to be backbone therapy in the future, such as our in-licensed anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT antibodies. Our strategy is to create differentiated combination products by combining these antibodies with our internally discovered small-molecule product candidates. In addition, by having these antibodies in our portfolio, we can better control the combinations that we pursue, as well as potentially capture a greater share of the value of the combination products. As a result, we have established internal capabilities that allow us to evaluate and develop antibody drug candidates and will continue to explore opportunities to create or in-license antibodies that we believe will be critical to our intra-portfolio combination development strategy. 
Our Anti-PD-1 Antibody, AB122 
 In 2017, we in-licensed our anti-PD-1 antibody, which we refer to as AB122, from WuXi Biologics. AB122 is a fully human IgG4 antibody that was generated by WuXi Biologics using the transgenic rat platform from Open Monoclonal Technology. The biochemical, biological and preclinical properties of AB122 have been shown by WuXi Biologics and us to be comparable to those of the marketed anti-PD-1 antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab. We are currently evaluating AB122 in cancer patients in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial.  
Our Clinical Development Strategy for AB122 
 In 2017, we initiated dosing in Australia for our Phase 1 trial of AB122 in cancer patients. We decided to start our clinical testing of AB122 in Australia because we were able to proceed from regulatory filing to dosing of the first patient much more quickly than would have been the case in the United States. We also believe that we were able to enroll patients more quickly in Australia than in the United States, because there are more patients that have not received anti-PD-1 therapy in Australia. From this Phase 1 trial of AB122, we have identified 240 mg administered every two weeks as the dosing regimen to use in combination trials with AB928. To date, we have dosed 24 patients and AB122 has exhibited a pharmacokinetic profile similar to nivolumab. As discussed above under the section titled “—Our Clinical Development Strategy for AB928”, this will be followed by various dose-expansion cohorts that will evaluate the combination in carefully chosen tumor types. 
 We are evaluating various strategies to demonstrate the clinical benefit of AB122 monotherapy, given its role as a cornerstone of our combination strategy. In mid-2019, we plan to initiate a dose expansion cohort which would evaluate AB122 as a single agent in approximately 30-40 cancer patients in a tumor type known to be responsive to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, such as non-small-cell lung cancer. 
 Our Anti-TIGIT Antibody, AB154 
 Our second antibody program targets TIGIT (T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains), a unique immune checkpoint target, because its primary ligand, CD155, plays both inhibitory and stimulatory roles in regulating the activity of effector immune cells such as T and NK cells. TIGIT is an inhibitory receptor highly expressed on T cells displaying an exhausted phenotype, tumor-infiltrating Treg, and NK cells. The ligands for TIGIT are expressed on a large number of cancer cells and on other immune cells such as dendritic cells, and their binding to TIGIT results in inhibition of immune cells. 
 19


In addition to TIGIT, CD155 binds, with lower affinity, to DNAM-1 (also known as CD226), a stimulatory receptor also expressed on T cells and NK cells. As a result, when anti-TIGIT antibodies bind to TIGIT, thereby blocking the TIGIT:CD155 interaction, they not only block an inhibitory signal on T cells and NK cells but also free up CD155 to bind to and activate DNAM-1, leading to increased activation of T cells and NK cells. The graphic below further illustrates the TIGIT:CD155 interaction and consequences of inhibiting TIGIT. 


 
• | TIGIT binds to CD155 (high affinity) and CD112 (low affinity)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | DNAM-1 competes, with lower affinity than TIGIT, for binding to CD155
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | TIGIT binding to CD155 results in reduced function of effector immune cells
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CD155 binding to DNAM-1 results in activation of immune cells
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | When an anti-TIGIT antibody binds to TIGIT, it frees up CD155 to bind to DNAM-1, resulting in activation of effector immune cells
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Concurrent blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 has been shown to be more effective than PD-1 blockade alone in both in vitro and in vivo models. Importantly, high TIGIT expression at initial cancer diagnosis is associated with CD8+ T cell exhaustion and poor clinical outcomes. 
 AB154 is our humanized anti-TIGIT IgG1 monoclonal antibody engineered to lack FcgR binding and effector function (that is, it will not trigger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity—ADCC—or complement-dependent cytotoxicity—CDC). We in-licensed AB154 in 2016. Since that time, we have completed cell line development and other chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, activities and preclinical safety assessment studies.
 
Development Status of AB154 
 In 2018, we began enrollment in a dose-escalation trial investigating AB154 as monotherapy and in combination with AB122 in cancer patients. We estimate that safety, PK/PD and initial clinical activity data will be available from the monotherapy dose-escalation portion of the trial in the second half of 2019; once the recommended Phase 2 dosing regimen (as monotherapy and in the combination) has been established, we plan to evaluate these therapies in selected tumor types, which will be based on results from our work to identify those tumor types with the highest expression levels of CD155 and TIGIT. Leading clinical settings at this time include the following types of cancer: head and neck, triple-negative breast and non-small cell lung cancer.

 We are actively working on two early-stage programs aimed at modulating various aspects of the anti-tumor immune response which we believe play an important role in many human cancers. We anticipate selecting a development product candidate from at least one of these new programs and initiating its CMC/preclinical development program during 2019.
 In order to diversify and broaden the scope of our small-molecule drug discovery programs, we have strategically initiated drug discovery programs in two areas outside immuno-oncology. Firstly, we have initiated efforts against two cancer cell-intrinsic pathways that we believe are important drivers of growth and survival of certain types of cancer. We are also in the process of initiating drug discovery efforts against a biological pathway that we believe plays an important role in a variety of human inflammatory/auto-immune diseases. While these are still very early drug discovery efforts, we would anticipate that one of them will deliver a development product candidate in 2020 and that we will able to initiate CMC/preclinical development on such molecule during 2020.
 
Commercialization Plans 
 We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other regions. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company commercializing products. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans. 
License Agreements 
 Abmuno Therapeutics LLC License Agreement 
 In 2016, we entered into a license agreement (the Abmuno Agreement) with Abmuno Therapeutics LLC (Abmuno) for a worldwide exclusive license to develop, use, manufacture, and commercialize products that include an anti-TIGIT antibody. We licensed AB154 under the Abmuno Agreement. Under the Abmuno Agreement, we have made upfront and milestone payments of $6.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and we may be required to make additional clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments up to $101.8 million. 
 The Abmuno Agreement terminates on the latest of (i) the expiry of the last-to-expire Abmuno licensed patent that covers a product that contains an anti-TIGIT antibody, (ii) the date on which there is no longer an Abmuno licensed patent application that is still pending and has been pending for a certain period of time that covers a product that contains an anti-TIGIT antibody and (iii) 10 years from the date of first commercial sale. 
 WuXi Biologics (Cayman) Inc. License Agreement 
 In 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the WuXi Agreement) with WuXi Biologics (Cayman) Inc. (WuXi Biologics) for an exclusive license to develop, use, manufacture, and commercialize products that include an anti-PD-1 antibody throughout the world except for China and five other countries outside of the United States, Europe and Japan. We licensed AB122 under the WuXi Agreement. Under the WuXi Agreement, we have made upfront and milestone payments of $18.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and we may be required to make additional clinical and regulatory milestone payments, commercialization milestone payments up to $375.0 million, and royalty payments that range from high single-digits to low teens of net sales beginning on the first commercial sale and ending on the later of (i) ten (10) years following such first commercial sale and (ii) the expiry of all patents that may subsequently be issued or granted that cover the product in such country, hereafter referred to as the royalty term. We are also required to pay WuXi Biologics a percentage in the low double digits of certain sublicense income that we receive from our sublicensees in direct connection with our sublicensees’ rights to use WuXi Biologics’s patents, patent applications and know-how. 
 21


We are obligated to appoint WuXi Biologics as our exclusive manufacturer of such licensed products for a certain period of time subject to certain exceptions. Our sublicensees, however, may manufacture, at any time, certain portions of their requirements for such product subject to certain conditions. We made certain covenants not to commercialize any anti-PD-1 antibody licensed or obtained by us after the date of the license agreement with WuXi Biologics other than anti-PD-1 antibodies licensed from WuXi Biologics, subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the WuXi Agreement. 
 This agreement terminates, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, on expiration of the royalty term for such licensed product for the applicable country. 
 Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Option and License Agreement 
 In 2017, we entered into an option and license agreement (the Taiho Agreement) with Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Taiho) pursuant to which Taiho will provide $35.0 million of non-refundable, non-creditable cash payments to us during the first three years of the agreement in exchange for an exclusive option, over a five-year period (the Option Period), to in-license the development and commercialization rights to clinical stage product candidates from our portfolio (each, an Arcus Program) for Japan and certain other territories in Asia (excluding China) (the Taiho Territory). We received $25.0 million in 2017 and we are due an additional $5.0 million of non-refundable and non-creditable payments in both 2018 and 2019. If we do not initiate IND-enabling studies for at least five Arcus Programs prior to the expiration of the Option Period, Taiho may elect to extend the Option Period, up to a maximum of seven years for the Option Period, subject to an extension fee. If Taiho elects to exercise any such options, the license described above will be granted under terms and conditions set forth in the agreement. Under such terms, Taiho is obligated to pay an option exercise payment for each option exercise of between $3.0 million to $15.0 million, with the amount dependent on the development stage of the applicable Arcus Program for which the option is exercised. In addition, Taiho is obligated to pay to us clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones up to $275.0 million with respect to each program for which Taiho exercises the option and been granted the applicable license, as well as royalties ranging from high single digits to mid-teens, on net sales in Taiho’s territories. Royalties will be payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis during the period of time commencing on the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a country and ending upon the later of: (i) ten (10) years from the date of first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country; and (ii) expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of our patents covering the manufacture, use or sale or exploitation of such licensed product in such country. 
 In July 2018, Taiho exercised its option to our adenosine receptor antagonist program for a fee of $3.0 million. Upon this exercise, Taiho now has the sole responsibility for the development and commercialization of licensed products from within the program in the Taiho Territory.
 This agreement will remain in effect until (i) expiration of the last option exercise period if Taiho has not exercised any of its options or (ii) if Taiho has exercised any of its options, expiry of all royalty terms for the licensed products. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational product candidates, as well as for our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates. 
 22


To date, we have obtained active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and drug product for our product candidates from single-source third party contract manufacturers. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our product candidates and intend to put in place framework agreements under which third-party contract manufacturers will generally provide us with necessary quantities of API and drug product on a project-by-project basis based on our development needs. With respect to AB122, we agreed, as part of our license agreement with WuXi Biologics, that WuXi Biologics would be our exclusive manufacturer of AB122 with respect to clinical and commercial supplies until a certain number of years after marketing approval for AB122, subject to certain exceptions. 
 As we advance our product candidates through development, we will consider our lack of redundant supply for the API and drug product for each of our product candidates to protect against any potential supply disruptions. 
 We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop. 
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with new immunotherapies that may become available in the future. 
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop immuno-oncology treatments. There are many other companies that have commercialized and/or are developing immuno-oncology treatments for cancer including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche/Genentech. 
 For our dual adenosine receptor antagonist, AB928, we are aware of several other clinical-stage selective adenosine A2aR antagonists being developed by AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Corvus, and Novartis and a clinical-stage selective adenosine A2bR antagonist being developed by Palobiofarma. To our knowledge, there are no adenosine receptor antagonists approved for the treatment of cancer and the most advanced such adenosine receptor antagonists are in Phase 1/2 clinical trials.
 For our small molecule CD73 inhibitor, AB680, we are aware of several pharmaceutical companies developing antibodies against this target, including AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Corvus and Novartis in collaboration with Surface Oncology, all of whom have advanced their CD73 antibodies into clinical development. Other pharmaceutical companies, such as Calithera and Peloton Therapeutics, have small-molecule programs against this target.  To our knowledge, AB680 is the only small molecule CD73 inhibitor in clinical development.
 For our anti-PD-1 antibody, AB122, multiple large pharmaceutical companies have already received regulatory approvals for their anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, including AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Pfizer in partnership with Merck KGaA, Regeneron in partnership with Sanofi Genzyme and Roche/Genentech. There are also many other anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies in clinical development.
 For our anti-TIGIT antibody, AB154, we are aware of several pharmaceutical companies developing antibodies against this target including Astellas, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Compugen, Genentech, iTEOS, Merck and OncoMed. To our knowledge, there are no approved anti-TIGIT antibodies and the most advanced antibodies are in Phase 1/2 clinical trials.
 23


Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics (if required), the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries for our product candidates, to operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing, in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, patent applications intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, and related discoveries, technologies, inventions and improvements that may be commercially important to our business. We may also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We also intend to take advantage of regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
 We do not yet own or license any issued patents relating to our product candidates. As of February 1, 2019, we own or have in-licensed 12 pending U.S. patent applications, 5 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent applications, and 96 pending foreign patent applications. A PCT patent application is an international patent application that allows an applicant to simultaneously file in more than 150 contracting states via a single patent application. The PCT application can be converted into a “national phase” application in any such contracting state, at which point substantive examination will be performed by the patent office in the jurisdiction (i.e. country or region) in which the national phase application has been filed. As of February 1, 2019, with respect to our adenosine receptor antagonist program, we own 4 U.S. patent applications, 3 PCT patent applications and 7 foreign patent applications directed to compositions of matter and methods of use. As of February 1, 2019, with respect to our CD73 inhibitor program, we own 4 U.S. patent applications, 2 PCT patent applications and 29 foreign patent applications directed to compositions of matter and methods of use. As of February 1, 2019, with respect to our anti-PD-1 antibody program, we in-license 23 foreign patent applications and we own 1 U.S. patent application directed to compositions of matter and methods of use. As of February 1, 2019, with respect to our anti-TIGIT antibody program, we in-license 1 U.S. patent application and 25 foreign patent applications directed to compositions of matter and methods of use. The term of any patents that may issue will vary in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction, but is typically 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. Any patents that may issue from our company-owned or licensed pending applications are projected to expire between 2035 and 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 24


The patent positions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our product candidates and enforce the patent rights that we own or license, and could affect the value of such intellectual property. With respect to both company-owned and licensed intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that the patent applications we are currently pursuing or may file in the future will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Our competitors may independently develop similar product candidates or technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents that we own or exclusively in-license. We cannot be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products or their methods of use or manufacture. Moreover, even issued patents do not guarantee us the right to commercialize our products. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing or manufacturing our product candidates.
 Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a product candidate, it is possible that, before a product can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved product may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved product. While we intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
 Government Regulation
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of therapeutic products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
 In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates drugs and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), and implementing regulations. These laws and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of therapeutic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending regulatory applications, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 25


The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:
  
• | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) or other applicable regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices (GCP), to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submissions to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biological Licensing Application (BLA) for a new product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the facility or facilities where the product candidate is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the therapeutic product candidate’s identify, strength, quality, purity, and potency;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA/BLA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA/BLA.
--+----------------------------------------

 Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate or disease. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific trials or all trials conducted under the IND.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product candidate’s chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product candidate’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The trial protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 26


Clinical trials to support NDAs/BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the product candidate usually into healthy human subjects, the product candidate is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a product candidate demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of the product candidate and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product candidate. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the product candidate. A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in certain circumstances.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA, for a drug product candidate, or a BLA, for a biological product candidate, is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product candidate’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to program user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. 
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Combination products are typically marketed under an application type associated with the constituent part that provides the primary mode of action (PMOA) for the combination product (i.e., an NDA if it has a drug PMOA, a BLA if it has a biological product PMOA. A single marketing application is generally sufficient for a combination product. In some cases, however, a sponsor may wish to submit separate marketing applications for different constituent parts of a combination product, and the FDA may consider this permissible. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information and the resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. Most such applications for standard review product candidates are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the NDA or BLA; most applications for priority review product candidates are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the NDA or BLA. Priority review can be applied to a product candidate that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 Among other things, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use, a BLA to determine whether the product is safe, pure, and potent, and in each case, whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may also refer applications for novel product candidates, or product candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 27


Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. To assure GCP and cGMP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditures of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive. The FDA may disagree with our trial design or interpret data from preclinical studies and clinical trials differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the application identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biological product in the United States with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 Foreign Clinical Trials to Support an IND, NDA, or BLA
 The FDA will accept as support for an IND, NDA, or BLA a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign clinical trial if it was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data from the trial through an on-site inspection, if necessary. A sponsor or applicant who wishes to rely on a non-IND foreign clinical trial to support an IND must submit the following supporting information to the FDA to demonstrate that the trial conformed to GCP:
  
• | the investigator’s qualifications;
--+-----------------------------------


• | a description of the research facilities;
--+------------------------------------------


• | a detailed summary of the protocol and trial results and, if requested, case records or additional background data;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a description of the drug substance and drug product, including the components, formulation, specifications, and, if available, the bioavailability of the product candidate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | information showing that the trial is adequate and well controlled;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the name and address of the independent ethics committee that reviewed the trial and a statement that the independent ethics committee meets the required definition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 28


 
• | a summary of the independent ethics committee’s decision to approve or modify and approve the trial, or to provide a favorable opinion;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a description of how informed consent was obtained;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | a description of what incentives, if any, were provided to subjects to participate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a description of how the sponsor monitored the trial and ensured that the trial was consistent with the protocol;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a description of how investigators were trained to comply with GCP and to conduct the trial in accordance with the trial protocol; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a statement on whether written commitments by investigators to comply with GCP and the protocol were obtained.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Regulatory applications based solely on foreign clinical data meeting these criteria may be approved if the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, the trials have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by FDA or, if FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Failure of an application to meet any of these criteria may result in the application not being approvable based on the foreign data alone.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing product candidates, or provide for the approval of a product candidate on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be lengthened. Generally, product candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of product candidates to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give a product candidate that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness, an initial review within eight months as compared to a standard review time of twelve months.
 Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated product candidate and expedite review of the application for a product candidate designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new product candidate that meets the following criteria: is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, the FDA also provides Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other therapeutics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 After approval, owners of relevant drug or biological product patents may apply for up to a five year patent extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the product’s testing phase—the time between IND and NDA or BLA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA or BLA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
 For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the product candidate covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a product candidate for which an NDA or BLA has not been submitted.
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A product candidate is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new product candidate containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the product candidate substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such product candidate where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing product candidate. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for product candidates containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Biosimilars
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological product candidates shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product candidate and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical trials, animal trials, and a clinical trial or trials, unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services waives a required element. A biosimilar product candidate may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation, which is still being evaluated by the FDA.
 30


A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product candidate submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) 18 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) 18 months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 Post-approval Requirements
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may under some circumstances require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA under some circumstances has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Any product manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:

• | record-keeping requirements;
--+-----------------------------


• | reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | therapeutic sampling and distribution requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | registration and listing requirements; and
--+-------------------------------------------


• | complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Manufacturers, their subcontractors, and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drug and biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP, including data integrity requirements, and other laws. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers engaged by us if our products are approved. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations would also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizures of products, injunctive actions or other civil penalties. We cannot be certain we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials or require us to recall a product from distribution.
 31


In addition, therapeutic manufacturers in the United States must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities, and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate product.
 Additional Controls for Biological Products
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
 After a BLA is approved, the biological product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer.
 In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biological products, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 If use of an in vitro diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic and regulated by FDA as a medical device, at the same time that the FDA approves the product candidate. The review of an in vitro companion diagnostic in conjunction with the review of a product candidate involves coordination of review between internal organizations within FDA. Most companion diagnostics require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMAs are subject to a substantial application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR) which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 32


After a device is placed on the market following appropriate approval or clearance from the FDA, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 New Legislation and Regulations
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector General and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (ACA), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (FCA) (discussed below).
 33


The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. For instance, historically, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Certain of our products, once approved, may be administered by a physician. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain products not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B is part of original Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. As a condition of receiving Medicare Part B reimbursement for a manufacturer’s eligible drugs or biologicals, the manufacturer is required to participate in other government healthcare programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program.
 34


In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price (ASP) and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. It is difficult to predict how Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies will be applied to our products in the future and coverage and reimbursement under different federal healthcare programs are not always consistent. Medicare reimbursement rates may also reflect budgetary constraints placed on the Medicare program.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (Sunshine Act) within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to report accurately could result in penalties. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance.
 35


Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a therapeutic is:
  
• | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


• | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


• | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

 We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 36


The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 For example, the ACA has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in 2014 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 37


 
• | a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. In December 2017, Congress repealed the tax penalty for an individual’s failure to maintain ACA-mandated health insurance as part of a tax reform bill. Congress is continuing to consider legislation that would alter other aspects of the ACA.
 We anticipate that the ACA, if substantially maintained in its current form, will continue to result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
 Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken.
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

Additional Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Other Regulations
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval to conduct clinical trials or market a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) also applies to health-related and other personal data of individuals in the European Union. The GPDR, which went into effect in May 2018, imposes more stringent operational requirements on processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal data is collected, used and shared, limitations on retention of personal data, more stringent requirements pertaining to genetic, biometric and health data, mandatory data breach notification requirements, and higher standards for controllers to demonstrate valid consent for certain data processing activities. The GDPR further provides that European Union Member States may implement their own additional laws and regulations in relation to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could result in differences in the GDPR’s implementation among Member States. The GDPR increases our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we must put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules.
 Australia
 Conducting clinical trials for therapeutic drug candidates in Australia is subject to regulation by Australian regulatory bodies. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the National Health and Medical Research Council set the codes of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) for clinical research in Australia, and compliance with these codes is mandatory. Australia has also adopted international codes, such as those promulgated by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (the ICH). The ICH guidelines must be complied with across all fields of clinical research, including those related to pharmaceutical quality, nonclinical and clinical data requirements and trial designs. The basic requirements for preclinical data to support a first-in-human trial under ICH guidelines are applicable in Australia. Requirements related to adverse event reporting in Australia are similar to those required in other major jurisdictions.

Clinical trials conducted using “unapproved therapeutic goods” in Australia, being those which have not yet been evaluated by the TGA for quality, safety and efficacy must occur pursuant to either the Clinical Trial Notification Scheme (CTN Scheme), or the Clinical Trial Exemption Scheme (CTX Scheme). In each case, the trial is supervised by a Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) an independent review committee set up under guidelines of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council that ensures the protection of rights, safety and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical trial. A HREC does this by reviewing, approving and providing continuing examination of trial protocols and amendments, and of the methods and material to be used in obtaining and documenting informed consent of the trial subjects.
 The CTN Scheme broadly involves:
  
• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to a HREC, of all material relating to the proposed clinical trial, including the trial protocol;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the institution or organisation at which the trial will be conducted, referred to as the “Approving Authority”, giving final approval for the conduct of the trial at the site, having regard to the advice from the HREC;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the investigator submitting a ‘Notification of Intent to Conduct a Clinical Trial’ form (the CTN Form) to the TGA. The CTN form must be signed by the sponsor, the principal investigator, the chairman of the HREC and a person responsible from the Approving Authority. The TGA does not review any data relating to the clinical trial however CTN trials cannot commence until the trial has been notified to the TGA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the CTX Scheme:
  
• | a sponsor submits an application to conduct a clinical trial to the TGA for evaluation and comment; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a sponsor must forward any comments made by the TGA Delegate to the HREC(s) at the sites where the trial will be conducted.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A sponsor cannot commence a trial under the CTX Scheme until written advice has been received from the TGA regarding the application and approval for the conduct of the trial has been obtained from an ethics committee and the institution at which the trial will be conducted.
 Approval for inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) is required before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed (or imported, exported or manufactured) in Australia. In order to obtain registration of the product on the ARTG, it is required that:
  
• | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the therapeutic product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | evidence is compiled which demonstrates that the manufacture of the therapeutic product complies with the principles of cGMP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | manufacturing and clinical data is derived to submit to the Advisory Committee on Prescription Medicines, which makes recommendations to the TGA as to whether or not to grant approval to include the therapeutic product in the ARTG; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an ultimate decision is made by the TGA whether to include the therapeutic product in the ARTG.
