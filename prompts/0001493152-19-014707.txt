Background
 
We are an exploration stage mining company, incorporated in Nevada.
 
The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation and is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining claims. Upon location of a commercial minable reserve, the Company expects to actively prepare the site for its extraction and enter a development stage.
 
On August 15, 2013, the Company entered into a Quitclaim Deed (the “Deed”) with Kee Nez Resources, LLC (“Grantor”), a Utah limited liability company. Pursuant to the Deed, the Grantor, in consideration of $10 and other valuable consideration, remise, release, and forever quitclaim unto the Company all of Grantor’s right, title, and interest in and to the GSR group of unpatented lode mining claims situated in Churchill Country, Nevada. As a result, the Company has obtained title to the GSR claims in August 2013.
 
The Company did not incur further expenditures on the properties during the year ended June 30, 2019 (2018: $nil) due to a lack of cash.


Employees
 
We intend to use the services of subcontractors for manual labor exploration work on our properties.
 
Employees and Employment Agreements
 
At present, we have no full-time employees. Our two officers and directors are part-time employees and each will devote about 10% of their time or four hours per week to our operation. Our officers and directors do not have employment agreements with us. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans. However, we may adopt plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our officers and directors. Marilyn Miller, one of our officers and directors, will handle our administrative duties. Because our officers and directors are inexperienced with exploration, they will hire qualified persons to perform the surveying, exploration, and excavating of the property. As of today, we have engaged private companies to review and evaluate properties mineral claims located in USA and (Mexico).
