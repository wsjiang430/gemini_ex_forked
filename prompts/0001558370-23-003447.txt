Item 1. Business
As used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, ISG, the registrant, is referred to in this Form 10-K annual report (“Form 10-K”) as the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our.”
Our Company
 Information Services Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: III) is a leading global technology research and advisory firm. A trusted business partner to more than 900 clients, including more than 75 of the top 100 enterprises in our markets, ISG is committed to helping corporations, public sector organizations and service and technology providers achieve operational excellence and faster growth. The firm specializes in digital transformation services, including automation, cloud and data analytics; sourcing advisory; managed governance and risk services; network carrier services; technology strategy and operations design; change management; market intelligence and technology research and analysis. Based in Stamford, Connecticut, ISG employs approximately 1,600 digital-ready professionals operating in more than 20 countries—a global team known for its innovative thinking, market influence, deep industry and technology expertise, and world-class research and analytical capabilities based on the industry’s most comprehensive marketplace data. For more information, visit www.isg-one.com.
Our Company was founded in 2006 with the strategic vision to become a high-growth, leading provider of information-based advisory services. We continue to believe that our vision will be realized through the acquisition, integration and successful operation of market leading brands within the data, analytics and advisory industry.
Our private and public sector clients continue to face significant technological, business and economic challenges that will continue to fuel demand for the professional services we provide. We are focused on providing unique solutions that solve for key client problems. In the private sector, for example, we believe that companies will continue to face significant challenges associated with globalization and technological innovation, including the need to decrease operating costs, increase efficiencies, compete against new market entrants and evaluate and adopt increasing numbers of emerging and transformational technologies such as cloud computing and automation. Similarly, public sector organizations at the national, regional and local levels increasingly must deal with the complex and converging issues of outdated technology systems, reduced budgets and an aging workforce. These technological challenges have only been intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting remote or hybrid work environment and, therefore, present further opportunity for ISG to assist our private and public sector clients with digital transformation services.
Overall, we believe the global marketplace dynamics at work in both the private and public sectors support growing demand for the professional services, analytics, platforms and advice ISG can provide. In this dynamic environment, the strength of our client relationships greatly depends on the quality of our advice and insight, our unique and valuable datasets, the independence of our thought leadership and the effectiveness of our people in assisting our clients to implement strategies that successfully address their most pressing operational challenges.
We are organized as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware. The current mailing address of the Company’s principal executive office is Information Services Group, Inc., 2187 Atlantic Street, Stamford, CT 06902. Our telephone number is (203) 517-3100.
Our Services
ISG specializes in digital transformation services, including automation, cloud and data analytics; sourcing advisory; managed governance and risk services; network carrier services; technology strategy and operations design; change management; market intelligence and technology research and analysis. ISG supports both private and public sector organizations to transform and optimize their operational environments. During periods of expansion or contraction, our services have helped organizations large and small, public or private, across the globe address their most complex operational issues. The functional domain experience of our experts and deep empirical data resources help clients better understand their strategic options.
The firm’s operating model, ISG NEXT, launched in the third quarter of 2020 and is aimed at extending our market leadership, enhancing growth opportunities and driving significant value for all stakeholders. Under ISG NEXT, we are pivoting from services to solutions to address our clients’ most pressing business challenges in two areas most important to them—their continuing digital transformation and getting the most from their digital investments. To meet these needs, we have formed two global client solution areas: ISG Digital, focused on developing technology, transformation, sourcing and digital solutions for clients, and ISG Enterprise, focused on helping clients manage change and optimize operations in such areas as finance, human resources (“HR”) and Procure2Pay.

Our core solutions are supported by ISG Research, with its extensive market analyses and provider evaluations, our ISG Network and Software Advisory services and our software platforms, including ISG GovernX®. We also are building more industry-specific capabilities in such areas as banking, insurance and smart manufacturing.
Every client engagement now passes through our dedicated Solution Hub to bring the best thinking, tools and capabilities to bear to solve every client challenge. Integrated solutions are then delivered through our new ISG iFlex™ global delivery model, which enables us to rapidly deploy our resources to support clients, regardless of geography or time zone.
Our Competitive Advantages
We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competition:

This enables us to maintain a trusted advisor relationship with our clients through our unbiased focus and ability to align our interests with those of our clients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Domain Expertise. Averaging over 20 years of experience, our strategic consulting teams bring a wealth of industry and domain-specific knowledge and expertise to address our clients’ most complex transformational needs.

We believe the above strengths are central to our ability to successfully advise and support our clients to address any business challenge.
Our Strategy
We intend to use our competitive strengths to develop new services and products, sustain our growth and strengthen our existing market position by pursuing the following strategies:

· | Preserve and Expand Our Market Share Positions. We expect the trend toward globalization and greater operating efficiency and technological innovation to play an increasing role in the growth in demand for our services. We plan to leverage our combined operating platform to serve the growing number of private- and public-sector organizations utilizing outside advisors when undertaking transformational projects. We are focused on growing our existing client base by offering integrated solutions that combine our multiple services and capabilities. In addition, we will seek to continue to expand our products and services and the geographic markets we serve opportunistically as global competition spurs demand for cost savings and value creation. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preserve Our Financial Positions. In its pursuit of the firm’s growth initiatives, we are committed to maintaining a strong financial position with flexibility and liquidity. We believe that maintaining a financial profile that supports an investment grade credit rating is important to this long-term strategy. The priorities for uses of available cash include payment of dividends, funding growth, repurchases of shares and debt reduction. In addition, we expect strong cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet to support the current financial strategy. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strengthen Our Industry Expertise. We have strengthened our market-facing organization to drive increased revenue around 22 global industries: Automotive, Aerospace & Defense, Banking, Chemicals, Consumer Goods, Energy & Utilities, Financial Services, Government, Health Care, Insurance, Life Sciences, Manufacturing, Media & Entertainment, Metals & Mining, Pharma/Biotech/Medical Devices, Private Equity & M&A, Public Sector & Education, Retail, Technology & Service Providers, Telecommunications, Transportation & Logistics and Travel & Hospitality. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Aggressively Expand Our Market Focus. We are seeking to drive our service portfolio and relationships with clients further into Digital Advisory Services, including Cloud Solutions, Automation, Business Advisory Services, Cybersecurity, Digital Engineering, Strategy, Data & Analytics, Transition and Organizational Change and Network Advisory. These are all areas in which we are investing additional focus to drive increased revenues and expanded relationships with clients.

· | Continue to Develop Digital Cloud Competency. There is a nexus of distinct, yet complementary, technology trends that are creating a perfect storm of disruption in the market. Among the most significant technology trends are the speed with which products get to market, large-scale digitization, the efficiency of the cloud and the immediacy with which new disruptors can become omnipresent. We continue to see clear opportunities in the execution of large-scale digital transformation – helping enterprises in executing their transformations by using their large technology platform and partner ecosystems. Increasingly, clients are taking a more agile approach, working incrementally on continuous transformation to meet rapidly changing technology and business conditions. Our offerings around cost optimization have never been more important as enterprises seek funds to invest in programs aimed at realizing their digital ambitions. The pandemic continues to accelerate client demand for, and investment in, the digital transformation services ISG provides. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISG plans to expand resources and intellectual property (“IP”) around digitization and the cloud. Processes that were once executed over analog channels (such as phone and ‘real life’) increasingly occur in a digital model. Also, digitization has elevated the profile of software. Software no longer merely supports business processes but is central to enterprise strategy. Our purpose in the digital marketplace is to be a trusted advisor, guiding our clients through digital transformation toward practical innovation of their business models, leveraging strategic partners, emerging technology and thought leadership. 
Our digital services now span a volume of offerings and have become embedded as part of our traditional transaction services. Advancements continue to be made to ‘digitize’ further our traditional services. For example, we have continued the modernization of our traditional sourcing services toward digital with the launch of ISG FutureSource™ which has brought agility and nimbleness to the process of sourcing, RFPs and contracting. ISG FutureSource is a unique and comprehensive sourcing solution that helps enterprises and public sector organizations evaluate their business requirements, identify desired outcomes, fast-track the provider identification and selection process, collaborate with providers on developing the right solution, get to a signed contract and transition operations faster than ever before.
ISG also continues to expand the capabilities of its ISG GovernX vendor compliance and risk management platform. This proprietary ISG software platform continues to drive broader insights from additional market and performance data, while delivering increased value to our clients. ISG GovernX leverages cognitive technology to automate the management of third-party supplier relationships, including contract and project lifecycles and risk management. It provides a complete, customized view of the user’s contract and supplier ecosystem to improve supplier performance, decrease spend and reduce third-party risk. Enterprises can leverage the platform to deliver up to 30 percent more value from their outsourcing spend. ISG GovernX users can easily manage new contracts and proactive renewals, make timely amendments and handle contract terminations—all on one platform. The platform delivers easy integration with other enterprise applications, such as ServiceNow, and is tightly connected to ISG Research offerings, such as benchmarks, assessments and total-cost-of-ownership evaluations. In times of crisis, ISG GovernX clients can mitigate supply chain risks and ensure business continuity by reviewing and validating their providers’ business and IT continuity plans and procedures. In 2021, ISG GovernX was enhanced with real-time third-party risk management capabilities. The new capabilities, including integrated data feeds and real-time alerts, are increasingly important as provider ecosystems continue to grow more complex, introducing more risk to the enterprise, and threats against supply-chain integrity become more diverse. In addition to monitoring the operational performance and financial viability of their suppliers, ISG GovernX helps enterprises address a range of other internal and external risks, from data security and regulatory issues, to adverse environmental, health and geopolitical events, to social responsibility, diversity and inclusion considerations. In 2021, ISG introduced a dedicated advisory and risk management service to help enterprises ensure their businesses and supply chains are in compliance with modern slavery laws. ISG helps clients develop a modern slavery framework, review and update policies across the enterprise, conduct training, map their entire supply chain and add modern slavery clauses to contract templates, while the ISG GovernX platform provides thorough, timely reporting through its automatic alert feature. 
We have also launched ISG Inform™ 2.0, an enhanced version of our data-as-a-service solution that provides benchmarking capability to track digital transformation and application development maturity and performance against industry peers. ISG Inform 2.0 provides a quantified view of the health of the user's enterprise IT landscape through a series of easy-to-read visual dashboards that display key performance indicators for infrastructure, applications and digital capabilities, compared with industry peers. Data and insights are drawn from the ISG sourcing database.
Robotic Process and Cognitive Automation technology is fundamentally reshaping the way businesses work. Automation is increasingly enabling automated 24/7/365 execution of business processes at a fraction of the cost of human equivalents, as well as the dramatic improvements in process execution and cost models.
ISG Automation offers clients a full portfolio of services, including automation assessments and strategy, proof-of-concept deployments, implementation and integration of software bots and establishment of centers of excellence to scale automation, as well as training and managed services.

● | Expand Emerging Services. The focus will be on creating repeatable methods used to drive growth of emerging services, including ISG Automation; HR Technology & Transformations; Providers-as-a-Business; ISG Platform; ISG Network Select™; ISG Hyperscaler Services; ISG Digital Engineering; ISG Cybersecurity and ISG Training-as-a-Service. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. | ISG Automation: ISG’s capabilities and service offerings include implementation services for Robotic Process and Cognitive Automation Technology. ISG Automation guides clients through the hurdles of adoption, ensuring the optimal future state with best-fit technologies. ISG Automation tailors programs to specific business needs and helps build governance that works inside the culture of our clients. The Automation market size is expected to continue to grow significantly over the next few years. Automation is fundamentally reshaping the world of Information Technology Outsourcing (“ITO”) and Business Process Outsourcing (“BPO”). Our solutions will work to optimize repetitive processes using ‘bots’ instead of human labor. ISG Automation will continue to be marketed by industry (e.g., claims processing for insurance) and by back-office functions (e.g., accounting). 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | HR Technology & Transformations: Advances in technology are transforming the business of HR. From intuitive and mobile self-service software to predictive analytics and integrated talent management suites, technological solutions are changing the way leaders acquire, develop and engage their employees. New applications, enhanced functionality and competition among software providers make it difficult to stay on top of this ever-evolving space. ISG combines deep subject matter expertise, market data and financial frameworks along with sourcing of technology and service providers to help organizations develop and execute HR technology strategies that are right for them.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Providers-as-a-Business (“PaaB”): Historically, ISG had targeted traditional service providers for these types of services, which included a combination of consulting and research solutions. These services include market intelligence, client retention programs, pursuit effectiveness, satisfaction benchmarking, go-to-market consulting and health checks. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | ISG Platform: We see growth opportunities in tool-enabling the part of consulting that solves for standard problems. The digital solutioning of ISG will reach its next level as we develop the ISG Platform, an integrated set of software-driven solutions, data and research that will allow us to increase our subscription-based recurring revenues and penetrate new market segments. ISG Inform and ISG GovernX will be at the core of the ISG Platform, as will our new set of offerings that will continue to streamline and digitize the provider selection process. In early 2022, ISG launched ISG Executive Insights™, a market intelligence and data analytics platform that addresses the challenges of managing increasingly complex supplier ecosystems. The new data-analytics-as-a-solution offering is powered by ISG’s market-leading data repository—the industry’s most comprehensive, curated database of global IT, business process and engineering outsourcing contracts—paired with ISG’s patented IT price benchmarking, market cost intelligence and other analytical tools. We continue to develop and invest in our ISG Platform, which will help us drive recurring revenues.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | ISG Network Select: This offering helps streamline and simplify how enterprises build their network solutions. It enables ISG to better meet the growing demand for such leading-edge networking solutions as software-defined networking (SD-WAN, SD-LAN), SD security services, 5G mobility, unified communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) and call center-as-a-service (CCaaS) — all critical to enterprise digital transformation. Client demand for networks that are secure, interconnected, interoperable and profitable is rising, as are concerns over security, scale, cost and the complexity of the expanding Internet of Things (“IoT”) landscape. ISG Network Select is designed to help clients find the best solutions, faster, to power their digital transformation initiatives. Clients get access to detailed and current data on their vendor and technology options, insights to help negotiate better pricing, and processes to accelerate next-generation networking solutions. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Growth Through Hyperscalers: Our cloud transformation capabilities have reached a level of maturity that allows us to explore new growth opportunities in this space. One such opportunity is serving as a channel partner for cloud hyperscalers, i.e., large public cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. ISG has hired a global executive in 2021 to drive this business, which will provide consulting services to hyperscaler customers. Total worldwide spending on cloud computing is expected to surpass $1.0 trillion in 2024, while likely to sustain a double-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 16 percent. Enterprises have migrated approximately 25 percent of their applications to the cloud, with the remaining 75 percent covering large back-office functions that are complex and challenging to move to the cloud, especially in multi-cloud environments. ISG is developing a set of core offerings that will enable hyperscalers to accelerate time to value by shifting enterprise workloads more quickly to the cloud. For hyperscaler customers, ISG will serve as an independent third party that brings transparency to solution design costs, risks and dependencies of cloud deployments. ISG will offer expertise and data to source and orchestrate the cloud transformation design process, to provision the appropriate system integrator (SI) and managed service provider (MSP) ecosystems, and to structure and manage the cloud transformation office to drive innovation and achieve tactical and strategic goals.

7. | Digital Engineering: ISG has an opportunity to develop and scale a Digital Engineering capability that meets the growing need of enterprises to integrate information technology, operational technology and engineering technology. ISG has hired a global leader to grow this business, building on our experience in Engineering Product Lifecycle Management and Digital Thread. Over the past five years, enterprise business models have been shifting from selling products as a one-time transaction to becoming more software-oriented to drive more features and functionality, shifting focus to aftermarket solutions to generate recurring revenues via services (servitization) and enhancing customer experience to increase customer acquisition and retention rates. As companies are reimagining their products and services, Digital Engineering is growing rapidly due to the increasing data and software content of products and processes. Our aim is to become an independent governance and end-to-end transformation partner including the sourcing of engineering system integrators and engineering platforms like SIEMENS and Dassault throughout each client’s digital engineering transformation journey, serving multiple industries with an initial focus on manufacturing.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | Cybersecurity: In 2022, ISG saw more than a 50% increase in the size of its global cybersecurity business and continues to see significant growth opportunities ahead. The acceleration in attacks across all industry groups has resulted in increased regulatory pressures and expanded attention at the board level, increasing the overall market outlook for cybersecurity services and solutions which is now projected to reach $262 billion by 2027. Continued adoption of Digital Transformation programs and heavy IT/IoT/OT integration and emerging legislation in the Manufacturing and Energy/Utilities sectors, coupled with similar programs and advancements in the wearables market in Life Sciences, are driving growth for ISG in this space. We will continue to leverage our heritage in strategy and sourcing while tightening the relationship between our Network Advisory, Cybersecurity, Data Analytics and Automation businesses to address emerging tech and the Secure Intelligent Connected Enterprise (SICE), expand into the emerging Cyber Risk Quantification and Human Intelligence markets and grow our consulting capabilities to maintain our position as the best agnostic cybersecurity advisory firm in the market.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


9. | Training-as-a-Service (TaaS): In partnership with the training software-as-a-service (SaaS) firm Assima, ISG has launched a subscription-based, recurring revenue service that has lowered training development costs at a major client by approximately 75 percent. Building on this success, ISG plans to offer training as an ongoing, outsourced managed service for organizations with limited resources and growing demand for training content. These organizations are typically looking for longer-term training support to address the needs of an evolving workforce. ISG TaaS uses an agile approach with rapid content development tools to accelerate training content throughout. Services include training advisory, analysis, strategy, development, delivery support and learning assessment.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand “Recurring Revenue Streams.” These include such annuity-based ISG offerings as ISG GovernX, Research, Software-as-a-Subscription, ISG Inform and the multi-year Public Sector contracts. All are characterized by subscriptions (i.e., renewal centric as opposed to project centric revenue streams) or multi-year contracts. As companies begin to recognize the importance of managing the post-sourcing transaction period, managed services have emerged as a revenue driver for the firm, with our offerings delivered through multi-year managed services contracts. We believe that our experience with outsourcing transactions and software implementation initiatives make us uniquely equipped to provide research insights and direct support to help our clients manage their transformational projects or act as a third-party administrator. We will continue to pursue opportunities to leverage our experience to make research and managed services an even greater revenue generator for us. The U.S. public sector, particularly state governments, local municipalities and higher education, presents a significant opportunity to ISG. Systems are typically outdated, maintenance is expensive and the workforce charged with maintenance is aging. There is a need to refurbish systems to reduce the cost of operations (particularly because governments’ tax revenues are under pressure). We are well-positioned as a third party, objective advisory group with no affiliation to the software providers. ISG will continue to invest in the digitization of these services, driving increased automation, greater profitability and even more value for our clients.

· | Consider Acquisition and Other Growth Opportunities. The business services, information and advisory market is highly fragmented. We believe we are well-positioned to leverage our leading market positions and strong brand recognition to expand through acquisitions and other growth opportunities. Acquiring firms with complementary services and products allows us to further develop and broaden our service offerings and domain expertise. We will consider and may pursue opportunities to enter into joint ventures and to buy or combine with other businesses.

Our Proprietary Data Assets and Market Intelligence
One of our core assets is the information, data, analytics, methodologies and other intellectual property the Company possesses. This intellectual property underpins the independent nature of our operational assessments, strategy development, deal structuring, negotiation and other consulting services we provide to our clients.
With each engagement we conduct, we enhance both the quantity and quality of the intellectual property we employ on behalf of our clients, thus providing a continuous, evolving and unique source of information, data and analytics.

This intellectual property is proprietary, and we rely on multiple legal and contractual provisions and devices to protect our intellectual property rights. We recognize the value of our intellectual property and vigorously defend it. As a result, the Company maintains strict policies and procedures regarding ownership, use and protection with all parties, including our employees.
Clients
We operate in over 20 countries and across numerous industries. Our private sector clients operate primarily in the manufacturing, banking and financial services, insurance, health sciences, energy and utilities and consumer services industries. Our private sector clients are primarily large businesses ranked in the Forbes Global 2000 companies annually. Our public sector clients are primarily state and local governments (cities and counties) and authorities (airport and transit) in the United States and national and provincial government units in the United Kingdom, Italy and Australia.
Competition
Competition in the sourcing, data, information and advisory market is primarily driven by independence and objectivity, expertise, possession of relevant benchmarking data, breadth of service capabilities, reputation and price. We compete with other sourcing advisors, research firms, strategy consultants and sourcing service providers. A significant number of independent sourcing and advisory firms offer similar services. We believe we set ourselves apart with our data repository of recent, comparable transactions and benchmarking data, our depth of experience and our sourcing and technology implementation expertise, all of which are critical to implementing and managing successful transformation projects for business and governments. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 1,599 people worldwide.
Our employee base includes executive management, service leads, partners, directors, advisors, analysts, technical specialists and functional support staff.
We recruit advisors from service providers and consulting firms with direct operational experience. These advisors leverage extensive practical expertise derived from experiences in corporate leadership, consulting, research, financial analysis, contract negotiations and operational service delivery.
All employees are required to execute confidentiality, conflict of interest and intellectual property agreements as a condition of employment. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees.
Our voluntary advisor turnover rate has ranged between 11% and 15% over the last three years.
Human Capital Management
ISG strives to employ the brightest, most innovative people in the industry, so that we can provide world-class solutions to our clients. Employees at ISG are anchored in our core values, which include trust, integrity, respect, diversity, passion, entrepreneurship, balance and mentorship.
Our approximately 1,600 employees, located in over 20 countries with more than one-fourth in the United States, perform a variety of different roles. We are participants in the competitive research and advisory industries. Attracting, developing and retaining talented people in advisory, research and other positions is critical to executing on our strategy. Our ability to compete effectively depends upon a number of factors, including learning opportunities, compensation/benefits, work environment and career opportunities. To make this happen, we have certain programs, training, policies and practices in place including the following:
Diversity/Inclusion
ISG believes a key to our success is our value of diverse backgrounds, experiences and cultures. Our employees’ function within a collaborative community that welcomes varied ideas and styles. These diverse perspectives produce enhanced results for our clients and result in a preferred place to work.
We exhibit our commitment to diversity and inclusion through our hiring practices, opportunities for learning and advancement and the distribution of rewards. Through efforts such as our Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Awareness (IDEA) team and Women-In-Digital industry group, we are able to help in the identification and advancement of diverse talent. While we have made progress in our workforce diversity representation, we seek to continually improve in this area.

ISG WorkLife
We have also introduced ISG WorkLife, which is a series of progressive, best practice, next-generation HR offerings designed to improve the quality of our work-life experience, while helping us achieve our firm-wide objectives. ISG believes this will help us attract and retain productive talent. Some of the key offerings here include:

● | ISG Cares, our enhanced volunteering program, which, among other things, provides employees paid time off to attend to charitable pursuits.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ISG Academy, our global learning and development program.
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | ISG Aspire, our global mentoring program.
--+------------------------------------------


● | ISG iRefer, which allows the firm to attract talent through employee referrals, which earn referral bonuses.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ISG iTime, which provides flexible paid time off arrangements for employees in certain countries.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We understand that employees have varied interests both in and outside of the workplace. These programs, and others under ISG WorkLife, provide employees with the opportunity to pursue these activities. This allows us to attract and retain productive employees and enhance diverse perspectives.
Environmental Social and Governance (ESG, formerly referred to as CSR)
The ISG Environmental Social and Governance program was developed with corporate commitment and accountability on a global level. The program has oversight and executive support to drive real, positive change in alignment with our value and policies, ultimately enabling us to maximize impact and value.
Our ISG Go Green program speaks to the Environmental pillar of ESG. This program seeks to reduce our carbon footprint via awareness and education initiatives that share green practices for ISG employees in both virtual and physical offices. Additionally, ISG is developing measurable carbon reduction best practices that align with our goals for sustainable business operations. Since 2021, we have offset the carbon generated by ISG employee travel and continue to seek ways to pivot to green energy for our physical locations. Our environmental work is centered around three core concepts: compliance with eco-friendly laws and best practices, prevention of waste, pollution and carbon emissions and continuous, measurable improvement. 
The IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Awareness) program is the foundation for our Social pillar. Beyond our core Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) activities, ISG has sub-groups that devote focus to uplifting women in digital, maintaining equitable recruitment, building our supplier diversity and volunteering through our global ISG Cares team. At ISG, we do not just accept difference — we celebrate it, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our clients and our communities. We commit to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives and skills. ISG is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace, and we are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. Our work in the social pillar is based on ISG values of trust, integrity, respect and diversity, made tangible in our business practices, modern slavery statement and fair labor policies.
For the Governance pillar, ISG has a well-established set of policies, governing bodies and independent validation measures. ISG is governed on a day-to-day basis by our internal international executive board, which meets weekly. ISG also receives governance and support from an external board of directors. We maintain procedures, policies and codes of conduct around ethical business practices, whistleblowing, suppliers, data protection, information security, privacy, confidentiality, employee comportment and travel. With regard to cybersecurity, we regularly provide training, reporting and scans in compliance with our ISO-27001 certifications and best practices. Every year, our employees attest to reviewing our global policies via digital signature.
Learning
ISG’s success depends on the knowledge and productivity of its employees. To that end, the firm invests a significant amount of time and money into providing development opportunities. Our ISG Academy is robust in offering learning in such topics specific to the employee’s industry and functional areas, leadership and people management, certifications and software and technical skills, among others. In 2022, most learning was virtual; there were over 700 digital certified professionals that participated in various sessions, devoting a total of more than 30,000 hours to learning and development.
