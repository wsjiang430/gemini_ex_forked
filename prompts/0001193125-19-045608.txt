History 
 AT&T, formerly known as SBC Communications Inc. (SBC), was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold AT&T Corp.s (ATTC) local telephone companies. On January 1, 1984, we were spun-off from ATTC pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent publicly-traded telecommunications services provider. At formation, we primarily operated in five southwestern states. 
 Following our formation, we have expanded our footprint and operations by acquiring various businesses, most significantly: 
 
· | Our subsidiaries merged with Pacific Telesis Group in 1997, Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation in 1998 and Ameritech Corporation in 1999, thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) into a total of 13 states.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In November 2005 we merged one of our subsidiaries with ATTC, creating one of the worlds leading telecommunications providers. In connection with the merger, we changed the name of our company from SBC Communications Inc. to AT&T Inc.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In December 2006 we merged one of our subsidiaries with BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth) making us the ILEC in an additional nine states. With the BellSouth acquisition, we also acquired BellSouths 40 percent economic interest in AT&T Mobility LLC (AT&T Mobility), formerly Cingular Wireless LLC, resulting in 100 percent ownership of AT&T Mobility.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In 2014, we completed the acquisition of wireless provider Leap Wireless International, Inc. and sold our ILEC operations in Connecticut, which we had previously acquired in 1998.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In 2015, we acquired wireless properties in Mexico, and in July 2015 we acquired DIRECTV, a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the United States and Latin America.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In 2018, we completed the acquisition of Time Warner Inc. (Time Warner), a leader in media and entertainment that operates the Turner, Home Box Office (HBO) and Warner Bros. business units. We also acquired Otter Media Holdings and advertising platform AppNexus.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Areas of Focus 
 With continuing advances in technology and in response to changing demands from our customers, in recent years we have focused on providing enhanced broadband, video and voice services. We are also capitalizing on data insights from our direct-to-consumer relationships and our premium video and digital advertising inventory to provide advertising that matters. Our acquisitions over the past few years and our continued investment in a premier network experience make our customers lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry. In 2019, we plan to focus on the areas discussed below. 
Communications 
 As the communications industry continues to move toward internet-based technologies that are capable of blending wireline, satellite and wireless products, we are offering services that take advantage of these more sophisticated technologies. In particular, our focus is on expanding our high-speed internet and video offerings and on developing IP-based services that allow customers to integrate their home or business wireline services with their mobile service. During 2019, we will continue to develop and provide unique integrated video, mobile and broadband solutions. We believe offering integrated services facilitates our customers desire to view video anywhere on demand and encourages customer retention. 
Wireless Service 
 We are experiencing rapid growth in data usage as consumers are demanding seamless access across their wireless and wired devices, and as more and more machines are being connected to the internet. We expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities to offer a variety of wireless communications services. 
 Our 4G LTE technology covers over 400 million people in North America, and, in the United States, we cover all major metropolitan areas and almost 325 million people with our LTE technology. Our 3G network provides services to customers using older handsets and connected devices. We are contemplating the redeployment of spectrum currently used for our 3G services and project that we will discontinue service on our 3G network in early 2022, and will manage this process consistent with previous network upgrades. As of December 31, 2018, about 11% of our postpaid subscribers were using 3G 
 
2 


 AT&T Inc. 
 

 handsets, and we expect them to transition to newer technologies. We do not expect this transition to have a material impact on our consolidated operating results. 
 We are currently beginning the deployment of the latest wireless technology (5G) in multiple U.S. cities. In late 2018, we were the first U.S. company to introduce mobile 5G service in parts of 12 cities and plan to expand that deployment nationwide by early 2020. The introduction of 5G service is largely dependent on the development of 5G standards. To that end, we are one of the top North American wireless carrier contributors into 3rd Generation Partnership Projects (3GPP) work on 5G standards. We have been awarded the contract to provide national coverage for emergency personnel (first responders) by the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet), which gives us access to a nationwide low band 20 MHz of spectrum. We will continue to invest in our wireless network as we look to provide future service offerings and participate in technologies such as 5G and millimeter-wave bands. The increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with 5G technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of data services. We expect that 5G will enhance our customers entire connected experience and not just provide faster speeds. 
 As the wireless industry has matured, future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative data services on a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations. We continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity, as well as obtaining additional spectrum that meets our long-term needs. We have participated in recent FCC spectrum auctions and have been redeploying spectrum previously used for more basic services to support more advanced mobile internet services. 
 Internet Protocol (IP) Technology IP is generally used to describe the transmission of data, which can include voice (called voice over IP or VoIP), using a software-based technology rather than a traditional telephone network. Software-based technology presents cost-savings and growth opportunities by using bandwidth more efficiently than a legacy copper wire network and by improving our ability to provide data and video services to both fixed locations and mobile devices. We are rapidly converting to a software-based network and managing the migration of wireline customers to services using IP; we expect to continue this transition through at least 2020. Software-based technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). This network approach, of which we are a global leader in our commitment to virtualize 75% of our network by 2020, delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of next-generation technology over the traditional, hardware-intensive network approach. Our virtualized network will be able to support next-generation applications like 5G and IP-based services quickly and efficiently. 
 Media 
 We produce and distribute high-quality video content to take advantage of growing global demand. Our media businesses use their strong brands, distinctive intellectual property and global scale to produce and distribute quality content. As the television industry continues to evolve from a distribution system using satellite and cable offerings to individual streaming video services, we are well-positioned to address and capitalize on these changes, but we face risks and new sources of competition associated with these developments. We plan in 2019 to continue launching more personalized services offered directly to consumers. 
Advertising 
 Our Xandr segment relies on using data (on an anonymous basis) from our more than 170 million customer relationships, to develop digital advertising that is more relevant to consumers. Advertisers are interested in capitalizing on our broad distribution and ability to offer more precise marketing to customers through a digital platform. We also are expanding relationships with other broadband and video providers to use our digital platform to reach their audiences. This segment experienced rapid growth in 2018, and we believe this growth will continue in 2019. 
Latin America 
 We believe that the wireless model in the U.S., with accelerating demand for mobile internet service and the associated economic benefits, will be repeated around the world as companies invest in high-speed mobile networks. Due in part to changes in the legal and regulatory framework in Mexico in 2015, we acquired Mexican wireless operations to establish a seamless, cross-border North American wireless network covering over 400 million people and businesses in the United States and Mexico. During 2018, we largely completed building a 4G LTE network in Mexico which covers approximately 100 million people and businesses.

BUSINESS OPERATIONS 
 OPERATING SEGMENTS 
 Our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We analyze our operating segments based on segment contribution, which consists of operating income, excluding acquisition-related costs and other significant items, and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates for investments managed within each operating segment. We have four reportable segments: (1) Communications, (2) WarnerMedia, (3) Latin America and (4) Xandr. 
 Additional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading Segment Results on pages 21 through 32 and in Note 4 of the Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2). 
 COMMUNICATIONS 
 Our Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom, video and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. or in U.S. territories and businesses globally. Our Communications services and products are marketed under the AT&T, Cricket, AT&T PREPAID and DIRECTV brand names. The Communications segment provided approximately 84% of 2018 segment operating revenues and 84% of our 2018 total segment contribution. This segment contains the Mobility, Entertainment Group and Business Wireline business units. 
 Mobility  Our Mobility business unit provides nationwide wireless services to consumers and wholesale and resale wireless subscribers located in the United States or U.S. territories by utilizing our network to provide voice and data services, including high-speed internet over wireless devices. We classify our subscribers as either postpaid, prepaid, connected device or reseller. At December 31, 2018, we served 153 million Mobility subscribers, including 77 million postpaid, 17 million prepaid, 8 million reseller and 51 million connected devices. Our Mobility business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment. 
Wireless Services 
 We offer a comprehensive range of high-quality nationwide wireless voice and data communications services in a variety of pricing plans to meet the communications needs of targeted customer categories. Our wireless services also include advertising revenues generated from the subscriber relationships. 
 Wireless data services continue to be a growing area for this segment, representing an increasing share of overall subscriber revenue. We are experiencing solid growth in this area as an increasing number of our subscribers have upgraded their handsets to more advanced integrated devices, are using data-centric devices such as tablets and connected cars, and are utilizing the network to connect and control physical devices using embedded computing systems and/or software, commonly called the Internet of Things (IoT). We offer plans that include unlimited features allowing for the sharing of voice, text and data across multiple devices, which attracts subscribers from other providers and minimize subscriber churn. Customers in our connected device category (e.g., users of session-based tablets, monitoring devices and automobile systems) generally purchase those devices from third-party suppliers that buy data access supported by our network. We continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and application developers to further capitalize on the continued growing demand for wireless data services. 
 We also offer nationwide wireless voice and data communications to certain customers who prefer to pay in advance. These services are offered under the Cricket and AT&T PREPAIDSM brands and are typically monthly prepaid services. 
 Equipment 
 We sell a wide variety of handsets, wirelessly enabled computers (e.g., tablets and notebooks) and wireless data cards manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services. We also sell accessories, such as carrying cases and hands-free devices. We sell through our own company-owned stores, agents and third-party retail stores. Like other wireless service providers, we have historically provided postpaid contract subscribers substantial equipment subsidies to initiate, renew or upgrade service. We have now largely eliminated these subsidies and provide our customers with more service options, the ability to purchase handsets on an installment basis and the opportunity to bring their own device. With the elimination of most handset subsidies, our subscribers have been bringing their own devices or retaining their handsets for longer periods, which could impact future upgrade activity. 
 Entertainment Group  Our Entertainment Group business unit provides video, internet, voice communication and interactive and targeted advertising services to customers in the United States and U.S. territories by utilizing our IP-based

 AT&T Inc. 
 

 and copper wired network and/or our satellite technology. Our Entertainment Group business unit revenue includes the following categories: video entertainment, high-speed internet, legacy voice and data services and other service and equipment. 
 Video Entertainment 
 Video entertainment revenues are comprised of subscription and advertising revenues. We offer video entertainment services using satellite and IP-based technologies (referred to as linear) as well as a streaming option that does not require either satellite or wired IP services (referred to as over-the-top or OTT). Our offerings are structured to provide customers with the best video experience both inside and outside of the home by offering subscribers attractive programming and state-of-the-art technology. Due to the rising cost of programming as well as higher costs to acquire new subscribers in an increasingly competitive industry, it is even more important to distinguish and elevate our video entertainment experience for our new and existing customers. 
 We provide approximately 24 million subscribers with access to hundreds of channels of digital-quality video entertainment and audio programming. In addition, our video entertainment subscribers have the ability to use the internet and/or our mobile applications from smartphones and tablets to view authorized content, search program listings and schedule DVR recordings. 
 We believe it is critical that we continue to extend our brand leadership as a premium pay-TV provider in the marketplace by providing the best video experience both at home and on mobile devices. With annual cash of over $4,000 million historically generated from the business, including synergies resulting from our DIRECTV acquisition, we are focused on providing content to subscribers when and where they want it and believe that our flexible platform that uses a combination of satellite, IP-based, and cloud infrastructure with a broadband and wireless connection is the most efficient way to transport that content. Through this integrated approach, we are able to optimize the use of storage in the home as well as in the cloud, while also providing a seamless service for consumers across screens and locations. 
 High-Speed Internet 
 We offer broadband and internet services to 13.7 million residential subscribers. Our IP-based technology provides high-speed internet services. 
 Legacy Voice and Data Services 
 Revenues from our traditional voice services continue to decline as customers switch to wireless or VoIP services provided by us, cable companies or other internet-based providers. We have responded by offering packages of combined voice and data services, including broadband and video, and intend to continue this strategy during 2019. 
 Business Wireline  Our Business Wireline business unit provides services to business customers, including multinational corporations, small and mid-sized businesses, governmental and wholesale customers. Our Business Wireline business unit revenue includes the following categories: strategic services, legacy voice and data services, and other services and equipment. 
 Strategic Services 
Strategic services (previously known as strategic business services) are our most advanced business solutions. Our strategic services are made up of Strategic Data, Strategic Voice, Security and Cloud Solutions. Strategic Data services include our Virtual Private Networks (VPN), AT&T Dedicated Internet (ADI), and Ethernet and Broadband Services. These offerings allow our customers to create and manage their own internal networks and to access external data networks. Our Strategic Voice services include both premises-based Voice over IP (VOIP) and cloud-based voice solutions. Additionally, we provide collaboration services that utilize our IP infrastructure and allow our customers to utilize the most advanced technology to improve their productivity. We continue to reconfigure our wireline network to take advantage of the latest technologies and services. We have developed AT&T FlexWare, a service that relies on our SDN and NFV to enhance business customers digital agility in a rapidly evolving environment. We sell Cyber-Security services to our customers providing state-of-the-art security solutions like Threat Management, Intrusion Detection and other business security applications. We also offer Cloud Solutions and Wi-Fi services. Due to developing technology, our most advanced business solutions are subject to change periodically. We review and evaluate our strategic service offerings annually, which may result in an updated definition and the recast of our historical financial information to conform to the current period presentation. Any modifications will be reflected in the first quarter. 
Legacy Voice and Data Services 
 Voice services include services provided to business and governmental customers, either directly or through wholesale arrangements with other service providers. Our circuit-based, traditional data products include switched and dedicated 
 
5 


 AT&T Inc. 
 

 transport services that allow customers to transmit data at high speeds, as well as access to the internet using a DSL connection. 
 Other Services 
 Other service revenues include Outsourcing, Managed Services, Professional Services and Equipment. These services are typically large customer specific contracts where we provide many services including LAN & WAN management, consulting and other management services. 
 Additional information on our Communications segment is contained in the Annual Report in the Overview section beginning on page 22 and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2). 
 WARNERMEDIA 
 Our WarnerMedia segment is comprised of leading media and entertainment businesses that principally develop, produce and distribute feature films, television content, and other content globally; operate cable networks, premium pay television and OTT services domestically and internationally; and operate digital media properties. The WarnerMedia segment includes Time Warner operations for the period subsequent to our June 14, 2018 acquisition and provided approximately 11% of 2018 segment operating revenues and 15% of our 2018 total segment contribution. This segment consists primarily of the Turner, Home Box Office and Warner Bros. business units. 
 Turner  The Turner business unit operates television networks and related properties that offer branded news, entertainment, sports and kids multi-platform content for consumers around the world. In the U.S., its networks and related businesses and brands include TNT; TBS; Adult Swim; truTV; Turner Classic Movies; Turner Sports; Cartoon Network; Boomerang; and CNN. Turners digital properties include Bleacher Report and the CNN digital network. Digital properties Turner manages or operates for sports leagues include NBA.com, NBA Mobile, NCAA.com and PGA.com. 
 Turner licenses programming to affiliates that have contracted to receive and distribute the programming to subscribers, sells advertising on its networks and its digital properties owned or managed for other companies, and licenses its original programming and brands and characters for consumer products and other business ventures. Turner revenue includes the following categories: subscription, advertising and content and other. 
 Subscription 
 Turners programming is primarily distributed by affiliates and is available to subscribers of the affiliates for viewing live and on demand on television and on various internet-connected devices through the affiliates services and Turners network apps. 
 Turners license agreements with its affiliates are typically multi-year arrangements that provide for annual service fee increases and have fee arrangements that are generally related to the number of subscribers served by the affiliate and the networks provided to the affiliate by Turner. 
 Advertising 
 Advertising arrangements for its networks generally have terms of one year or less. In the U.S., the advertising revenues depend on the size and demographics of a networks audience delivered to an advertiser, the number of units of time sold and the price per unit. Turner sells some of its advertising inventory in the upfront market in advance each year and other inventory in the scatter market closer to the time a program airs. Outside the U.S., advertising is generally sold at a fixed rate for the unit of time sold, determined by the time of day and network. 
 Turners digital properties consist of its own assets and those it manages and/or operates for sports leagues where Turner holds the related programming rights. The CNN digital network is the leading digital news destination, based on the number of average monthly domestic multi-platform unique visitors and videostarts for the year ended December 31, 2018. Turners Bleacher Report is the leading digital sports publisher across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter (based on data for the year ended December 31, 2018 sourced from CrowdTangle). 
 Content and Other 
 Turner provides services for other business ventures and licenses certain owned original programming to international territories and to subscription VOD (referred to as SVOD) services. Turner also licenses its brands and characters for consumer products.

 AT&T Inc. 
 

Home Box Office  Our Home Box Office business unit owns and operates leading multichannel premium pay television services, HBO and Cinemax. Our Home Box Office business unit revenue includes the following categories: subscription and content and other. 
Subscription 
 In the U.S., HBO and Cinemax programming is available to subscribers of traditional affiliates for viewing live and on demand on television and various internet-connected devices. Home Box Office has entered into arrangements with a number of digital distributors to provide their subscribers access to the HBO and Cinemax services and programming on digital platforms and devices. HBO NOW, a domestic stand-alone OTT service, is provided through digital distributors, such as Apple, Google, Amazon and Roku, as well as by some affiliates. At December 31, 2018, Home Box Office was the most widely distributed domestic multichannel premium pay television service. At December 31, 2018, after including the negative effect of a carriage dispute, Home Box Office had approximately 50 million domestic subscribers, including HBO NOW. 
 Home Box Offices domestic license agreements with affiliates are typically multi-year arrangements that provide for annual service fee increases and marketing support. The relationship between subscriber totals and the amount of revenues earned under Home Box Offices license agreements depends on the specific terms of the applicable agreement, which may include basic and/or pay television subscriber thresholds, volume discounts and other performance-based discounts. 
 Internationally, Home Box Office uses one or more of the following distribution models: premium pay and basic tier television services distributed by traditional affiliates, licensing of programming to third-party providers, OTT services distributed by third parties and direct-to-consumer OTT services. HBO- and Cinemax-branded premium pay, basic tier television and/or OTT services are distributed in over 70 countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia. Home Box Office had approximately 90 million international premium pay, basic tier television service and OTT service subscribers at December 31, 2018, including subscribers through Home Box Offices unconsolidated joint ventures. The amount of its international subscription revenues depends on factors such as basic and/or pay television subscriber thresholds, performance-based or volume discounts, negotiated minimum guarantees or flat-fee arrangements. 
 Content and Other 
 Home Box Office licenses its original programming to television networks and OTT services in over 150 countries, including arrangements under which it licenses programming to television networks that are branded as the Home of HBO in countries such as the U.K., Australia, France and Germany and as HBO Canada in Canada. HBOs original programming also is available to customers in both physical and digital formats in the U.S. and various international regions through a wide variety of digital storefronts and traditional retailers. 
 Warner Bros.  Our Warner Bros. business unit is one of the largest television and film studios in the world. Its businesses consist principally of the production, distribution and licensing of television programming and feature films and the distribution of home entertainment product in both physical and digital formats, as well as the production and distribution of games and consumer product and brand licensing. 
 At December 31, 2018, Warner Bros. vast content library consists of more than 100,000 hours of programming, including over 8,600 feature films and 5,000 television programs comprised of tens of thousands of individual episodes. 
 The home entertainment industry has been undergoing significant changes as it transitions from the distribution of film and television content via physical formats to digital formats. Consumer spending on home entertainment product in physical formats has declined as a result of several factors, including consumers shifting to OTT service subscriptions and, to a lesser degree, digital purchases and transactional VOD rentals of content; changing retailer initiatives and strategies (e.g., reduction in floor space devoted to home entertainment product in physical formats); retail store closures; increasing competition for consumer discretionary time and spending; and piracy. Consumer spending on film and television content in higher margin digital formats represents an increasing share of total home entertainment consumer spending in recent years, but has not offset declines in consumer spending on home entertainment product in physical formats. 
 In response to these dynamics, Warner Bros. has been focusing on increasing the more profitable electronic sell-through and transactional digital VOD rentals of its film and television content and participates in a variety of initiatives that are designed to make digital ownership more compelling for consumers. 
 Our Warner Bros. business unit revenue includes the following categories: theatrical product, television product, and games and other. 
 
7 


 AT&T Inc. 
 

Theatrical Product 
 Theatrical product consists of (1) rental fees paid by movie theaters for the initial exhibition of feature films produced (or co-produced) and/or distributed by Warner Bros., (2) licensing fees paid by television networks, premium pay television services and OTT services for the exhibition of feature films produced or co-produced by Warner Bros. and (3) revenues from the distribution of Warner Bros. and other companies feature films in physical and digital formats. Our feature films also support Warner Bros. key brands and franchises, which helps generate consumer product and brand licensing revenues based on Warner Bros. films and characters. 
 Warner Bros. was one of the top film studios in global box office receipts in 2018 and has been a leading film studio in domestic box office receipts for the past ten years. 
 Television Product 
 Television product consists of (1) fees for the initial broadcast of Warner Bros. television programming on U.S. broadcast and cable television networks and premium pay television and OTT services, (2) fees for the airing or other distribution of its television programming after its initial broadcast in secondary U.S. distribution channels (such as basic cable networks, local television stations and OTT services), (3) fees for the international distribution of Warner Bros. television programming for free-to-air television, basic tier television services, premium pay television services and OTT services, and (4) revenues from the sale of the television programming of Warner Bros. and other companies in physical and digital formats. Our television programming also supports Warner Bros. key brands and franchises, which helps generate consumer product and brand licensing revenues based on the programming for years beyond the initial airing of the programming on television. 
 Warner Bros. was a leading producer of primetime television series for the U.S. broadcast networks for the 2018-2019 television season, producing 35 series. In addition, Warner Bros. licenses its U.S. programming globally. 
 Games and Other 
 Warner Bros. develops, publishes and distributes games, including mobile and console games. Its games are based on intellectual property owned or licensed by Warner Bros. (including DC Entertainment properties, Harry Potter and Mortal Kombat). 
 Additional information on our WarnerMedia segment is contained in the Annual Report in the Overview section beginning on page 27 and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2). 
 LATIN AMERICA 
 Our Latin America segment provides entertainment services in Latin America and wireless services in Mexico. The Latin America segment provided approximately 4% of 2018 segment operating revenues. Our Latin America services and products are marketed under the AT&T, DIRECTV, SKY and Unefon brand names. This segment contains the Vrio and Mexico business units. 
 Vrio  Video entertainment services are provided to primarily residential customers using satellite technology. We are a leading provider of digital television services throughout Latin America, providing a wide selection of local and international digital-quality video entertainment and audio programming under the DIRECTV and SKY brands. We provide one of the most extensive collections of programming available in the Latin America pay-TV market, including HD sports video content and the most innovative interactive technology across the region. In addition, we have the unique ability to sell superior offerings of our differentiated products and services on a continent-wide basis with an operational cost structure that we believe to be lower than that of our competition. 
 We have approximately 14 million video subscribers in Latin America. Our business encompasses pay television services with satellite operations serving Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela and parts of the Caribbean. Our operations also include our 41% equity method investment in Innova, S. de R.L. de C.V., or SKY Mexico. Sky Mexico financial results are accounted for as an equity-method investment. 
 Mexico  We utilize our regional and national wireless networks in Mexico to provide consumer and business customers with wireless data and voice communication services. We divide our revenue into the following categories: wireless service and wireless equipment. 
 We offer postpaid and prepaid wireless services in Mexico to approximately 18 million subscribers under the AT&T and Unefon brands. Postpaid services allow for (1) no annual service contract for subscribers who bring their own device or

 XANDR 
 Our Xandr segment relies on using data from our more than 170 million customer relationships (on an anonymous basis), to develop digital advertising that is more relevant to consumers. The Xandr segment provided approximately 1% of 2018 segment operating revenues and 3% of our 2018 total segment contribution. Advertisers are interested in capitalizing on our broad distribution and ability to offer more precise marketing to customers through a digital platform. We also are expanding relationships with other broadband and video providers to use our digital platform to reach their audiences. This segment experienced rapid growth in 2018, and we believe this growth will continue in 2019. 
 Additional information on our Xandr segment is contained in the Annual Report in the Overview section beginning on page 32 and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 Wireless communications providers must be licensed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within defined geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCCs rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the high-quality, innovative services our customers demand. Wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period, typically ten years, and we must seek renewal of these licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Additionally, while wireless communications providers prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation, the federal government and various states are considering new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services. 
 The Communications Act of 1934 and other related acts give the FCC broad authority to regulate the U.S. operations of our satellite services, which are licensed by the FCC, and some of WarnerMedias businesses are also subject to obligations under the Communications Act and related FCC regulations. In addition, states representing a majority of our local service access lines have adopted legislation that enables us to provide IP-based video service through a single statewide or state-approved franchise (as opposed to the need to acquire hundreds or even thousands of municipal-approved franchises) to offer a competitive video product. We also are supporting efforts to update and improve regulatory treatment for retail services. Regulatory reform and passage of legislation is uncertain and depends on many factors. 
 In February 2015, the FCC released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services, subject to Title II of the Communications Act. This order, which represented a departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent, significantly expanded the FCCs authority to regulate broadband internet access services, as well as internet interconnection arrangements. AT&T and several other parties appealed the FCCs order. In June 2016, a divided panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals upheld the FCCs rules by a 2-1 vote, and petitions for rehearing en banc were denied in May 2017. Petitions for a writ of Certiorari at the U.S. Supreme Court remain pending. Meanwhile, in December 2017, the FCC reversed its 2015 decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services and repealing most of the rules that were adopted in 2015. In lieu of broad conduct prohibitions, the order requires internet service providers to disclose information about their network practices and terms of service, including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization. Several parties, including several state Attorneys General, net neutrality advocacy groups and others, have appealed the FCCs December 2017 decision. Those appeals, which initially were consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, were transferred at the request of the parties to the D.C. Circuit. Although the FCC order expressly preempted inconsistent state or local measures, a number of states are considering or have adopted legislation that would reimpose the very rules the FCC repealed, and in some cases, establish additional requirements that go beyond the FCCs February 2015 order. Additionally, some state governors have issued executive orders that effectively re-impose the repealed requirements. Suits have recently been filed concerning laws in California and Vermont, and other lawsuits are possible. We will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules for the internet. 
 On April 20, 2017, the FCC adopted an order that maintains light touch pricing regulation of packet-based services like Ethernet and extends this light touch approach to high-speed TDM transport services and to most of our TDM channel termination services, based on the application of a competitive market test for such services. For those services that do not qualify for light touch regulation, the order allows companies to offer volume and term discounts, as well as contract tariffs. Several parties appealed the FCCs decision. In August 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit largely upheld the FCC decision, but found that the FCC had not provided adequate notice of the possibility that it might apply light touch regulation to all transport services. The FCC has since remedied that notice deficiency and has proposed to reinstate its light touch approach for transport services. 
 Privacy-related legislation has been considered in a number of states. The policy environment is complex and rapidly evolving. Legislative and regulatory action could result in increased costs of compliance, claims against broadband internet access service providers, content owners and others, and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data. In June 2018, the State of California enacted comprehensive privacy legislation that gives California consumers the right to know what personal information is being collected about them, to know whether and to whom it is sold or disclosed, and to access and request deletion of this information. Subject to certain exceptions, it also gives consumers the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information. The law applies the same rules to all companies that collect consumer information. The new law could significantly affect how data markets operate and will impose implementation costs and challenges. We will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules of the internet, including a federal privacy framework.

Our ILEC subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments, which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services, including local, long-distance and network access services, provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law. Some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings. These subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to intercarrier compensation, interconnection, and interstate and international rates and services, including interstate access charges. Access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to reimburse our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers. 
 WarnerMedia creates, owns and distributes intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks and licenses of intellectual property. To protect its intellectual property, WarnerMedia relies on a combination of laws and license agreements. Outside the U.S., laws and regulations relating to intellectual property protection and the effective enforcement of these laws and regulations vary greatly from country to country. The European Union Commission is pursuing legislative and regulatory initiatives that could impair Warner Bros. current country-by-country licensing approach in the European Union. Piracy, particularly of digital content, continues to threaten revenues from WarnerMedias products and services, as well as revenues from our pay TV business, and we work to limit that threat through a combination of approaches, including technological and legislative solutions. Outside the U.S., various laws and regulations, as well as trade agreements with the U.S., also apply to the distribution or licensing of feature films for exhibition in theaters and on broadcast and cable networks. For example, in certain countries, including China, laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year. 
 Our subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided. 
 Additional information relating to regulation of our subsidiaries is contained in the Annual Report under the headings Operating Environment Overview beginning on page 37 and Regulatory Developments beginning on page 39 and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2). 
 IMPORTANCE, DURATION AND EFFECT OF LICENSES 
 Certain of our subsidiaries own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property necessary to conduct business. Many of our subsidiaries also hold government-issued licenses or franchises to provide wireline, satellite or wireless services. Additional information relating to regulation affecting those rights is contained in the Annual Report under the heading Operating Environment Overview, beginning on page 37, and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2). We actively pursue patents, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property within the United States and abroad. We maintain a significant global portfolio of patents, trademarks and service mark registrations. We have also entered into agreements that permit other companies, in exchange for fees and rights, and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to utilize certain of our patents, trademarks and service marks. As we transition our network from a switch-based network to an IP, software-based network, we have increasingly entered into licensing agreements with software developers. 
 We periodically receive offers from third parties to obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also receive notices asserting that our products or services sold to customers or software-based network functions infringe on their patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly, such as network functions or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, such as wireless handsets, could require us to pay damages, royalties, stop offering the relevant products or services and/or cease network functions or other activities. While the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement claims or the expiration or non-renewal of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 MAJOR CUSTOMERS 
 No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in 2018, 2017 or 2016. 
 COMPETITION 
 Information relating to competition in each of our operating segments is contained in the Annual Report under the heading Competition beginning on page 41, and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 AT&T scientists and engineers conduct research in a variety of areas, including IP networking, advanced network design and architecture, network and cyber security, network operations support systems, satellite technology, video platform development and data analytics. The majority of the development activities are performed to create new services and to invent tools and systems to manage secure and reliable networks for us and our customers. Research and development expenses were $1,194 million in 2018, $1,503 million in 2017, and $1,649 million in 2016. 
EMPLOYEES 
 As of January 31, 2019, we employed approximately 268,000 persons. Approximately 40% of our employees are represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) or other unions. After expiration of the agreements, work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached. A contract now covering approximately 8,300 traditional wireline employees in our Midwest region expired in April 2018 and employees are working under the terms of the prior contract, including benefits, while negotiations continue. In addition, a contract now covering approximately 3,300 traditional wireline employees in our legacy AT&T Corp. business also expired in April 2018. Those employees are working under the terms of their prior contract, including benefits, while negotiations continue. Other contracts covering approximately 26,000 employees are scheduled to expire during 2019. 
 At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 548,000 retirees and dependents that were eligible to receive retiree benefits. 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 A putative stockholder class action lawsuit has been filed in connection with statements made in the registration statement and prospectus on Form S-4 (S-4), filed by AT&T with the SEC in connection with our acquisition of Time Warner Inc. The action, Hoffman v. Stephenson et al. (the Hoffman Complaint), filed on February 7, 2019 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, alleges violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by AT&T and certain of AT&Ts current officers and directors based on alleged misrepresentations and omissions in the S-4 relating to trends in its then Entertainment Group segment and in particular with respect to the number of subscribers to our DIRECTV NOW service. The plaintiff in the Hoffman Complaint seeks damages, attorneys fees and costs, rescission, disgorgement and other and further relief. We believe the claims in the Hoffman Complaint are without merit and will vigorously defend our legal position in court.
