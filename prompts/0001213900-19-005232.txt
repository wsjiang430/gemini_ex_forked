Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Arcimoto’s mission is to catalyze the shift to a sustainable transportation system. Since our incorporation, we have been engaged primarily in the design, development and pre-production of ultra-efficient three-wheeled electric vehicles. Arcimoto was formed on November 21, 2007 as WTP Incorporated, an Oregon Corporation, and later changed its name to Arcimoto, Inc.
 
We went public in September 2017, following the conclusion of a Tier 2 Regulation A stock offering that netted $18.1 million, after offering costs. Our shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol ‘FUV.’
 
Thesis
 
Current automotive platforms are inefficient by design. Cars can weigh upwards of 4,000 lbs., take up on average almost 50 square feet of space on the road and when parked, and are way overcapacity for vast majority of daily transportation tasks– those involving one or two people, traveling a relatively short distance, with a relatively small amount of stuff.
 
Arcimoto develops and manufactures products tuned for the actual utility needs of everyday driving. By doing so, we aim to deliver meaningfully more efficient solutions to the market, at a fraction of the total cost of ownership of today’s cars.
 
Platform and Technologies
 
Arcimoto spent its first decade developing and refining eight generations of a new three-wheeled electric vehicle platform– a light-footprint, nimble reverse-trike architecture that features a low center of gravity for stability on the road, dual-motor front wheel drive for enhanced traction, can park three to a space while carrying two large adults comfortably, and is more efficient, by an order of magnitude, than today's cars.
Products
 
Arcimoto is currently developing three vehicle products based on the Arcimoto Platform: the Fun Utility Vehicle® (FUV®), the Rapid Responder™, and the Deliverator™. While intended to serve very different market segments, an estimated 90% of the constituent parts are the same between our three initial products.
Fun Utility Vehicle
 
Arcimoto’s flagship product is the Fun Utility Vehicle. The FUV delivers a thrilling ride experience, exceptional maneuverability, comfort for two passengers with gear, rockstar parking (three to a space), and ultra-efficient operation, all at an affordable price. Over time, we anticipate offering the FUV with several option packages to meet the needs of a variety of customers. As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,217 pre-orders for production FUVs, representing an increase of 983, or 44%, from the 2,234 pre-orders as of December 31, 2017. As of March 29, 2019, we had 3,883 pre-orders.

Evergreen Edition
 
Arcimoto plans to enter the market with the Evergreen Edition FUV. We are leading with a consumer product, because we are a consumer-first brand. We believe individuals should be able to choose more efficient, more affordable, and lighter footprint mobility solutions, so that more of us can participate in the transition to sustainable transportation future.
 
We began taking non-refundable $5,000 reservation payments from our pre-order customers in Oregon, California, and Washington for our first Retail Series FUV offering, the Evergreen Edition, in February of 2019. The Evergreen Edition is priced at $19,900 with a set options package, targeted to begin production in Q2 2019. As of the end of Q1, we have confirmed reservations for our planned Q2 production capacity of 100 Evergreen Edition FUVs, and have begun taking reservations for Q3 production.
 
Rapid Responder
 
The Rapid Responder was announced on February 15, 2019. The pure-electric Rapid Responder is developed on the Arcimoto platform, and designed for specialized emergency, security and law enforcement services at a fraction of the cost and environmental impact of traditional combustion vehicles. The Rapid Responder aims to deliver first responders to incidents more quickly and affordably than traditional emergency response vehicles.
 
Initially targeting the 50,000 fire stations across the United States that use traditional fire engines and large automobiles to respond to calls, Arcimoto plans to market the Rapid Responder as a solution for campus security and law enforcement applications as well.
 
Arcimoto has agreed in principle to test the Rapid Responder in pilot programs with the City of Eugene, the Eugene-Springfield Fire Department, and the city of Eastvale, California. We anticipate that the first production Rapid Responders will be delivered in 2020.
 
Deliverator
 
Development of the Deliverator (“It Delivers!”) was officially announced on March 19, 2019 with the reveal of the first Deliverator prototype.
 
The Deliverator is a pure electric, last-mile delivery solution designed to more quickly, efficiently, and affordably get goods where they need to go. We plan for the Deliverator to be customizable to carry a wide array of products, from pizza, groceries and cold goods to the 65 billion parcels delivered worldwide annually.
 
We anticipate that the first production Deliverators will be delivered in 2020.
 
Autonomous Arcimoto
 
Our long term goal is to offer the market one of the lowest cost, most efficient “last mile” human and goods transport solutions for the robotically-driven world. Because the platform electronics are capable of taking drive, brake and steer commands “by wire,” we intend that our platform will provide a ready foundation for self-driving technology deployment.
Sales and Distribution Model
 
Arcimoto’s sales and distribution model is direct. Once we are in retail production, our customers will place vehicle orders on our website, and the vehicle product will be delivered directly to the end user via common carrier or our own delivery fleet.
 
We plan to deliver the initial Evergreen FUVs to customers in the three west coast states of Washington, Oregon and California. Once Retail Series production is underway, we plan to progress to nation-wide distribution.

Rental Franchise Model
 
We plan to augment this direct web purchase process with small-footprint experience rental in select key markets. This rental model will give prospective customers a direct experience with the physical product before purchasing. Furthermore, this rental model is easily franchisable, giving individuals and small business owners the opportunity to operate their own rental location. Arcimoto has contracted a franchise consultant firm, and with their help has completed the Franchise Disclosure Document, allowing us to dialogue with interested parties.
 
On October 27, 2018, we opened our first customer experience and rental location in Eugene, Oregon and took possession of a second rental location in the Gaslamp District in San Diego, California. We used the Eugene rental facility primarily as a test bed for developing the rental operations. The Eugene rental facility allowed prospective customers to rent an FUV without the pressures typical of the traditional sales process. We learned a great deal from this short-term test that we believe will help us refine our rental operations in preparation for a planned reopening of the Eugene rental facility and launch of the San Diego rental operation after Retail FUV production has commenced.
 
Service and Warranty
 
We are pursuing three different models for service of the FUV:
 
Service-on-demand. Our initial model is on-demand and on-site vehicle service by Arcimoto technicians or Arcimoto-authorized technicians. Service-on-demand will likely be the primary model during our West Coast release as the majority of the vehicles will be geographically located relatively near the factory. We intend for customers to request service either through the Arcimoto mobile app or by calling a 24hr service number.
 
In-market partnership. We are currently reviewing potential partners located in our key distribution regions.
 
Retail facility service. We plan to employ Arcimoto service technicians at some of our rental locations. Customers near those rental locations would be able to deliver their vehicle to that location for service needs.
 
Warranty. We will begin recording warranty reserves with the commencement of Retail Series production of the FUV in the second quarter of 2019. We plan to provide a warranty, based on the warranty in effect at the time of purchase, which will generally include certain production powertrain components and battery pack sales. We plan to accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle or powertrain component is delivered to the customer. Warranty reserves will include management’s best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace any items under warranty, based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data. We will review our reserves quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and we will adjust our estimates as needed. Warranty expense will be recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the statement of operations. The portion of the warranty provision which is expected to be incurred within 12 months from the balance sheet date will be classified as current, while the remaining amount will be classified as long-term liabilities.
Facility
 
In October 2017, we took possession of our new factory, the AMP, and immediately began retrofitting the space. In December 2017, all employees relocated to the new site and we began operations there. To make the new factory usable for our purposes, we updated the building with brighter energy efficient lighting, polished the production floor to improve cleanliness, painted to increase light levels, remodeled the employee facilities and commenced installation of the manufacturing equipment. The majority of our manufacturing equipment, key for reducing cost of most sheet and tube metal parts on the FUV, was in place by mid-2018. Further, we enclosed approximately 8,000 square feet of loading dock area at the AMP to create a well-organized materials space with four truck loading bays, improving inventory management.

During the 4th quarter of 2018 we remodeled a 5,700 square foot inventory warehouse located across the street into useable office spaces and moved non-manufacturing personnel into these new offices in order to free up production space in the AMP.
 
Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations
 
Many governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling, substances of concern, vehicle damage, recall, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. In addition, manufacturing and other vehicle assembly facilities in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances. In addition, the regulations in this area are constantly evolving, especially with the entry of new vehicles into the market.
 
Some of the significant standards and regulations affecting Arcimoto are discussed below:
 
Motor Vehicle Safety
 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the “NHTSA”) defines a motorcycle as “a motor vehicle with motive power having a seat or saddle for the use of the rider and designed to travel on not more than three wheels in contact with the ground.” In order for a manufacturer to sell motorcycles in the United States, the manufacturer has to self-certify to meet a certain set of regulatory requirements promulgated by the NHTSA in its Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.
 
In 2018, Arcimoto developed an internal regulatory compliance team to ensure that the FUV production vehicles will meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards requirements for motorcycles.
 
Regulatory compliance and safety issues discovered during 2018 were filed in NHTSA recalls.
 
EPA certification
 
Although Arcimoto’s products are built on a zero emission vehicle platform, the EPA requires standard vehicle efficiency metrics be communicated to consumers, regardless of the vehicle’s drive train. Arcimoto plans to complete EPA efficiency testing in Q2, in order to meet the requirements for market entry of Arcimoto’s Evergreen FUV.
 
Electromagnetic Compatibility
 
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is the federal agency responsible for implementing and enforcing the communications law and regulations, including title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, specifically Part 15, which regulates unlicensed radio-frequency transmissions, both intentional and unintentional. With very few exceptions, all electronics devices must be reviewed to comply with Part 15 before they can be advertised or sold in the US market. In 2018, Arcimoto developed an internal regulatory compliance team to ensure that the FUV production vehicles will meet these regulatory requirements. Arcimoto has successfully completed over 90% of all required electromagnetic compatibility testing and plans to complete this testing and demonstrate full compliance in Q2, in order to meet the requirements for market entry of Arcimoto’s Evergreen FUV.
Motor Vehicle Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
 
As with helmet laws and driver license requirements, state laws that regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of motor vehicles are a patchwork, nationwide. Where Arcimoto is allowed by statute to be recognized as a dealer, Arcimoto plans to open its own retail distribution facilities or services. For customers living in states where Arcimoto is prohibited from selling directly from within the state, we plan to consummate sales at facilities in Oregon and deliver the vehicle to the end user via common carrier.
 
5


Arcimoto is registered as a manufacturer in Oregon, and California, and as a dealer in Oregon and has applied for a dealer license in California.
 
Franchise Laws for Rental Operations
 
Arcimoto’s approach to in-market experience relies on prospective customers renting Fun Utility Vehicles. As such, we plan to open Company-owned sites, as well as offer independent franchise rental operations. We have prepared Franchise Disclosure Documentation, have approval in 30 states and have applications pending in 3 states for the ability to sell franchises within those states. We are currently approved for franchise sales in Florida, Rhode Island, Texas and all 27 non-registration states.
State Tax Credits
 
The state of Oregon passed a tax credit qualifying the Arcimoto for both a $2,500 tax credit for purchasing qualified electric vehicles and an additional $2,500 tax credit if the purchaser’s annual income is below a certain threshold. We anticipate that the state of California may offer a tax credit of $900 or more for the purchase of Arcimoto vehicles.
 
We will continue to advocate that state legislatures and regulators include Arcimoto’s affordable, ultra-efficient vehicles in their clean vehicle incentive programs.
 
Federal Tax Credits
 
Arcimoto is part of a coalition of U.S. electric motorcycle manufacturers who are encouraging the Federal government to extend the expired 10% electric motorcycle tax credit, and expand that credit to include three-wheeled electric motorcycles as well.
Operator’s License and Helmet Requirements
 
State regulations regarding operator licensing and occupant helmet requirements are currently a nationwide patchwork with regard to three-wheeled vehicles. While the strong majority of states have some form of exemption from helmet and motorcycle license requirements for three-wheeled vehicles, the specific wording of each state’s statute may or may not include Arcimoto platform vehicles. For example, in our initial market states of California and Oregon, three wheeled vehicles that are “fully enclosed” or “enclosed cab” are exempt from helmet and motorcycle endorsement requirements. Washington’s helmet law, by contrast, requires compliance with rollover safety regulations and the presence of a steering wheel to exempt riders.
 
Arcimoto’s advocacy strategy is to work with state legislatures to advocate the normalization of these rules to reduce consumer confusion in the marketplace that comes from conflicting state-by-state regulations.
 
Pollution Control Costs
 
We are required to comply with stationary source air pollution, water pollution, and hazardous waste control standards that are now in effect or are scheduled to come into effect with respect to our manufacturing operations.

Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
Our policy is to protect our competitive position by, among other methods, filing patent applications to protect technology and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We have generated several patents and expect this portfolio to continue to grow as we actively pursue additional technological innovation. As of December 31, 2018, we have five issued utility patents, including three patents covering novel aspects of the vehicle architecture expiring in 2031 and 2035, one patent covering a vehicle battery system expiring in 2035, and one patent covering Arcimoto’s novel dual-motor gearbox design expiring in 2035. The USPTO sent us a Notice of Allowance for a fourth utility patent covering the advances made to the platform through the current model FUV and expiring in 2035. We filed an additional non-provisional utility patent application covering advances in the dual-motor gearbox. We expect that the U.S. Patent Office will issue at least two additional patents in the first half of 2019 relating to improvements in battery systems and vehicle powertrains. At present, Arcimoto has three additional patent applications undergoing examination that relate to a diverse range of vehicle systems, including electrical, powertrain, and the overall vehicle platform.
 
In addition to this intellectual property, we also rely on our proprietary knowledge and ongoing technological innovation to develop a competitive position in the market for our products. Each of these patents, patent applications, and know-how are integral to the conduct of our business, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
