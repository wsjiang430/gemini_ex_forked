Item 1. Business
 
Viveve designs, develops, manufactures and markets a platform medical technology, which we refer to as Cryogen-cooled Monopolar RadioFrequency, or CMRF. Our proprietary CMRF technology is delivered through a radiofrequency generator, handpiece and treatment tip, that collectively, we refer to as the Viveve® System. The Viveve System is currently being marketed around the world (outside of the United States) for the non-invasive treatment of vaginal introital laxity, sexual function, vaginal rejuvenation, and stress urinary incontinence depending on the relevant country-specific clearance or approval, that we refer to as the Viveve treatment.
 
At this time, the Viveve System is indicated for use and being marketed for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis in the United States; the device has not been cleared or approved for use for the treatment of vaginal laxity, to improve sexual function, for vaginal rejuvenation, or for stress urinary incontinence in the United States. Accordingly, the Company is prohibited under current U.S. regulations from promoting it to physicians or consumers for these unapproved uses.

We believe the Viveve System and Viveve treatment, provides a number of benefits for physicians and patients, including:
 

● | a safe, minimally-invasive, non-ablative procedure;
--+----------------------------------------------------
● | requiring only a single treatment; 
● | compelling physician economics; and 
● | ease of use. 

 
In North America, which includes the U.S. and Canada, the Viveve System is sold through a direct sales force, as well as distribution partners. In most other regions, we market and sell primarily through a network of distribution partners.
 
Currently, the Viveve System is cleared for marketing in 60 countries throughout the world under the following indications for use:
 

Indication for Use: | No. of Countries:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------
General surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis (including the U.S.) | 3 
General surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis of vaginal tissue and for the treatment of vaginal laxity | 32 
For treatment of vaginal laxity | 6 
For treatment of the vaginal introitus, after vaginal childbirth, to improve sexual function | 16 
General surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis and for the treatment of vaginal laxity | 1 
For vaginal rejuvenation | 1 
For treatment of vaginal laxity, urinary incontinence and sexual function | 1 

 
The Viveve System is comprised of three main components: a radiofrequency generator housed in a table-top console; a reusable handpiece; and a single-use treatment tip. Single-use accessories (e.g. RF return pad, coupling fluid), a cryogen canister that can be used for approximately two to five procedures (depending on the procedure type and pulses used), and a foot pedal are also included with the System. Practitioners attach the single-use treatment tip to the handpiece. The generator then authenticates the treatment tip and programs the system for the desired treatment without further intervention. The treatment is performed in a physician’s office and does not require the use of anesthesia. The tissue remodeling effect resulting from the Viveve treatment has been demonstrated by our pre-clinical and clinical research.
 
Our goal is to become the leading provider of non-invasive solutions to treat certain women’s intimate health conditions by:
 

● | Broadening the conditions, we treat through robust clinical trials and regulatory label expansion. In addition to pursuing clearance/approval in the U.S. for the improvement of sexual function, we intend to conduct several clinical trials, and if successful, submit for regulatory clearance/approval in the U.S. and abroad for stress urinary incontinence and potentially vulvovaginal atrophy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increasing the Number of Installed Base of Viveve Systems. In our existing markets, we plan to (i) expand the number of Viveve Systems by leveraging our current and future clinical study results and through innovative marketing programs directed at both physicians and patients, where permissible by law, and (ii) expand our efforts and obtain regulatory approvals in additional markets, although there are no assurances that we will ever receive such approvals.
● | Driving Increased Treatment Tip Usage. We work collaboratively with our physician customer base to increase treatment tip usage by enhancing customer awareness and facilitating the marketing efforts of our physician customers to their patients, where permitted by law. We intend to launch innovative marketing programs with physician customers, where permitted by law, to develop high volume Viveve practices. 
● | Broadening Our Customer Base. While our initial focus is on marketing our procedure to the aesthetics and OB/GYN specialty, we intend to selectively expand our sales efforts into other physician specialties, such as urology, urogynecology, general surgery and family practice. Additionally, we intend to pursue sales from physician-directed medi-spas with track records of safe and successful treatments. 


● | Developing New Treatment Tips and System Enhancements. We intend to continue to expand our line of treatment tips that, in the future, may allow for shorter procedure times to benefit both physicians and patients. We also plan to pursue potential system modifications and next generation enhancements that will further increase the ease-of-use of the Viveve System.

Our Products
 
The Viveve System
 
The Viveve System is comprised of three main components: a radiofrequency generator housed in a table-top console; a reusable handpiece; and a single-use treatment tip. Single-use accessories (e.g. RF return pad, coupling fluid), cryogen canister for approximately two to five procedures (depending on the procedure type and pulses used), and a foot pedal are also included with the System. Physicians or medical practitioners attach the single-use treatment tip to the handpiece, which is connected to the console. The generator authenticates the treatment tip and programs the system for the desired Viveve treatment without further intervention.

● | Radiofrequency Generator. The generator produces a six-megahertz signal and is simple and efficient to operate. Controls are within easy reach, and important user information is clearly displayed on the console’s built-in display, including energy delivered, tissue impedance, duration and feedback on procedure technique. Cooling is achieved, in conjunction with the generator, through the delivery of a coolant that helps to cool and protect the mucosa during a procedure. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Handpiece. The reusable handpiece holds the treatment tip in place and processes information about temperature, contact, cooling system function and other important data. A precision control valve within the handpiece meters the delivery of coolant, which protects the mucosal surface tissue. 
● | Treatment Tip. The single-use treatment tip is available in two sizes and comes pre-sterilized. Each treatment tip contains a proprietary internal EEPROM or Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory chip, which stores treatment parameters and safety limits in order to optimize performance and safety. To enhance procedural safety, we have programmed the EEPROM for single-use treatments. Using the same treatment tip to perform multiple procedures could result in injury, therefore, the EEPROM disables the treatment tip after a pre-programmed number of pulses to ensure that the treatment tip is not reused.

 
The Viveve System also includes other consumable components. The console houses a canister of coolant that can be used for approximately two to five procedures (depending on the procedure type and pulses used). Each procedure requires a new return pad, which is typically adhered to the patient’s thigh or buttocks to allow a path of travel for the RF current through the body and back to the generator. We also sell proprietary single-use bottles of coupling fluid, a viscous liquid that helps ensure electrical and thermal contact with the treatment tip.
 
Technology Platform - Cryogen-cooled Monopolar Radiofrequency (CMRF)
 
The Viveve System uses a patented and proprietary method of delivering monopolar radiofrequency (RF) energy for treating tissue:
 

● | Monopolar Radiofrequency Energy. Monopolar RF delivery uses an active electrode applied to the target tissue and a passive return electrode adhered to the patient’s thigh or buttocks. RF current is concentrated where the active electrode touches the body and expands as it is drawn through progressively deeper layers of tissue toward the return electrode. Providing both precise placement and deep energy penetration, the monopolar arrangement draws higher levels of therapeutic energy into deeper tissue layers than competing bipolar arrangements that rely on passive dispersion of current passing between two closely spaced electrodes on the tissue surface.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Capacitive Coupling Mechanism of Action for Collagen Heating. Our single-use Viveve treatment tip contains patented technology that uses monopolar RF energy as a controlled tissue heating source through the use of a non-conducting material, known as a dielectric. Capacitive coupling is the use of the dielectric to create an electric field in the area where the treatment tip touches the body. The electric field induces a current within the surrounding tissue, resulting in volumetric heating of the tissue due to the tissue’s natural resistance to electrical current flow. Collagen is an efficient conductor of electricity and therefore acts as a pathway for the electric current. This process results in heating of the fibrous septae, the strands of collagen fibers that permeate tissues and connect the outer mucosal layer to the underlying muscle. Delivery of heat to the fibrous septae located in deeper layers of the tissue shrinks and shortens them, resulting in tightening of the mucosal tissue. Over one to three months, as part of the body’s natural response to the activation of fibroblasts that results from the application of low-energy hyperthermic RF energy, aging collagen is reorganized into stronger, tighter bundles and can be supplemented with new collagen. This renewal of the tissue support matrix leads to improved tissue integrity and function.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Viveve System also uses a proprietary, controlled cryogen surface cooling that enables deep volumetric heating of vaginal tissue:
 

● | Reverse Thermal Gradient. With radiofrequency delivery, it is typical to expect higher temperatures closest to the surface electrode and a comparatively lower temperature distal to the electrode. However, with the Viveve System the opposite is true, hence a “reverse” thermal gradient. Maintaining a well-cooled, protected surface allows our treatment tips to safely remain on the tissue longer, allowing an optimal amount of RF energy penetration into the deeper tissue layers, while helping to ensure a comfortable patient experience.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Algorithmically-controlled Cryogen Delivery. The Viveve System software actively monitors the temperature of the surface tissue and delivers the appropriate amount of cryogen necessary to keep the surface near normal body temperature. It does so consistently, automatically and completely independently of the actions of the operator, providing an important built-in safety mechanism to protect the delicate surface of vaginal tissue. 

Market Overview
 
Overview of Vaginal Laxity and Sexual Function
 
Vaginal laxity and tissue architecture have often been overlooked as contributing etiological factors to female sexual dysfunction. Vaginal laxity can lead to diminished physical sensation during intercourse. This reduction in sensation is often coupled with a reduction in sexual satisfaction, all of which can also impact a woman’s sense of sexual self-esteem and her relationship with her sexual partner.
 
Vaginal laxity is infrequently discussed in a clinical situation, yet most surveyed OB/GYNs and urogynecologists recognize that it is an underreported, yet bothersome, medical condition that impacts relationship happiness and sexual function. Another survey of OB/GYNs, found that vaginal laxity is the most frequent physical change seen or discussed post-vaginal delivery. Additionally, in a survey of women ranging from 25-45 years of age, who had experienced at least one vaginal delivery, approximately half expressed some degree of concern over “looseness” of the vaginal introitus.
 
Women can develop vaginal laxity for a number of reasons, including aging, genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and/or trauma. As women age, slower cellular renewal coupled with reduced vascular and glandular networks contributes to loss of underlying supportive fibrous tissue. Some women may have underlying pathophysiological issues with collagen formation, remodeling and repair; and their lifestyle choices (e.g., alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and excessive food consumption) also play a role in the integrity of vaginal tissue. Vaginal trauma (e.g., childbirth, surgery, self-stimulation, or coitus) can also contribute to vaginal laxity.
 
All women who have given birth vaginally undergo stretching of the tissues of the vaginal opening to accommodate the fetal head. Often the effects are permanent, and many women have long-term physical and psychological consequences including sexual dissatisfaction. One significant issue is the loosening of the introitus ─ the vaginal opening. This may happen with the first vaginal delivery and can be made worse with subsequent vaginal deliveries. Vaginal laxity can result in decreased sexual pleasure for both women and their partners during intercourse. We believe that this condition is not frequently discussed because women are embarrassed, fear that their concerns will be dismissed or fear that their physicians will not understand. Physicians hesitate to discuss the situation with their patients because historically there has been no safe and effective treatment options. Physicians frequently recommend Kegel exercises. However, these exercises only strengthen the pelvic floor muscles and do not address the underlying cause of vaginal laxity – loss of tissue elasticity. While surgery can be performed to tighten the vaginal canal, the formation of scar tissue from the surgery may lead to painful intercourse and permanent side effects.

As a consequence of the physical tissue damage that can result from childbirth, a significant decrease in sexual satisfaction has been reported in women who underwent vaginal delivery, when assessed two years after delivery, in comparison with those who underwent elective caesarian section. In the past several years there has been a marked increase in the number of women requesting delivery by caesarian section with the intention of preventing damage to the pelvic floor and introitus. Caesarian sections are not without risk to both the baby and mother. Whether or not to agree to a woman’s request for an elective caesarian section has generated considerable controversy among obstetricians. If a procedure were available to address the concerns of women about vaginal laxity, we believe the perceived need to have a caesarian section to prevent vaginal tissue damage may decrease significantly. 
 
Market for a Proven Solution for Vaginal Laxity & Sexual Function
 
In 2009, we sponsored several on-line marketing surveys in the U.S. with both OB/GYNs and women, ages 25-55, to assess attitudes of physicians and women about vaginal laxity and towards a safe, non-invasive solution to treat this condition.

● | Physician Survey: An OB/GYN marketing survey was conducted by OB/GYN Alliance with nearly 525 practicing OB/GYNs from across the U.S. The objectives of the study were to: obtain insights from physicians on physical changes resulting from childbirth and the corresponding sexual health implications for patients; understand the perceptions and opinions of OB/GYN physicians on a procedure that could be offered to address vaginal laxity following childbirth; and gain an understanding of whom the early adopters may be of the Viveve treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Consumer Survey: In a consumer marketing survey conducted by Q&A Research, 421 women were screened for vaginal delivery, age (25-55), income, education and other factors. The objectives of the survey were to assess the need for the Viveve treatment and better understand the complexity of emotions and the psychological profile of women who experience, but do not discuss, vaginal changes post childbirth. 

 
Results from these surveys suggested that vaginal laxity is a significant unmet medical need, and that patients and physicians would benefit significantly from a safe and effective non-invasive treatment that would also increase physical sensation and sexual satisfaction following vaginal childbirth. Of the 421 patient respondents, up to 48% felt that vaginal laxity was a concern post-childbirth. Furthermore, it is evident that patients and their OB/GYNs are not discussing vaginal laxity on a regular basis; in fact, we believe such conversations occur quite infrequently due to many factors, including patient embarrassment and fear of being ridiculed, lack of time and lack of solutions for physicians. Of the nearly 525 OB/GYNs surveyed, 84% indicated that vaginal laxity is the number one post-delivery physical change for women, being more prevalent than weight gain, urinary incontinence and stretch marks, and believe that it is under-reported by their patients. Additionally, in a separate international survey of urogynecologists, 83% of the 563 respondents described vaginal laxity as underreported by their patients and the majority considered it a bothersome condition that impacts sexual function and relationships. Despite the lack of communication regarding this issue, we believe there is a strong interest among patients and doctors for a treatment that is clinically proven and safe.
 
Applying U.S. census data, CDC Vital Statistics data and our projections from these studies, we estimate there are approximately 9 million post-partum women who are potential candidates for this procedure in the U.S. alone, approximately 4.5 million of whom could be candidates for the Viveve treatment for vaginal laxity or sexual function.
 
In 2012, we conducted a similar consumer study in Japan and Canada in order to understand cultural differences that may exist towards vaginal laxity and the Viveve treatment. The results corroborated our U.S. survey conclusions. Applying World Health Organization census data as well as data from individual countries, we estimate there are 25-30 million women outside the U.S. that could be candidates for the Viveve treatment for vaginal laxity or sexual function.
 
In January 2018, we sponsored a survey of 1,500 women in Great Britain having had a vaginal delivery, and nearly half (48%) worried before having a child about physical changes in their body from childbirth affecting their sex life; this increased to 67% of women in the age range of 25-34. Approximately 4 in 10 (38% overall, 44% ages 25-34) have experienced vaginal tissue changes impacting their physical sensation during sex, with the most common impacts consisting of feeling less confident overall, feeling embarrassed and self-conscious, and feeling less enjoyment or intimacy with their partner.

Current Approved Treatments for Vaginal Laxity/Sexual Function and Their Limitations
 
Currently, few clinically proven medical treatments are available to effectively treat vaginal laxity or sexual function. The most widely prescribed treatments include Kegel exercises and invasive surgical procedures, known as laser vaginal rejuvenation (“LVR”) or vaginoplasty.

● | Kegel Exercises: Kegels are an exercise that was developed by Dr. Arnold Kegel designed to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor - the pubococcygeal (“PC”) muscles - to increase vaginal muscle tone, improve sexual response, and limit involuntary urine release due to stress urinary incontinence. These exercises are often prescribed following childbirth or during and after menopause. However, we are not aware of any validated evidence indicating that Kegels improve vaginal laxity or sexual function due to introital laxity. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Surgical Procedures: Of the various alternatives for treating vaginal laxity, invasive surgical procedures, such as LVR, are the only modalities with any proven efficacy outcomes. Typically, they are performed by plastic surgeons with patients under general anesthesia. According to The International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (“ISAPS”), approximately 114,135 LVR surgeries were performed world-wide in 2013. However, these invasive surgical procedures are expensive, costing thousands of dollars, and can involve weeks of post-surgical recovery time for the patient. They also carry the risk of scarring, which can lead to uncomfortable or painful intercourse, long-term or permanent loss of sensation, serious infection, tissue necrosis, hematomas (fluid collection under the tissue that may require removal), and adverse reactions to anesthesia.

Overview of Stress Urinary Incontinence
 
Urinary incontinence (UI) is deﬁned by the International Continence Society (ICS) as ‘‘the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine.’’ UI is increasingly recognized globally as a health and economic problem, which affects the physical, psychological, social and economic well-being of individuals and their families and poses a substantial economic burden on health and social services.
 
Women with urinary incontinence have a significantly poorer quality of life than their continent counterparts. The psychological impact of this condition must neither be underestimated nor ignored. The need to use an external pad to absorb urine leakage associated with even normal activities such as coughing or laughing is unsatisfactory, inconvenient, often embarrassing and negatively impacts a woman’s quality of life. The main impact urinary incontinence has on women’s lives, in terms of social and recreational withdrawal, stems from the fear and anxiety related to becoming incontinent in public and the possibility that others may find out. The result is often reduced activities, decreased productivity, isolation, and depression. Additionally, between 25% to 50% of women with urinary incontinence experience sexual dysfunction.
 
There are three types of UI. Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine due to increased abdominal pressure caused by exertion, sneezing or coughing. Urge Urinary Incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by or immediately preceded by urgency. Mixed Urinary Incontinence (MUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine associated with urgency and also with exertion, sneezing, or coughing.
 
According to the most recent National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Health Survey in the U.S., the prevalence of UI in adult women is 33% which is the highest among the ten conditions tracked including obesity, joint pain and hypertension. Additionally, a review of the epidemiologic literature on incontinence showed a prevalence range of 16% to 51% depending on UI definitions, severity levels, and other factors included in the surveys. The average across the literature is 33%, which is similar to the NCHS survey. This translates to 35 million women in the U.S. Of those 35 million 86% have SUI or MUI, 80% of them are bothered and only approximately 700,000 are receiving treatment in the form of conservative therapy or surgical procedures. Accordingly, over 23 million women in the US are bothered by SUI or MUI symptoms and are untreated. Viveve believes that its non-invasive treatment option for SUI may fulfill this large unmet need.
 
SUI has two major subtypes: intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) and urethral hypermobility. Patients with ISD leak urine because their urethral sphincters do not effectively seal off the inner muscle of the bladder. Urethral hypermobility (UH) refers to the urethral shift that occurs when there is an increase in intrabdominal pressure (e.g., cough/sneeze/jump) and insufficient urethral support by the surrounding pelvic floor muscles and tissue. Most women with SUI have a degree of both ISD and UH.
 
Risk factors for SUI include pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause. For example, more than 55% of women who have delivered a child vaginally will show symptoms of SUI and are twice as likely to suffer from long-term SUI when compared to cesarean delivery.
 
Current Cleared Treatments for Stress Urinary Incontinence and Their Limitations
 
Currently available and effective treatment options for SUI are limited to conservative physiotherapy and more aggressive, invasive options with a lack of efficacious options in between. Pelvic floor muscle training (Kegels), with or without use of a device to assist in Kegels, are generally prescribed as a first step in treatment. Some women may find benefit from these exercises, but long-term compliance and sustainability is challenging. At the other end of the treatment spectrum are bulking agents and surgery with native tissue or mesh or a sling. Bulking agents are best used for women with primarily ISD and can be done in a clinic, however they have limited efficacy and durability. Surgeries including synthetic sling placement have a proven success rate, however, mesh surgery often leads to complications. In addition, surgery requires recovery time for the patient and often comes with risks including recurrence, infection, pain, voiding dysfunction, and anesthetic concerns, leading many women to agree to surgery as a last resort for treatment. The large gap between conservative and highly-invasive treatment options presents an opportunity to provide more effective, safe, and less-invasive treatments for women suffering from SUI.

The Viveve Solution
 
Radiofrequency (RF) energy has a long history of use in epithelial/mucosal tissue in the pharynx, skin, cornea, and vagina. Additionally, RF devices have been used to treat a variety of health-related concerns, including SUI. We believe that the Viveve System provides a compelling, safe, non-invasive treatment for vaginal laxity, improvement of sexual function that is supported by clinical studies, and improvement of the symptoms of SUI. The Viveve treatment is conducted on an outpatient basis in a practitioner’s office. The procedure typically takes approximately 30 - 45 minutes depending on the indication being treated and does not require any form of anesthesia. To perform the procedure, a practitioner attaches the single-use treatment tip to the handpiece. As described above, the return pad is then adhered to the patient’s upper leg to allow a path of travel for the RF current back to the generator. Prior to treatment, the treatment area is bathed in coupling fluid, which is used for conduction and lubrication.
 
Benefits of the Viveve Treatment
 
The Viveve treatment provides a number of benefits for physicians and patients:
 

● | Minimally-Invasive, Non-Ablative Treatment with a Demonstrated History of Safety. The Viveve System has been tested in pre-clinical tissue studies and has been used to treat over 500 clinical study patients. To date physicians have treated approximately 15,000 patients. The procedure is non-invasive and offers a treatment option with little or no downtime from the patient’s normal routine. It is also not a surgical procedure and does not damage either the mucosal, sub-mucosal tissue, or any extra vaginal tissues or require any form of anesthesia.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Single Treatment. The Viveve treatment is normally performed in a medical office setting as a single treatment that takes approximately 30 – 45 minutes to complete depending on the indication being treated. Our studies have shown that the clinical effect from our procedure occurs within one to three months and patients continue to report improvement over a period of six months following treatment. In addition, the Viveve treatment maintains its effect for at least 12 months, based upon currently available data from our clinical studies. 
● | Compelling Physician Economics. We believe that in an era of declining government and insurance reimbursement, many physicians are seeking to add effective and safe, self-pay procedures to their practices. The Viveve treatment can be easily adapted into many physician practices and offers compelling per-procedure economics for the physician. 
● | Ease of Use. The Viveve System offers an easy-to-use, straightforward user interface that allows a trained physician or nurse (where permitted by law) to perform the treatment in approximately 30 – 45 minutes depending on the indication being treated. It provides real-time feedback, and the patient can be monitored during the treatment. The handpiece and single-use treatment tip are designed with a small profile for accurate placement during treatment, comfort and ease of use. 

Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to become the leading provider of non-invasive solutions to treat certain women’s intimate health conditions by:
 

● | Broadening the conditions, we treat through robust clinical trials and regulatory label expansion. In addition to pursuing clearance/approval in the U.S. for the improvement of sexual function, we intend to conduct several clinical trials, and if successful, submit for regulatory clearance/approval in the U.S. and abroad for stress urinary incontinence and potentially vulvovaginal atrophy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increasing the Number of Installed Base of Viveve Systems. In our existing markets, we plan to (i) expand the number of Viveve Systems by leveraging our current and future clinical study results and through innovative marketing programs directed at both physicians and patients, where permissible by law, and (ii) expand our efforts and obtain regulatory approvals in additional markets, although there are no assurances that we will ever receive such approvals.
● | Driving Increased Treatment Tip Usage. We work collaboratively with our physician customer base to increase treatment tip usage by enhancing customer awareness and facilitating the marketing efforts of our physician customers to their patients, where permitted by law. We intend to launch innovative marketing programs with physician customers, where permitted by law, to develop a high volume Viveve practice.

● | Broadening Our Customer Base. While our initial focus is on marketing our procedure to the aesthetics and OB/GYN specialty, we intend to selectively expand our sales efforts into other physician specialties, such as urology, urogynecology, general surgery and family practice. Additionally, we intend to pursue sales from physician-directed medi-spas with track records of safe and successful treatments. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We intend to continue to expand our line of treatment tips that, in the future, may allow for shorter procedure times to benefit both physicians and patients. We also plan to pursue potential system modifications and next generation enhancements that will further increase the ease-of-use of the Viveve System. 
● | Investing in Intellectual Property and Patent Protection. We will continue to defend and invest in expanding our intellectual property portfolio, and we intend to file for additional patents to strengthen our intellectual property rights. Areas in which we may pursue additional patent protection include, but are not limited to, redesign of certain system components, disposable components and software algorithms. We believe that our intellectual property rights protect our position as the exclusive provider of a vaginal laxity treatment using monopolar RF technology in the U.S. and in many other countries. (See discussion under the heading “Patents and Proprietary Technology”.)

Our Customers
 
To date, we have focused our commercial efforts in markets where we have received regulatory clearances/approvals. Within each market, we target thought leaders across multiple specialties in order to increase awareness of the conditions we treat and accelerate patient acceptance of Viveve’s treatments. Currently we target a broad number of physician specialties, including; plastic surgeons, aesthetic dermatologists, OBGYNs, urogynecologists, urologists and others.
 
Through our direct sales employees, and distributors, we currently target physicians who have a demonstrated commitment to building a high-volume, non-invasive, treatment business within their practice. As sales of our product continue to expand globally, we intend to continue to utilize distribution partners in most countries.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
International
 
We currently market the Viveve treatments and sell the Viveve System, including the single-use treatment tips in over 50 countries outside of the United States. At the present time, trained direct sales employees or distribution partners represent Viveve and its products in 59 countries in markets in Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.
 
By using a consultative sales process, we form strong relationships with our customers through frequent interactions. Beyond performing initial system installation and on-site training, which can occur within two weeks of a physician’s purchase decision, our sales consultants provide ongoing consultation to physicians on how to integrate the Viveve treatments into their practices and market procedures to their patients, to the extent permitted by law.
 
We, or our distribution partner, also provide comprehensive training and education to each physician upon delivery of the Viveve System. We are not required to provide training but do so to support our physician customers in safely and effectively performing the Viveve treatments.
 
Further, we intend to actively engage in promotional opportunities through participation in industry tradeshows and clinical workshops, as permitted by law, as well as through trade journals, brochures, and our website. We intend to also actively engage in direct-to-consumer marketing of the Viveve treatments where permitted by law, including extensive use of social media, in many cases on a cooperative basis with our distribution partners.

In October 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to sell the Viveve System for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis, and in January 2017 we hired our inaugural direct sales team. Currently, we have 14 direct sales reps covering the United States and two distribution partners. We are actively seeking regulatory clearance from the FDA to allow us to begin to market the Viveve System for the treatment of vaginal tissue to improve sexual function and the symptoms of stress urinary incontinence, to physicians practicing in the U.S. and to build awareness of the Viveve treatment among patients residing in the U.S. If we are successful in obtaining these clearances, we may expand our direct sales efforts in the future.

Clinical Studies

We have completed several pre-clinical and human clinical studies in vaginal tissue to assess the safety and efficacy of the Viveve treatment in vaginal laxity/sexual function and SUI. We are currently conducting a sexual function trial under IDE in the U.S. (VIVEVE II), an international trial in Canada for SUI (LIBERATE-International) and are preparing to conduct a clinical study in the U.S. for SUI (LIBERATE-US), when we receive approval of our IDE application from the FDA. While we believe that our pre-clinical and human clinical studies have, and will, show that the Viveve System and the Viveve treatment have a strong safety profile and are effective, there is risk that the FDA will not agree with this assessment. Notwithstanding the safety in trials to date of the Viveve System, patients may experience undesirable side effects such as temporary swelling or reddening of the treated tissue.
Pre-clinical Studies
 
In 2010, in collaboration with West Virginia University, we conducted an animal study in sheep to assess the safety, and further understand the mechanism of action, of the Viveve treatment. The vaginal introitus of five parous sheep were treated once with the Viveve System using a variety of energy levels (75−90 Joules/cm2). Each sheep then underwent serial vaginal biopsies immediately after treatment, at approximately one week, and at one, three and six months (4-5 samples per occurrence). Control biopsies were also obtained from three untreated parous sheep. We examined the vaginal mucosa and underlying connective tissue for thermal changes and subsequent tissue responses over a six-month period through light microscopic examination of haematoxylin and eosin (“H&E”) stained slides that were reviewed by pathologists who were blinded as to the treated and untreated sheep.
 
The results of the study indicated that the optimal level of RF energy delivered was 90 J/cm2 and the biopsies supported the hypothesis that the mechanism of action of our technology involves connective tissue remodeling with fibroblast activation and new collagen production. Given the post-treatment absence of ulcerations, regional necrosis or diffuse fibrosis, throughout the six-month follow-up period, we believe the studies help support the safety profile of the Viveve System.
 
As part of our clinical studies, we have studied and continue to study, the interaction of RF energy and tissue to further understand the mechanism of action of the Viveve procedure. We have used transmission electron microscopy on ovine biopsied tissue samples to corroborate that our product induces subtle collagen modification and the deposition of new collagen that leads to tissue tightening and restoration of tissue elasticity. We have developed histology techniques to investigate the depth of heat in tissue, fibroblast activation and collagen deposition that we believe is responsible for long-term improvement and tightening of tissue. We have also created three-dimensional computer models to study tissue heating with our product. Determining the effectiveness of this type of treatment is inherently a subjective evaluation, and the FDA could disagree. When performing our clinical studies, we attempt to utilize the most compelling measures we can in order to provide convincing evidence of efficacy.
 
Clinical Studies – Vaginal Laxity and Sexual Function
 
United States Pilot Study
 
We conducted our first human study beginning in November 2008. The study was a single-arm study (without a control group) conducted in 24 female subjects, ages 25-44 years old, each of whom had experienced at least one full-term vaginal delivery. The study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the Viveve System for the treatment of vaginal laxity at three RF dosing levels. Each woman underwent a single Viveve treatment, with no anesthesia – three patients received 60 joules/cm2, three patients received 75 joules/cm2, and 18 patients received 90 joules/cm2. Patient outcomes were measured at baseline, one month, three months, six months, and 12 months using several validated patient-reported outcome measures, including a company-designed vaginal laxity/tightness questionnaire (“VSQ”), Female Sexual Function Index (“FSFI”), Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (“FSDS-R”) and the Global Response Assessment.
 
Within one month after the Viveve treatment, patients reported a statistically significant improvement in vaginal laxity scores, sexual function and sexual satisfaction scores to pre-childbirth levels. These results continued throughout the 12-month follow-up period. Additionally, patients reported a statistically significant decrease at one month, and thereafter, in their personal distress scores from sexual activity. 
 
The Viveve treatment also demonstrated a strong safety profile throughout the study. The treatment was well tolerated and there were no procedure-related adverse events or serious adverse events through the 12-month follow-up period.  
 
Japan Pilot Study
 
Our second human clinical study began in March 2010. This study was an open-label study conducted in 30 female subjects, ages 21-55 years old, each of whom had experienced at least one full-term vaginal delivery. The study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the Viveve System for the treatment of vaginal laxity. Each woman was treated once with the Viveve System, with no anesthesia, using 90 joules/cm2 of RF energy as the therapeutic dose.
 
Patient reported outcomes were measured at baseline, one month, three months, six months, and 12 months using several validated patient-reported outcome measures, including VSQ, FSFI, FSDS-R and the Global Response Assessment.
 
Within one month after the Viveve procedure, patients reported a statistically significant improvement in vaginal laxity scores, sexual function and sexual satisfaction scores to pre-childbirth levels. These results continued throughout the 12-month follow-up period. Additionally, patients reported a statistically significant decrease at one month, and thereafter, in their personal distress scores from sexual activity.

The Viveve procedure continued to demonstrate a strong safety profile. The treatment was well tolerated and there were no procedure-related adverse events or serious adverse events through the 12-month follow-up period.
 
VIVEVE I Clinical Study
 
In the fourth quarter of 2014, we began the VIVEVE I clinical study (VIveve treatment of the Vaginal introitus to EValuate Effectiveness), sometimes referred to in this report as the “OUS Clinical Trial,” a randomized, blinded and sham-controlled trial designed to further demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the Viveve System versus a sham procedure for the treatment of vaginal laxity. Nine clinical sites in four countries (Canada, Italy, Spain and Japan) enrolled 174 patients, which included pre-menopausal females 18 years of age or older who experienced at least one full term vaginal delivery at least 12 months prior to enrollment date, randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either an active treatment group or sham-control group. Patients were followed for six months post-treatment to assess the primary effectiveness and safety endpoints of the study with data being collected at one, three and six-months. The study also included a prospective interim data analysis at the three-month endpoint of 50% of the patients enrolled. Patients randomized to the sham arm were offered the opportunity to receive a Viveve treatment once they had completed the six-month evaluation following the sham intervention.
 
The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of subjects in the active arm as compared to the proportion of subjects in the sham arm reporting no vaginal laxity at six months post-intervention. “No vaginal laxity” was operationally defined as a score > 4 on the VSQ, a patient reported global assessment of vaginal laxity based on a 7-point scale. Additionally, the primary safety endpoint was the proportion of subjects in the active arm experiencing an adverse event (“AE”) by six months post-treatment as compared to the proportion of the subjects in the sham arm experiencing an AE by six months post-intervention. Secondary endpoints included the adjusted change in mean score on the FSFI, FSDS-R and the Vaginal Laxity Inventory (“VALI”). The VALI was created specifically for the assessment of vaginal laxity by external medical experts. 
 
In April 2016, we completed the VIVEVE I study and reported the following results:
 
At six months (n=155), the proportion of patients reporting “no vaginal laxity” in the active arm, as measured by the VSQ, was 41.7%, while the proportion of patients reporting “no vaginal laxity” in the sham arm on the VSQ was 19.2% (p=0.005). Moreover, the likelihood of having “no vaginal laxity” following treatment in the active arm was more than three times greater than for the sham arm (p=0.006). Further, nearly 80% of the subjects in the active arm experienced a positive change in VSQ score versus baseline.
 
At six months, for those patients who scored less than a 26.5 total score on the FSFI at baseline (n=103), the adjusted mean change from baseline score between the active arm and the sham arm was 3.2 (p=0.009). Moreover, for each of the six individual domains of the FSFI, subjects in the active group reported a greater increase in score than in the sham group. Change in scores from baseline for both the sexual arousal and orgasm domains were statistically significant and nearly 93% of subjects in the active arm experienced an increase in score versus baseline.
 
At six months, FSDS-R and VALI were also assessed as part of the secondary end-point analysis. While subjects in the active arm reported a greater increase in scores than the sham arm, the results for the FSDS-R and VALI were not statistically significant.
 
Safety for the study was assessed on the entire study population (n=174). Subjects reported the same level of unrelated (32.5% active versus 35.1% sham), related (11.1% active versus 12.3% sham) and serious (0.0% active versus 1.8% sham) adverse events in both the active and sham arm, further demonstrating that the Viveve treatment is well tolerated with no safety concerns.
 
We believe that the consistency of results across these three clinical study populations, is indicative of the cross-cultural similarities in this medical condition and the positive impact that an effective non-invasive treatment can have on the sexual health of women after vaginal childbirth.
 
VIVEVE II Clinical Study
 
In March 2019, enrollment was completed for the VIVEVE II (VIveve treatment of the Vaginal Introitus to EValuate Effectiveness) clinical study following IDE approval by the FDA. This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Viveve System to improve symptoms of female sexual disfunction, associated with vaginal laxity. 19 active clinical sites in the United States enrolled 250 female patients who were pre-menopausal, 18 years of age or older who experienced at least one full term vaginal delivery at least twelve months prior to enrollment date, randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either an active treatment group or sham-control group. Patients will be followed for twelve months post-treatment to assess the primary effectiveness and safety endpoints of the study with data being collected at one, three, six, nine and twelve months. Patients randomized to the sham arm will be offered the opportunity to receive a Viveve treatment once they had completed the twelve-month evaluation following the sham intervention.
 
 10



The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the mean change from baseline in the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) total score at twelve months posttreatment. Secondary endpoints include evaluation of the mean change from baseline of the total FSFI score at six months, as well as evaluation of the mean change from baseline of the six different domains within the FSFI at six and twelve months. At months six and twelve, in addition to the FSFI, subjects will be asked to complete the Patient’s Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I). Subjects will also be assessed for adverse events throughout the study. The Company intends to report final twelve-month clinical data from the study in the second quarter of 2020.
 
Clinical Studies – Stress Urinary Incontinence
 
Canadian Pilot Study
 
In 2017, Viveve funded a single-arm investigator sponsored study to assess the effects of our CMRF technology in treating patients with mild-to-moderate SUI. The study was conducted in Calgary, Alberta and included 10 patients who underwent treatment with our CMRF technology under a proprietary treatment protocol. Patients were followed for 12 months with safety and clinical results reported at 4, 6, 9- and 12-months post-treatment. Clinical results included composite scores from the validated ICIQ-UI-SF (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire–Urinary Incontinence-Short Form) and UDI-6 (Urogenital Distress Inventory-Short Form) outcome questionnaires.
 
Results at 12 months (n=9) included an 89% responder rate (percentage of patients showing an improvement from baseline) for the ICIQ-UI-SF and a 100% responder rate on the UDI-6. Additionally, patients showed a 40% mean improvement on the ICIQ-UI-SF and a 51% mean improvement on the UDI-6 at 12 months across both validated endpoints. No device-related safety issues were reported in any of the patients.
 
Canadian Feasibility Study
 
In December 2018, we reported the results of a Viveve supported, single-arm, open label feasibility study that was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of our CMRF technology to improve urine leakage and quality of life associated with SUI. The study was conducted in Calgary, Alberta and included 37 patients who underwent treatment with our CMRF technology under a proprietary treatment protocol. Patients with mild to moderate SUI were treated with our proprietary treatment protocol and followed for 12 months with safety and clinical results reported at 3, 6, 9- and 12-months post-treatment. Clinical results included evaluation of the one-hour pad weight test, an FDA acceptable endpoint to assess the severity of and leakage associated with SUI, daily incontinence episodes, as well as composite scores from the validated UDI-6, IIQ-7 (Incontinence Impact Questionnaire), and ICIQ-UI-SF outcome questionnaires.
 
Results at 12 months (n=25) included a 72% responder rate (percentage of patients showing an improvement from baseline) on the one-hour pad weight test, a clinically meaningful benefit across all patient reported outcome measures, and a 64% reduction in daily incontinence episodes. Additionally, 52% of patients experienced greater than a 50% reduction in the one-hour pad weight test from baseline and 60% of patients had less than 1 gram of leakage at 12 months on the one-hour pad weight test. No device-related safety issues were reported in any of the patients.
 
This feasibility study showed a significant reduction of SUI symptoms by the 1-month time point and subjects reported durability of results lasting to the 12-month visit. While this study was on a small number of subjects, the Viveve treatment for SUI showed significant promise and as a result Viveve planned two additional trials in SUI.
 
LIBERATE - International 
 
In January 2019, enrollment was completed for the LIBERATE-International study in SUI. The study was conducted in Canada to support SUI indications in Canada, the European Union and several other international countries. LIBERATE International is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study conducted at 9 sites in Canada and included enrollment of 99 patients suffering from mild-to-moderate SUI. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either an active treatment group or sham-control group. Patients will be followed for six months post-treatment to assess the primary effectiveness and safety endpoints of the study with data being collected at one, three and six months.
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the 6-month change from baseline in the one-hour pad weight test, and the study protocol includes 6 months of safety follow-up, as well as assessments of other secondary endpoints, including: 24-hour pad weight test, daily incontinence episodes, as well as composite scores from the validated UDI-6, IIQ-7, and ICIQ-UI-SF outcome questionnaires.
 
Health Canada issued an authorization to conduct the investigational testing. The treatment portion of the trial has been completed, and if the results are favorable, the company expects to use the study for a registration filing in Canada, the EU and other countries outside the US for the improvement of SUI symptoms. There can be no assurance that any regulatory authority will approve our applications.

LIBERATE - US
 
In 2018, the Company submitted an IDE to conduct LIBERATE-US to the FDA. LIBERATE-US is intended to be a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study in up to 25 centers across the U.S. and including up to 240 patients who are suffering from mild-to-moderate SUI. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either an active treatment group or sham-control group. The primary efficacy endpoint is expected to be a comparison of the proportion of patients who experience greater than a 50% reduction in leakage at twelve months, as measured by the one-hour pad weight test, between the active treatment group and a sham control group. Additionally, the trial will include 12 months of safety follow-up, as well as assessments of other secondary endpoints. Currently, the Company is addressing requests for additional pre-clinical animal testing from the FDA. If the results of the pre-approval testing are favorable, the Company anticipates resubmitting the IDE in the second or third quarter of 2019.
 
The FDA must approve the Company’s IDE application before the Company may begin conducting the LIBERATE-US study. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve our IDE application, or that the FDA may not require that the protocols be changed or that additional pre-clinical work be conducted prior to approving the IDE.
 
Research and Development
 
We intend to focus on various research and development efforts, including but not limited to:
 

● | conducting additional human clinical trials, in order to support marketing applications for additional indications in the U.S. and internationally, including but not limited to SUI and vulvovaginal atrophy;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | implementing cost improvement programs to further increase gross margins and our gross profit opportunity; 
● | designing new treatment tips and system enhancements to further optimize ease-of-use and reduce procedure times for patients and physicians; and 
● | continuing to enhance the security within the Viveve System to prevent counterfeiting and refurbishment. 

 
We have formed strategic relationships with outside contractors for assistance on research and development projects, and we work closely with experts in the medical community to supplement our research and development resources. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $13,716,000 and $12,343,000, respectively. In the future, we expect to pursue further research and development initiatives to improve and extend our technological capabilities and to foster an environment of innovation and quality.
 
Manufacturing
 
Our manufacturing strategy involves the combined utilization of contract manufacturers, approved suppliers and internal manufacturing resources and expertise. We outsource the manufacture of components, subassemblies and finished products that are produced to our specifications and shipped to our Englewood, Colorado facility for inspection, testing and distribution. Our internal manufacturing activities include the testing of Viveve treatment tips and handpieces, as well as the final integration and system testing of the Viveve System. Our finished products are stored at and distributed from our Englewood, Colorado facility. 
 
We have arrangements with our suppliers that allow us to adjust the delivery quantities of components, subassemblies and finished products, as well as delivery schedules, to match our changing requirements. The forecasts we use are based on historical trends, current utilization patterns and sales forecasts of future demand. Lead times for components, subassemblies and finished products may vary significantly depending on the size of the order, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components and subassemblies. Most of our suppliers have no contractual obligations to supply us with, and we are not contractually obligated to purchase from them, the components used in our devices.
 
Our first commercial Viveve system which consists of a generator, handpiece and disposable tip was designed and is currently manufactured by Stellartech Research Corporation (“Stellartech”). Stellartech is the sole source supplier for this version of the Viveve system. We have manufacturing, quality and regulatory agreements with Stellartech that define the relationship and responsibilities of both parties in these areas. We also have technology licenses with Stellartech that are discussed in the Patents and Proprietary Technology section of this document.
 
Our second generation Viveve system consists of a generator and handpiece designed and manufactured by Sparton Corporation (“Sparton”), and a disposable treatment tip designed and manufactured by Cirtec Corporation (“Cirtec”). Both Sparton and Cirtec are sole source suppliers for their respective components. We have a Professional Services Agreement with Sparton that governs the design and development relationship and a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement that defines our manufacturing, shipping and servicing relationship. We manage our relationship with Cirtec with long range (12 month) forecasts and purchase orders
 
 12



In addition to our primary system suppliers, we also have critical suppliers at the component level. We obtain proprietary flexible electronic circuits for our treatment tips and the coolant valve for the handpiece from single suppliers (AllFlex and Lee Valve Co.), for which we attempt to mitigate risks through inventory management and either long term supply agreements or 12- to 18-month purchase orders. We currently have two sterilization vendors to mitigate risks. Other products and components come from single suppliers, but alternate suppliers have been qualified or, we believe, can be readily identified and qualified. To date, shipments of finished products to our customers have not been significantly delayed due to material delays in obtaining any of our components, subassemblies or finished products.
 
We are required to manufacture our product in compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 820 (“21 CFR 820”) enacted by the FDA (known as the Quality System Regulation or QSR). 21 CFR 820 regulates the methods and documentation relating to the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our product. We maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our product in the member states of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association and countries which have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the European Union. These certifications include EN ISO 9001:2000 and CAN/CSA ISO 13485:2003. We are also required to maintain our product registration in a number of other foreign markets such as Canada.
 
We use small quantities of common cleaning products in our manufacturing operations, which are lawfully disposed of through a routine waste management program. Except for costs that may be incurred in the future in connection with environmental regulations requiring the phase out of R134a, a hydrofluorocarbon, or HFC, upon which our cooling module relies, we do not anticipate any material costs due to compliance with environmental laws or regulations. In 2007, the European Union enacted directives aimed at the automotive industry for the removal of HFC's from air conditioning. As a result of these directives, we anticipate that similar directives may be imposed on the medical device industry over the next decade. In anticipation of future restrictions, we have qualified a more environmentally friendly HFC (1234ZE) for use in our generators. We do not anticipate that we will have to incur costs in the near future to develop an alternative cooling module for our device which is not dependent on HFCs. If and when we are required to do so, and if we do not do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, the Viveve System may not be in compliance with environmental regulations, which could result in fines, civil penalties and the inability to sell our products in certain major international markets.
 
We generally offer a one-year warranty providing for the repair, rework or replacement (at the Company’s option) of products that fail to perform within stated specifications. To the extent that any of our components have performance related or technical issues in the field, we typically replace those components as necessary. We also sell a small number of extended service agreements on certain products for the period subsequent to the normal one-year warranty provided with the original product sale. Warranties are assessed for proper revenue recognition.  Most warranties are classified as assurance type warranties thereby allowing immediate recognition of revenue with accrual for estimated future warranty expenses. Revenue from sale of such extended service agreements was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 
Patents and Proprietary Technology
 
We rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and the Viveve System. We have an exclusive license (with a field of use limitation) to one issue U.S. patent and own 3 issued U.S. patents directed to our technology and the Viveve System. Additionally, we have 9 pending U.S. patent applications, 65 issued foreign patents, and 32 pending foreign patent applications, some of which foreign applications preserve an opportunity to pursue patent rights in multiple countries.

Edward Knowlton Licensed Patents
 
On February 10, 2006, Viveve, Inc. entered into an Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement with Edward W. Knowlton (“Knowlton”), as amended on May 22, 2006 and July 20, 2007 (collectively, the “Knowlton IP Agreement”), pursuant to which Knowlton granted to Viveve, Inc. an exclusive, royalty-free and perpetual worldwide sublicense to certain intellectual property and technology licensed to Knowlton from a third party, including rights to several patents and patent applications owned by Thermage, Inc. outside the field of contraction, remodeling and ablation of the skin through and including (but not beyond) the subcutaneous fat layer below the skin (collectively, the “Knowlton Licensed IP”). The sublicense under the Knowlton Licensed IP is fully-paid, transferable, sublicensable and permits us to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import any product or technology solely for use in the field of transmucosal treatment of the vagina or vulva (the “Field”) and to practice any process, method, or procedure solely in the Field. The Knowlton IP Agreement also assigns to us all technology and related intellectual property rights owned by Knowlton for the development and commercialization of devices, including any improvements, in the Field (the “Knowlton Assigned IP”). We are obligated to file and reasonably prosecute any patent applications that include a description of the Knowlton Assigned IP as prior art and maintain all patents included in the Knowlton Assigned IP, at our expense. In consideration of the sale, assignment, transfer, release and conveyance and other obligations of Knowlton under the Knowlton IP Agreement, Viveve, Inc. issued 200,000 shares of our common stock to Knowlton and agreed to engage the consulting services of Knowlton.
 
Also on February 10, 2006, Viveve, Inc. entered into a Consulting Agreement with Knowlton (“Knowlton Consulting Agreement”), pursuant to which Knowlton assigned all rights to any inventions and intellectual property developed during the course of providing consulting services in the Field during the term of the agreement. Unless earlier terminated pursuant to the provisions described therein, the term of the Knowlton Consulting Agreement continued until the earlier to occur of (i) the date that is six months after the closing of an initial public offering of Viveve, Inc.’s stock; or (ii) the acquisition by a third party of all or substantially all of the business or assets of Viveve, Inc., whether by asset or stock acquisition, merger, consolidation or otherwise. The agreement could be renewed only upon the mutual written agreement of the parties prior to its expiration. The Knowlton Consulting Agreement expired by its terms on September 23, 2014. The assignment of the intellectual property developed during the term of the Knowlton Consulting Agreement survives termination.
 
Agreement with Stellartech Research Corporation
 
On June 12, 2006, Viveve, Inc. entered into the Stellartech Agreement, as amended and restated on October 4, 2007, with Stellartech for an initial term of three years in connection with the performance of development and manufacturing services by Stellartech and the license of certain technology and intellectual property rights to each party. Under the Stellartech Agreement, we agreed to purchase 300 units of generators manufactured by Stellartech. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has purchased 809 units. In conjunction with the Agreement, Stellartech purchased 37,500 shares of Viveve, Inc.’s common stock at $0.008. Under the Stellartech Agreement, we paid Stellartech $10,150,000 and $7,912,000 for goods and services during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, Stellartech granted to us a non-exclusive, nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free license in the Field (defined above in the discussions titled “Edward Knowlton Licensed Patents”) to use Stellartech’s technology incorporated into deliverables or products developed, manufactured or sold by Stellartech to us pursuant to the Stellartech Agreement (the “Stellartech Products”) to use, sell, offer for sale, import and distribute the Stellartech Products within the Field, including the use of software object code incorporated into the Stellartech Products. The Stellartech technology consists of know-how applicable to the manufacturing and repair of the Viveve System, including any other intellectual property which Stellartech developed or acquired separate and apart from the Stellartech Agreement and all related derivative works. In addition, once we purchase a minimum commitment of 300 units of the RF generator component (the “Minimum Commitment”) and the Stellartech Agreement expires, Stellartech is to grant us a nonexclusive, nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid license to use the Stellartech technology incorporated into the Stellartech Products to make and have made Stellartech Products in the Field.
 
Stellartech also granted (i) an exclusive (even as to Stellartech), nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free license within the Field under those certain intellectual property rights licensed to Stellartech pursuant to a development and supply agreement between Stellartech and Thermage, dated October 1, 1997 (the “Thermage Technology”), to use any elements of the Thermage Technology incorporated into the Stellartech Products, solely for the use, sale, offer for sale, importation and distribution within the Field; (ii) upon our satisfaction of the Minimum Commitment and the expiration of the Stellartech Agreement, an exclusive, nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid license within the Field under Stellartech’s license rights in the Thermage Technology to use any elements of the Thermage Technology which are incorporated into the Stellartech Products to make and have made Stellartech Products in the Field; and (iii) the exclusive right within the Field to prosecute infringers of the portion of Stellartech’s Thermage Technology rights exclusively licensed to us. Our license rights in Thermage Technology also include the use of software object code for Thermage Technology used in the Stellartech Products. As of the date of this report, the Stellartech Agreement has expired by its terms, however, the parties still continue to operate under the terms of the agreement. In addition, we have met the Minimum Commitment requirement, and therefore we are permitted to use the Stellartech technology with any other manufacturer. If Stellartech refuses or is unable to meet our delivery requirements for the Viveve System, our business could be materially adversely affected.
 
 14



In March 2012, Viveve, Inc. entered into a Quality and Regulatory Agreement with Stellartech, pursuant to which the parties clarified their respective quality and regulatory responsibilities under the Stellartech Agreement. The Quality and Regulatory Agreement provides that we will serve as the legal manufacturer for all Stellartech Products developed and sold to us thereunder and that we are obligated to maintain all relevant quality assurance and regulatory processes and requirements required by any regulatory authority and to comply with the processes and requirements set forth in the schedule of responsibilities provided in the agreement.

Sales of our product outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, exports of medical devices from the U.S. are regulated by the FDA. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process and approval is not certain. The time required to obtain registrations or approvals, as required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for such registrations or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. We may be unable to obtain or maintain registrations or approvals in other countries. We may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals. If we experience delays in receiving necessary registrations or approvals to market our product outside the U.S., or if we fail to receive those registrations or approvals, we may be unable to market our product or enhancements in international markets effectively, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth strategy.
 
An entity that seeks to export a medical device that is legally marketed in the U.S. (e.g., an FDA cleared Class II medical device) may do so without prior FDA notification or approval.
 
Because the Viveve System has been cleared by the FDA for “use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis,” Viveve does not obtain approval from the FDA prior to exporting the device to foreign countries. Additionally, products exported from the U.S. and those with certain levels of U.S. content are subject to the U.S. export control and sanctions laws and regulations, which may restrict proposed transactions to certain countries, end-users and end-uses. Certain products may be controlled for export and reexport and may require licensing or other authorization from the U.S. government prior to engaging in the export or reexport transaction. Changes to these regulations may impact the ability to pursue potential opportunities to export and reexport the products overseas.
 
Moreover, entities legally exporting products from the U.S. are often asked by foreign customers or foreign governments to supply an export certificate issued by the FDA to accompany a device. An export certificate is a document prepared by the FDA containing information about a product’s regulatory or marketing status in the U.S. We have requested the issuance of export certificates to allow exports into many countries around the world, and the FDA has issued those export certificates to us. Accordingly, we provide export certificates to many of our foreign customers.

FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
 
Unless an exemption applies, any medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require premarket clearance from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. The classification system is risk based, with devices deemed to pose the lowest risk being Class I, and devices posing the most risk being Class III. Most Class I devices are exempt from the requirement to obtain FDA premarket clearance or approval. For most Class II devices (and a small number of Class I devices), a company must submit to the FDA a premarket notification (known as 510(k) submission) requesting clearance to commercially distribute the device. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) devices, are placed in Class III, requiring either FDA premarket approval via a Premarket Approval (“PMA”) application or a De Novo petition requesting that the FDA reclassify the device into a lower class (i.e., Class II or Class I). The FDA has issued regulations identifying the Class into which different types of devices fall and identifying whether the device type is exempt from the 510(k) process or if a 510(k) is needed.
510(k) Clearance Pathway
 
When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that our device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared and legally marketed device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMAs (known as a predicate device). The FDA strives to make a determination that the device is substantially equivalent (SE) (i.e., clear the device) or not substantially equivalent (NSE) within 90 days of submission of the notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, the FDA will issue an NSE letter and place the device into Class III. If the device is placed into Class III automatically based only on the lack of a predicate device and the device is lower risk, a De Novo submission may be submitted petitioning the FDA to reclassify the device into Class II or Class I, as appropriate.
 
Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that would constitute a major change in its intended use, or any change that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, requires a new 510(k) clearance and may even, in some circumstances, require a PMA, if the change raises complex or novel scientific issues or the product has a new intended use. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make the determination regarding the need for a new 510(k) submission in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer’s decision. If the FDA were to disagree with a manufacturer’s determination that changes did not require a new 510(k), the FDA could require the manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA clearance is obtained and the manufacturer could be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 
In December 2008, a predecessor company to Viveve received 510(k) clearance for a previous version of the Viveve System. Since then, we have made design modifications to the original 510(k)-cleared device. In March 2015, we submitted a Special 510(k) to the FDA seeking clearance for the updated Viveve System to take into account the design modifications to the original 510(k)-cleared device, which included improved user interface capabilities and enhanced manufacturability. In October 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to sell the updated device for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis. In 2017 we received clearance to add an 8 cm tip to the product family.

De Novo Process
 
If FDA has not issued a regulation classifying a particular type of device as Class I, and if there is no known predicate for a device (i.e., a legally-marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval with comparable indications for use and technological characteristics), the device is automatically Class III, regardless of the risk the device poses. If a device is automatically/statutorily classified into Class III in this manner, a company can petition FDA to reclassify the category of devices into Class II or Class I via a process known as “Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” which is typically referred to as the “de novo process.” The direct de novo process allows a company to request that a new product classification be established without the company first submitting a 510(k) notification for the device. The reclassification petition should include a risk-benefit analysis demonstrating that, when subject to general controls or general and special controls, the probable benefits to health from use of the device outweigh any probable injury or illness from such use. The submitter also must describe why general controls or general and special controls are adequate to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and for proposed Class II devices, provide proposed special controls. If a product is classified as Class II through the de novo review process, then that device may serve as a predicate device for subsequent 510(k) premarket notifications, including by competitors.
 
We intend to seek FDA authorization to market the Viveve System for the treatment of vaginal tissue to improve sexual function and to improve SUI by utilizing the direct de novo process. However, we cannot predict when or if approval of such a petition will be obtained. In addition, if FDA fails to grant a de novo petition, we will be required to seek FDA premarket approval (via the more stringent PMA process). Delays in receipt of FDA clearance or failure to receive FDA clearance or approval for expanded indication could reduce our sales, profitability and future growth prospects.
 
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support an FDA de novo reclassification and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. With respect to the Viveve System, the FDA has asked us to conduct a clinical study under an IDE, to support a future product submission (e.g., a 510(k) or a de novo petition) for the sexual function indication. In the U.S., clinical trials on medical devices generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA if the device is a “significant risk” device. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by both the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards (“IRBs”) at the clinical trial sites. Our clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB at the relevant clinical trial sites and in accordance with FDA regulations, including, but not limited to, those relating to good clinical practices. We are also required to obtain the patients’ informed consent, in compliance with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy regulations. We, the FDA, or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain clearance or approval of the product. Similarly, in Europe and other regions, clinical study protocols must be approved by the local ethics committee and in some cases, including studies with high-risk devices, by the Ministry of Health in the applicable country.
 
In June 2012, we submitted a pre-IDE application and requested an in-person meeting with the FDA to solicit feedback in advance of filing an IDE to conduct a clinical study of the Viveve System to support regulatory submission for the sexual function indication. In August 2012, we met with the FDA and received feedback on our pre-clinical data, historical clinical data, and a clinical protocol for a prospective randomized controlled trial. We had a second meeting with the FDA on December 17, 2015 and received additional feedback on our clinical protocol design and indication for use. In September 2016 we submitted an IDE application to FDA to begin a U.S. clinical study and the FDA has responded with additional questions regarding the proposed protocol and other aspects of the clinical study design, which we addressed. Approval of the IDE was received in 2018, and we began our U.S. clinical study to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device to improve sexual function.  Completion of enrollment for the clinical study is anticipated in March 2019.
 
Continuing Regulation
 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate regulatory inspections and other regulatory action; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission of Unique Device Identifiers (UDIs) or the equivalent to regulatory authorities; 
● | Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Quality System Regulations (QSRs), which require those who design, manufacture, package, label, store, install, and service devices to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of these processes;
● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses to both physician and consumers; 

 
 17




● | regulations governing our interactions with healthcare practitioners; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | U.S. export control and sanctions regulations associated with the export and reexport of the products; 
● | complaint handling and adverse event reporting requirements, such as the Medical Device Reporting (MDR), regulations in the U.S., which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if its device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; 
● | regulations pertaining to recalls and notices of corrections or removals; and 
● | any other post-market requirements that the FDA or foreign regulatory bodies might impose as part of the device approval or clearance process. 

 
The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We and our third-party manufacturers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and foreign governments or designated representatives to determine compliance with the quality system requirements and other regulations. In the past, our Sunnyvale, California facility (now closed) was inspected, and observations were noted, including an April 2012 California Department of Public Health (CDPH) inspection that cited deficiencies related to signature authority of inspection documentation, incomplete corrective action responses, and labeling indicating that our product contained no latex without proper objective evidence. The FDA and CDRH have accepted our responses to these observations, and we believe that we and our third-party manufacturer are in substantial compliance with the QSR.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, states, or foreign governments, which may include any of the following actions:
 

● | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products; 
● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
● | refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo reclassification, or premarket approval of new products or new intended uses; 
● | refusing to grant export certificates for our product; 
● | reclassifying a device that previously received a 510(k) clearance or withdrawing premarket approvals that are already granted; and
● | criminal prosecution. 

 
If any of these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
We are also subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to distribution of medical devices, the environment, health and safety, fraud and abuse, land use, advertising, and quality assurance. We believe that compliance with these laws and regulations as currently in effect will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
 
Competition
 
The medical device industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. While we believe that our solutions to treat vaginal laxity and SUI are unique and offer a more effective treatment options from that which is on the market currently, we also believe that the market for the treatment of vaginal laxity, women’s sexual function, and incontinence remain tremendous, under-developed opportunities. Therefore, competition is expected to increase, particularly as the market becomes further developed with additional treatment options. Aside from Kegel exercises and invasive surgical procedures, such as LVR, fillers, bulking agents, slings, and mesh there are many companies that may be developing or that have developed energy-based technologies for vaginal use as well as others developing modalities for the treatment of female sexual dysfunction and incontinence. Further, the overall size and attractiveness of the market may compel larger companies focused in the Urology, OB/GYN, aesthetic or women’s health markets, and with much greater capital and other resources, to pursue development of or acquire technologies that may address these indications. Potential energy-based competitors include, but are not limited to, Hologic, Syneron Medical, Fotona, Thermi Aesthetics, Cutera, Inmode, BTL, Venus Concepts and others, some of whom have more established products and customer relationships than we have.

Employees
 
As of March 8, 2019, we had 67 full-time employees and we retain the services of several qualified consultants. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
Continuance into Delaware
 
On July 22, 2015, at our 2015 Annual and Special Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved a special resolution authorizing a continuance of the Company (the “Continuance”) into the State of Delaware under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) and the adoption of charter documents that comply with the DGCL in connection therewith, effective as of a date to be determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, no more than 12 months from the date of the meeting. On May 9, 2016, the Company filed the necessary Application for Authorization to Continue into Another Jurisdiction and Statutory Declaration with the Yukon registrar. On May 10, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Conversion and Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to move its domicile from the Yukon Territory to Delaware.
 
The Continuance did not involve any change in our business, properties, corporate headquarters or management. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Continuance continued to serve as our officers following the Continuance, and the current members of the Board of Directors continued to serve as the members of the Board following the Continuance. There was no change in our operations, assets, liabilities or obligations as a result of the Continuance. Other than the approval of our stockholders and the filings with the Yukon Registrar of Corporations and the Secretary of State of Delaware, there were no federal or state regulatory requirements that we were required to comply with or approvals that we were required to obtain in connection with the Continuance.
 
Upon the effectiveness of the Continuance, each outstanding share of our common stock continued to be an outstanding share of our common stock as incorporated in Delaware and each outstanding option, right or warrant to acquire shares of our common stock continued to be an option, right or warrant to acquire an equal number of shares of common stock under the same terms and conditions. Upon effectiveness of the Continuance, we were governed by the Certificate of Incorporation filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware and by bylaws prepared in accordance with the DGCL, which were approved by our stockholders at the 2015 Annual and Special Meeting. Following the Continuance, we were governed by the DGCL instead of the Yukon Business Corporation Act.
