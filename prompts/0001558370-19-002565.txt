 ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
     Unless the context otherwise requires, “G-III,” “us,” “we” and “our” refer to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries. References to fiscal years refer to the year ended or ending on January 31 of that year. For example, our fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 is referred to as “fiscal 2019.”
     G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. is a Delaware corporation that was formed in 1989. We and our predecessors have conducted our business since 1974.
     All share and per share data in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect our two-for-one stock split effected on May 1, 2015.
     Overview
     G-III designs, sources and markets an extensive range of apparel, including outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women’s suits and women’s performance wear, as well as women’s handbags, footwear, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. G-III has a substantial portfolio of more than 30 licensed and proprietary brands, anchored by five global power brands: DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld Paris. We are not only licensees, but also brand owners, and we distribute our products through multiple channels of distribution including brick and mortar and online channels.
     Our own proprietary brands include DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Eliza J and Jessica Howard. We sell products under an extensive portfolio of well-known licensed brands, including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan, Guess?, Vince Camuto, Levi’s and Dockers. Through our team sports business, we have licenses with the National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Starter and over 150 U.S. colleges and universities. We also sell products under private retail labels for retailers such as Costco, Ross Stores and Nordstrom. 
     Our products are sold through a cross section of leading retailers such as Macy’s, Dillard’s, Hudson’s Bay Company, including their Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue divisions, Nordstrom, TJX Companies, Ross Stores and Burlington. We also sell our products over the web through retail partners such as macys.com and nordstrom.com, each of which has a substantial online business. In addition, we sell to pure play online retail partners such as Amazon and Fanatics.
     We also distribute apparel and other products through our own retail stores. Substantially all of our DKNY, Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass stores are operated as outlet stores. As of January 31, 2019, we operated 139 Wilsons Leather stores, 111 G.H. Bass stores, 42 DKNY stores, 11 Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores and 5 Calvin Klein Performance stores, of which 300 were located in the continental United States and 8 are located internationally. Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass, DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris each operates its own online store. In addition, as of January 31, 2019, Vilebrequin products were distributed through 96 company-operated stores, as well as through 68 franchised locations and e-commerce stores in Europe and the United States.
     Segments
     We report based on two segments: wholesale operations and retail operations.
     Our wholesale operations segment includes sales of products under brands licensed by us from third parties and sales of products under our own brands and private label brands, as well as sales related to the Vilebrequin business. Wholesale revenues also include royalty revenues from license agreements related to trademarks owned by the DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass and Andrew Marc businesses.
     Our retail operations segment includes direct sales to consumers through company-operated stores and product sales through our owned websites for the DKNY, Donna Karan, Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and Karl Lagerfeld Paris businesses. Our retail operations segment consists primarily of our Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and DKNY stores, substantially all of which are operated as outlet stores, as well as a limited number of Calvin Klein Performance and Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores.

 Strategic Initiatives
 We are focused on the following strategic initiatives, which we believe are critical to our long-term success:
    
· | Owning brands: We now own a portfolio of proprietary brands, including DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass and Andrew Marc. Owning our own brands is advantageous to us for several reasons:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | We can realize significantly higher operating margins because we are not required to pay licensing fees on sales by us of our proprietary products and can also generate licensing revenues (which have no related cost of goods sold) for classes of products not manufactured by us.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | There are no channel restrictions, permitting us to market our products internationally, and to utilize a variety of different distribution channels, including online and off-price channels.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | We are able to license our proprietary brands in new categories and geographies to best in class licensees.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | We are able to build equity in these brands to benefit the long-term interests of our stockholders.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focusing on our five global power brands: While we sell products under more than 30 licensed and proprietary brands, five global power brands anchor our business: DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld Paris. Each of these brands has substantial name recognition and is well-known in the marketplace. We believe each brand also provides us with significant growth opportunities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expanding our international business: We continue to expand our international business and enter into new markets worldwide. We believe that the international sales and profit opportunity is quite significant for our DKNY and Donna Karan businesses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increasing online business opportunities: We are continuing to make changes to our business to address the additional challenges and opportunities created by the evolving role of the online marketplace in the retail sector and expect to increase the sale of our products in an omni-channel environment. We are investing in digital personnel, marketing, logistics, planning and distribution. We believe that consumers are increasingly engaging with brands through online channels, and that this trend will continue to grow in the coming years. The five global power brands that serve as the anchor of our business position us to be the direct beneficiaries of this trend, whether by continuing to leverage our partnerships with the online businesses operated by our licensors and major retailers to facilitate customer engagement or by building out our own online capabilities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reducing the losses in our retail business: We are also focusing on significantly reducing the losses of our retail business with the goal of attaining profitability by terminating or renegotiating long-term leases as they come up for renewal, implementing cost-cutting initiatives, revising our merchandising strategies and repurposing certain Wilsons and G.H. Bass stores for our Karl Lagerfeld Paris or DKNY brands. We also hired a new President of our retail business who is an industry veteran with a proven track record at leading retailers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The ongoing development of the DKI businesses serves as a pillar of our strategic efforts. The acquisition of DKI added two proprietary power brands to our growing portfolio and the ability to expand our footprint globally, while enabling us to compete more effectively in omni-channel retail. The acquisition of DKI fit squarely into our strategy to diversify and expand our business and to increase our ownership of brands. We believe that DKNY and Donna Karan are two of the most iconic and recognizable power brands and that we are well positioned to unlock their potential, resulting in a much bigger opportunity than their previous management had realized. We are focusing on the expansion of the DKNY brand, while continuing to re-establish Donna Karan and other associated brands. We are leveraging our demonstrated ability to drive organic growth and develop talent throughout our company to maximize the potential of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands. 
     In fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, we restructured and repositioned the DKNY and Donna Karan brands.  We re-launched the DKNY apparel line and also re-launched Donna Karan as an aspirational luxury brand that is priced above DKNY and targeted to fine department stores globally. These steps began paying off in the second half of fiscal 2018 and through fiscal 2019. Our strategy is for DKNY and Donna Karan to be more accessible brands, both designed and priced to reach a wider range of customers. We believe there is untapped global licensing and distribution potential for these brands and intend to grow royalty streams in the DKNY and Donna Karan businesses through expansion of additional categories with existing licensees, as well as new categories with new licensees. We are committed to making DKNY the premier fashion and lifestyle brand.

 We also entered into a joint venture to produce and market women’s and men’s apparel and accessories under a long-term license for DKNY and Donna Karan in the People’s Republic of China, including Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The operators of the joint venture were formerly executives of Tommy Hilfiger and were instrumental in the expansion of the Tommy Hilfiger brand in China. This joint venture is the exclusive seller of women’s and men’s apparel, handbags, luggage and certain accessories under the DKNY and Donna Karan brands in the territory. The joint venture commenced operations in the second half of fiscal 2018 and was operating approximately 50 points of sale as of January 31, 2019.
     The acquisition of DKI was not our only recent important strategic initiative. We have continually expanded our relationship with Calvin Klein, our most important license relationship representing over $1 billion of our sales in fiscal 2019. Initially, we had licenses for Calvin Klein men’s and women’s outerwear. We subsequently added licenses for women’s suits, dresses, women’s performance wear, women’s better sportswear, men’s and women’s swimwear, women’s handbags and small leather goods and luggage, as well as to operate Calvin Klein Performance retail stores in the United States.
     We have continued to expand our partnership with the Karl Lagerfeld Paris brand as we now design, source and produce women’s apparel, women’s handbags, men’s apparel and women’s and men’s footwear. We have expanded our licensing relationship with Tommy Hilfiger which includes all women’s apparel categories (excluding intimates, sleepwear and accessories) in the United States and Canada. This expansion complemented our other Tommy Hilfiger licenses for men’s and women’s outerwear and luggage.
     Competitive Strengths
     We believe that retailers today are seeking resources with the size and power to partner effectively on all aspects of the supply chain, from design, sourcing and quality control to logistics and warehousing. We believe that G-III is a partner of choice in these endeavors, and that we are able to capitalize on the following competitive strengths to expand our position as an all-season diversified apparel company:
     Broad portfolio of recognized brands.  In an environment of rapidly changing consumer fashion trends, we benefit from a balanced mix of more than 30 licensed and proprietary brands anchored by five global power brands: DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld Paris. We believe we are a licensee of choice for well-known brands, as demonstrated by our partnerships with such brands as Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan, Guess?, Vince Camuto, Levi’s and Dockers that have built a loyal following of both fashion-conscious consumers and retailers who desire high quality, well designed products. In addition to our licensed brands, we own a number of proprietary brands, including DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Eliza J and Jessica Howard. Our experience in developing and acquiring licensed brands and proprietary labels, as well as our reputation for producing high quality, well-designed apparel, has led major department stores and retailers to select us as a designer and manufacturer for their own private label programs.

      Diversified distribution base.  We market our products at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution, allowing us to provide products to a broad range of consumers. Our products are sold to approximately 2,000 customers, including a cross section of retailers such as Macy’s, Dillard’s, Hudson’s Bay Company, including their Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue divisions, Nordstrom, TJX Companies, Ross Stores and Burlington, as well as membership clubs such as Costco and Sam’s Club. We also sell to pure play online retail partners such as Amazon and Fanatics. Our strong relationships with retailers have been established through many years of personal customer service and adherence to meeting or exceeding retailer expectations.
     In addition to selling our products through a diverse range of other retailers, our store network provides us with our own retail channel. We recognize that the retail landscape continues to evolve, and we are changing our retail strategy to significantly reduce our losses with the goal of attaining profitability in this segment. We are in the process of executing a turn-around of this segment of our business, including the termination and renegotiation of long-term leases as they come up for renewal, overall cost cutting, improved merchandising strategies and re-purposing certain Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass stores for our Karl Lagerfeld Paris and/or DKNY brands. We have hired a new President of our retail business who is an industry veteran with a proven track record at leading retailers. In addition, we continue to make changes to our business to address the additional challenges and opportunities created by the evolving role of the online marketplace in the retail sector and expect to expand the sale of our products in an omni-channel environment. 
     Superior design, sourcing and quality control.  Our in-house design and merchandising teams design substantially all of our licensed, proprietary and private label products. Our designers work closely with our licensors and private label customers to create designs and styles that represent the look they want. We have a network of worldwide suppliers that allows us to negotiate competitive terms without relying on any single vendor. In addition, we employ a quality control team and a sourcing group in China to ensure the quality of our products. We believe we have developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry as a result of our design capabilities, sourcing expertise, on-time delivery and high standards of quality control.
     Leadership position in the wholesale business.  As one of the largest wholesalers of outerwear, dresses and sportswear, we are widely recognized within the apparel industry for our high-quality and well-designed products. Our expertise and reputation in designing, sourcing and marketing apparel has enabled us to build strong customer relationships and to become one of the leading dress and sportswear suppliers in the United States over the past several years. We have also expanded into other women’s and men’s apparel categories, as well as to non-apparel categories such as handbags, footwear, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage.

 Experienced management team.  Our executive management team has worked together for a significant period of time and has extensive experience in the apparel industry.

Miller, our Chief Operating Officer, has been with us for over 20 years, Neal S. Nackman, our Chief Financial Officer, has been with us for 15 years and Jeffrey Goldfarb, our Executive Vice President, has been with us for over 15 years. Our leadership team has demonstrated experience in successfully acquiring, managing, integrating and positioning new businesses having completed nine acquisitions and several joint ventures over the last 14 years, while also adding numerous new licenses and licensed products.
     Wholesale Operations
     Licensed Products
     The sale of licensed products is a key element of our strategy and we have continually expanded our offerings of licensed products for more than 25 years. In August 2018, we renewed our license agreements with Guess? for an additional five-year term and in September 2018, we renewed our license agreement with Kenneth Cole for an additional four-year term. We also recently extended our license agreements with the National Hockey League through 2022 and for the Starter brand through 2023. Further, in November 2018, we were granted an additional five-year renewal option for our Vince Camuto dress license, through 2025.

 We believe that consumers prefer to buy brands they know, and we have continually sought licenses that would increase the portfolio of name brands we can offer through different tiers of retail distribution, for a wide array of products at a variety of price points. We believe that brand owners are looking to consolidate the number of licensees they engage to develop product and to choose licensees who have a successful track record of developing brands. We continue to seek other opportunities to enter into license agreements in order to expand our product offerings under well-known labels and broaden the markets that we serve.
     Under our license agreements, we are generally required to achieve minimum net sales of licensed products, pay guaranteed minimum royalties, make specified royalty and advertising payments (usually based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products), and receive prior approval of the licensor as to all design and other elements of a product prior to production. License agreements also may restrict our ability to enter into other license agreements for competing products or acquire businesses that produce competing products without the consent of the licensor. If we do not satisfy any of these requirements or otherwise fail to meet our obligations under a license agreement, a licensor usually will have the right to terminate our license. License agreements also typically restrict our ability to assign or transfer the agreement without the prior written consent of a licensor and generally provide that a change in control, including as a result of the acquisition of us by another company, is considered to be a transfer of the license agreement that would give a licensor the right to terminate the license unless it has approved the transaction. Our ability to renew the current term of a license agreement may be subject to the discretion of the licensor or to attaining minimum sales and/or royalty levels and to our compliance with the provisions of the agreement.
     Proprietary Brands
     Dating back to the beginning of our company, G-III has sold apparel under its own proprietary brands. Over the years, we developed or acquired brands such as G-III Sports by Carl Banks, Eliza J and Jessica Howard. We acquired Andrew Marc, an aspirational luxury outerwear brand, G.H. Bass, a well-known heritage brand, and Vilebrequin, which provides us with a premier brand selling status products worldwide. Most recently, we acquired DKI, which owns DKNY and Donna Karan, two of the world’s most iconic and recognizable power brands.
     DKNY and Donna Karan
     The DKI business has a portfolio of some of the world’s most iconic fashion brands, including DKNY and Donna Karan. First launched in 1984, DKI designed, sourced, marketed, retailed, and distributed collections of women’s and men’s clothing, sportswear, accessories and shoes under the DKNY and Donna Karan brand names until it was acquired by G-III in 2016.
     Based on DKNY’s and Donna Karan’s significant brand equity, we believe there are opportunities to expand existing categories, launch new initiatives and develop a strong licensing and distribution base. We believe that the DKNY brand has the potential for significant growth. In addition, other areas for growth include the relaunch of Donna Karan, as well as increased licensing revenues. We expect sales growth across many categories of the business.
     During fiscal 2019, we mutually agreed with Macy’s to end their exclusivity with respect to our DKNY brand. While we plan to expand the reach of this brand into additional department stores in North America, we expect Macy’s to remain a significant customer of DKNY products and play a major part in DKNY’s growth initiatives.
     Our DKNY products are designed to provide a total wardrobe for a woman’s active, modern lifestyle. Products developed reflect the DKNY brand DNA and emphasize a strong price-value relationship. We believe that DKNY has the potential to be the premier fashion and lifestyle brand. DKNY products produced by us or by our various licensees are sold through department stores, specialty retailers and online retailers worldwide, as well as through company-operated retail stores, e-commerce sites and international brand partners and distributors.
     We believe that the Donna Karan brand offers significant growth potential. We re-launched Donna Karan as an aspirational luxury brand that is priced above DKNY and targeted to fine department stores located in the United States, such as Dillard’s, Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Bloomingdales, as well as fine department stores internationally.

 The acquisition of DKI provided us an opportunity to expand our online retail channels. We believe there are significant opportunities to focus and enhance the DKNY and Donna Karan websites, prudently expand retail stores over the long term, including through conversion of stores within the existing G-III retail base, and capitalize on industry relationships to ensure premium placement for certain product categories in department and other retail stores nationwide. 
     Vilebrequin
     Vilebrequin is a premier provider of status swimwear, resort wear and related accessories. Vilebrequin sells its products in over 90 countries around the world. Vilebrequin has also licensed its brand internationally for a denim line. We believe that Vilebrequin has the potential to significantly develop its distribution network worldwide and expand its product offerings. A majority of Vilebrequin’s current revenues are derived from sales in Europe and the United States. As of January 31, 2019, Vilebrequin products were distributed through 96 company-operated stores, plus e-commerce websites in each of Europe and the United States, as well as through 68 franchised locations and e-commerce stores and select wholesale distribution.
     Vilebrequin’s iconic designs and reputation are linked to its French Riviera heritage arising from its founding in St. Tropez over forty years ago. Vilebrequin’s men’s swimwear, which accounts for the majority of its sales, is known for its exclusive prints, wide range of colors, attention to detail, fabric quality and well-designed cut. In addition to swimwear, Vilebrequin sells a line of resort wear products, including shirts, T-shirts, Bermuda shorts and trousers, and related accessories, including hats, beach bags, beach towels, shoes, sunglasses and watches. Vilebrequin also offers a collection of women’s swimwear and resort wear. We believe that Vilebrequin is a powerful brand. We plan to continue adding more company operated and franchised retail locations and increase our wholesale distribution of Vilebrequin product throughout the world, as well as develop the business beyond its heritage in men’s swimwear, resort wear and related accessories.
     Licensing of Proprietary Brands
 As our portfolio of propriety brands has grown, we have licensed these brands in new categories. We began licensing Andrew Marc, Vilebrequin and G.H. Bass in selected categories after acquiring these brands. Our licensing program has significantly increased as a result of owning the DKNY and Donna Karan brands.
     We currently license the DKNY and Donna Karan brands for a broad array of products in the U.S. and internationally including fragrance, hosiery, intimates, eyewear, jewelry, home furnishings and sleepwear. The DKNY brand is licensed in the U.S. and internationally for children’s clothing, watches and men’s tailored clothing. We have strong relationships with category leading license partners, including Estee Lauder, Fossil, PVH Corp. (“PVH”) and Hanesbrands. We have also licensed DKNY and Donna Karan’s men’s and women’s apparel and accessories in China pursuant to a long-term license agreement with a joint venture of which we are a 49% owner. Further, we license the DKNY brand in North America for the following product categories: men’s sportswear, men’s dress shirts, men’s neckwear, men’s underwear, men’s loungewear, small leather goods, women’s belts and cold weather accessories and the DKNY and Donna Karan brands in North America for socks. Most recently, we licensed DKNY men’s underwear, men’s loungewear, men’s swimwear and men’s socks in Europe, the UK and Russia. We intend to continue to focus on expanding licensing opportunities for the DKNY and Donna Karan brands. We believe that we can capitalize on significant, untapped global licensing potential for these brands in a number of categories and we intend to grow royalty streams by expanding existing licenses, as well as through new categories with new licensees.
     We currently license the G.H. Bass brand for the wholesale distribution of men’s, women’s and children’s footwear, boy’s tailored clothing, men’s sportswear, men’s socks and women’s hosiery, and men’s accessories and small leather goods and home furnishings.
     We currently license the Vilebrequin brand internationally for a denim line.
     We currently license the Andrew Marc brand in North America for men’s and boy’s tailored clothing.

 Retail Operations
     We are a national retailer of outerwear, apparel, footwear and accessories in the United States. As of January 31, 2019, our retail operations segment consisted of 308 leased retail stores, of which 139 are stores operated under our Wilsons Leather name, 111 are stores operated under our G.H. Bass brand, 42 stores are operated under our DKNY brand, 11 stores are operated under the licensed Karl Lagerfeld Paris brand and 5 stores are operated under the licensed Calvin Klein Performance brand. Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass, DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris each operates its own online store.
     Substantially all of our Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and DKNY stores are operated as outlet stores and located in larger outlet centers. Wilsons Leather stores average approximately 3,690 square feet, G.H. Bass stores average approximately 5,900 square feet and DKNY stores average approximately 3,740 square feet. Given the current retail environment, we are focusing on significantly reducing our losses in our retail business with the goal of attaining profitability by allowing leases to expire as they come up for renewal if we are unable to satisfactorily renegotiate the terms of those leases. We also hired a new President of our retail business who is an industry veteran with a proven track record at leading retailers. In addition, we continue to evaluate our operating expenses, revise our merchandising strategy and repurpose certain Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass stores for the Karl Lagerfeld Paris or DKNY brands. We intend to continue our program of store count reduction and of increasing the efficiency and productivity of our retail operations.
     At January 31, 2018, we operated 367 retail stores across our Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass, DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld Paris and Calvin Klein Performance brands. At January 31, 2019, the store count for these brands had decreased to 308 locations. We expect to further reduce our store count and anticipate closing an additional approximately 40 to 45 stores by the end of fiscal 2020.
     Our Wilsons Leather retail stores primarily sell men’s and women’s outerwear and accessories. Outerwear sold in our Wilsons Leather stores includes both products sold to the retail operations segment by G-III’s wholesale operations segment, as well as products sourced by the retail operations segment. Accessories are purchased from third parties. All of our G.H. Bass outlet stores offer G.H. Bass casual and dress shoes for men and women and most of our G.H. Bass stores also carry G.H. Bass apparel for men and women, including tops, bottoms and outerwear, as well as accessories such as handbags, wallets, belts and travel gear. Our DKNY stores offer a large range of products including sportswear, dresses, suit separates, outerwear, handbags, footwear, intimates, sleepwear, hosiery, watches and eyewear. Merchandise is shipped from our main Brooklyn Park, Minnesota distribution center, as well as four regional distribution centers, to replenish stores as needed with key styles and to build inventory for the peak holiday selling season.
     We sell our products over the web through retail partners such as macys.com and nordstrom.com, each of which has a substantial online business. As e-commerce sales of apparel continue to increase, we are developing additional digital marketing initiatives on our web sites and through social media. We are investing in digital personnel, marketing, logistics, planning and distribution to help us expand our online opportunities. Our e-commerce business consists of our own web platforms at www.dkny.com, www.donnakaran.com, www.wilsonsleather.com, www.ghbass.com, www.vilebrequin.com and www.andrewmarc.com. We also sell our Karl Lagerfeld Paris products on our website, www.karllagerfeldparis.com. In addition, we sell to pure play online retail partners such as Amazon and Fanatics. 
     Products — Development and Design
     G-III designs, sources and markets women’s and men’s apparel at a wide range of retail price points. Our product offerings primarily include outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women’s suits and women’s performance wear. We also market footwear and accessories including women’s handbags, small leather goods, cold weather accessories, and luggage.
     G-III’s licensed apparel consists of both women’s and men’s products in a broad range of categories. See “Wholesale Operations — Licensed Products” above. Our strategy is to seek licenses that will enable us to offer a range of products targeting different price points and different distribution channels. We also offer a wide range of products under our own proprietary brands.
     We work with a diversified group of retail chains, such as Costco, Ross Stores and Nordstrom in developing product lines that are sold under their private label programs. Our design teams collaborate with our customers to produce custom-made products for department and specialty chain stores. Store buyers may provide samples to us or may select styles already available in our showrooms. We believe we have established a reputation among these buyers for our ability to produce high quality product on a reliable, expeditious and cost-effective basis.

 Our in-house designers are responsible for the design and look of our licensed, proprietary and private label products. We work closely with our licensors to create designs and styles for each of our licensed brands. Licensors generally must approve products to be sold under their brand names prior to production. We maintain a global pulse on styles, using trend services and color services to enable us to quickly respond to style changes in the apparel industry. Our experienced design personnel and our focused use of outside services enable us to incorporate current trends and consumer preferences in designing new products and styles.
     Our design personnel meet regularly with our sales and merchandising departments, as well as with the design and merchandising staffs of our licensors, to review market trends, sales results and the popularity of our latest products. In addition, our representatives regularly attend trade and fashion shows and shop at fashion forward stores in the United States, Europe and the Far East for inspiration. Our designers present sample items along with their evaluation of the styles expected to be in demand in the United States. We also seek input from selected customers with respect to product design. We believe that our sensitivity to the needs of retailers, coupled with the flexibility of our production capabilities and our continual monitoring of the retail market, enables us to modify designs and order specifications in a timely fashion.
     Manufacturing and Sourcing
     G-III wholesale operations and retail operations segments arrange for the production of products from independent manufacturers located primarily in China and, to a lesser extent, in Vietnam, Indonesia, Jordan, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Cambodia, and Central and South America. Vilebrequin’s products are manufactured primarily in Bulgaria, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, China, and Italy. A small portion of our garments are manufactured in the United States. We continue to make efforts to diversify production away from China and implement strategies to further diversify our production base.
     We currently have representative offices in Hangzhou, Nanjing, Qingdao and Dongguan, China, as well as in Vietnam and Indonesia. These offices act as our liaison with manufacturers in the Far East. G-III’s headquarters provides these liaison offices with production orders stating the quantity, quality, delivery time and types of garments to be produced. The personnel in our liaison offices assist in the negotiation and placement of orders with manufacturers. In allocating production among independent suppliers, we consider a number of criteria, including, but not limited to, quality, availability of production capacity, pricing and ability to meet changing production requirements.
     To facilitate better service for our customers and accommodate the volume of manufacturing in the Far East, we also have a subsidiary in Hong Kong. Our Hong Kong subsidiary supports third party production of products on an agency fee basis and acts as an agent for substantially all of our production. Our China and Hong Kong offices monitor production at manufacturers’ facilities to ensure quality control, compliance with our specifications and timely delivery of finished garments to our distribution facilities and, in some cases, direct to our customers. 
     In connection with the foreign manufacture of our products, manufacturers purchase raw materials including fabric, wool, leather and other submaterials (such as linings, zippers, buttons and trim) at our direction. Prior to commencing the manufacture of products, samples of raw materials or submaterials are sent to us for approval. We regularly inspect and supervise the manufacture of our products in order to ensure timely delivery, maintain quality control and monitor compliance with our manufacturing specifications. We also inspect finished products at the factory site.
     We generally arrange for the production of products on a purchase order basis with completed products manufactured to our design specifications. We assume the risk of loss predominantly on a Freight-On-Board (F.O.B.) basis when goods are delivered to a shipper and are insured against casualty losses arising during shipping.
     As is customary, we have not entered into any long-term contractual arrangements with any contractor or manufacturer. We believe that the production capacity of foreign manufacturers with which we have developed, or are developing, a relationship is adequate to meet our production requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that alternative foreign manufacturers are readily available.
     A majority of all finished goods manufactured for us is shipped to our distribution facilities or to designated third party facilities for final inspection, allocation, and reshipment to customers. The goods are delivered to our customers and us by independent shippers. We choose the form of shipment (principally ship, truck or air) based upon a customer’s needs, cost and timing considerations.

 Corporate Social Responsibility
     Our business has been built on family values and the belief that with hard work, conviction and a commitment to the greater good we could redefine what is possible. While we have always worked to create value for our stakeholders, we also seek to be a positive force in making our industry and our communities better. Our goals are simple: to Engage Our People, Protect Our Environment, and Invest in Our Communities.
· | Engage Our People - With more than 9,000 employees across the globe, G-III’s greatest asset is our people. We have worked hard to create an environment of inclusion and diversity globally that extends to our employees as well as those who work in our contracted factories. As of January 31, 2019, approximately 55 percent of our top management positions are held by women. We collaboratively work with our license partners and various social compliance organizations to advocate for greater accountability and transparency in our supply chain and support worker well-being programs in our contracted factories. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Protect Our Environment - We are seeking to reduce our impact on the environment by focusing on sustainability initiatives in our operations and throughout our supply chain. We are commencing several programs to reduce our consumption of energy, paper and plastics.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Invest in Our Communities – The importance of community is woven into our DNA. Our philanthropic efforts span a range of causes, including health and wellness, education and development, and corporate citizenship. We also work with a number of organizations that provide financial assistance, housing, clothing and employment counseling to underserved women and families. We donate to numerous nonprofit organizations and our employees provide many hours of volunteer support.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We are committed to embedding these principles into our business and better engaging our employees and those who work in our contracted factories, protecting our environment and supporting our communities while accepting our responsibility to be a good corporate citizen.
     Customs and Import Restrictions
     Our arrangements with textile manufacturers and suppliers are subject to requisite customs clearances for textile apparel and the imposition of export duties. United States Customs duties on our textile apparel presently range from duty free to 32%, depending upon the type of fabric used, how the garment is constructed and the country of export. A substantial majority of our product is imported into the United States and, to a lesser extent, into Canada and Europe. Countries in which our products are sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges or other import controls or restrictions or adjust prevailing duty or tariff levels, as well as quota restrictions. Any action by the executive branch of the United States government to increase tariffs on imported goods, such as the tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum and the imposition of tariffs on goods imported from China, could adversely affect our business. Under the provisions of the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) agreement governing international trade in textiles, known as the “WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing,” the United States and other WTO member countries have eliminated quotas on textiles and apparel-related products from WTO member countries. As a result, quota restrictions generally do not affect our business in most countries.
     Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to regulations that relate to product labeling, content and safety requirements, licensing requirements and flammability testing. We believe that we are in compliance with those regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment.
     Raw Materials
     We purchase substantially all of the products manufactured for us on a finished goods basis. We coordinate the sourcing of raw materials used in the production of our products, which are generally available from numerous sources. The apparel industry competes with manufacturers of many other products for the supply of raw materials.

 Marketing and Distribution
     G-III’s products are sold primarily to department, specialty and mass merchant retail stores in the United States. We sell to approximately 2,000 customers, ranging from national and regional chains to small specialty stores. We also distribute our products through our retail stores and, to a lesser extent, through our DKNY, Donna Karan, Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass, Vilebrequin and Andrew Marc websites, the Karl Lagerfeld Paris website, and the websites of our retail partners such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, Amazon and Fanatics.
     Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 69.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to 63.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 and 64.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2017. Sales to Macy’s, which includes sales to its Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s store chains, as well as through macys.com, accounted for an aggregate of 24.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to 22.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 and 21.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2017. In addition, sales to TJX Companies accounted for an aggregate of 12.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2019. The loss of either of these customers or a significant reduction in purchases by our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
     A substantial majority of our sales are made in the United States. We also market our products in Canada, Central America, South America, Europe, the Middle East and the Far East, which, on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 13.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to 12.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2018. 
     Our products are sold primarily through our direct sales force along with our principal executives who are also actively involved in the sale of our products. Some of our products are also sold by independent sales representatives located throughout the United States. The Canadian market is serviced by a sales and customer service team based both in the United States and in Canada. Vilebrequin products are sold through a direct sales force primarily located across Europe. Sales outside of the United States and Canada may be managed by our salespeople located in our sales offices in Europe or Asia depending on the customer.
     Brand name products sold by us pursuant to a license agreement are promoted by institutional and product advertisements placed by the licensor. Our license agreements generally require us to pay the licensor a fee, based on a percentage of net sales of licensed product, to pay for a portion of these advertising costs. We may also be required to spend a specified percentage of net sales of a licensed product on advertising placed by us.
     Our marketing and press efforts on behalf of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands are highly focused around communicating brand DNA and visual identity for the new evolution of DKNY and Donna Karan. We are re-building the brand image through high impact ad campaigns that feature socially relevant talent. We are striving to create noteworthy marketing initiatives, collaborations and image programs to build brand awareness and bring in a new young customer. Donna Karan and DKNY will continue to support global licensees with brand campaigns and product images to tell the brand story. We expect to invest in digital media and storytelling for brand amplification and to establish comprehensive commercial marketing tools that will support our global wholesale and retail channels.
     Marketing efforts by Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass are primarily focused on increasing store traffic and then converting customers to buyers. This goal is mainly accomplished through our customer relations programs, local advertising and mall marketing promotions along with marketing initiatives through the Internet, social media and public relations support. We continue to revitalize and build the G.H. Bass heritage brand through products featuring new design and comfort technology, improved assortments and additional category licenses.
     Vilebrequin’s marketing efforts have been based on continually offering new swimwear prints and expanding the range of its products to new categories such as women’s swimwear, ready-to-wear and accessories. Besides its traditional advertising networks (print and outdoor advertising), Vilebrequin is seeking to develop new marketing channels through the use of digital media, product placement and public relations. Through the growth of its network of stores, distributors and franchisees, Vilebrequin is seeking to reinforce its position in its traditional markets, such as the United States, Europe and the Middle East, and to develop new markets in Asia.
     We advertise our Andrew Marc and Marc New York brands and are engaged in both cooperative advertising programs with retailers and direct to the consumer. Our marketing strategy is focused on media, public relations and channel marketing. Our media strategy for Andrew Marc includes traditional print, such as catalogs, and outdoor advertising, as well as digital and social media initiatives.

 We believe we have developed awareness of our other owned labels primarily through our reputation, consumer acceptance and the fashion press. We primarily rely on our reputation and relationships to generate business in the private label portion of our wholesale operations segment. We believe we have developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry as a result of, among other things, our standards of quality control, on-time delivery, competitive pricing and willingness and ability to assist customers in their merchandising of our products.
     As e-commerce sales of apparel continue to increase, we are developing initiatives to increase our digital presence through our own web sites and through the websites of our retail partners. We are working closely with our retail partners to provide consumers with a high quality viewing experience for our products. We are also working to increase our e-commerce sales through marketing, social influencers and other online drivers of sales.
     Seasonality
     Retail sales of apparel have traditionally been seasonal in nature. Historically, our wholesale business has been dependent on our sales during our third and fourth quarter. Net sales during the third and fourth quarter accounted for approximately 61% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 62% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 and 54% of our net sales in fiscal 2017. We are highly dependent on our results of operations during the second half of our fiscal year. The second half of the year is expected to continue to provide a larger amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our net income for the foreseeable future.     Order Book
     A portion of our orders consists of short-term purchase orders from customers who place orders on an as-needed basis. Information relative to open purchase orders at any date may also be materially affected by, among other things, the timing of the initial showing of apparel to the trade, as well as by the timing of recording of orders and shipments. As a result, we do not believe that disclosure of the amount of our unfilled customer orders at any time is meaningful.     Competition
     We have numerous competitors with respect to the sale of our products, including brand owners, distributors that import products from abroad, and domestic retailers with established foreign manufacturing capabilities. Some of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources and greater manufacturing capacity than we do. Our retail business competes against a diverse group of retailers, including, among others, other outlet stores, department stores, specialty stores, warehouse clubs and e-commerce retailers. Sales of our products are affected by style, price, quality, brand reputation and general fashion trends.     Trademarks
     We own some of the trademarks used by us in connection with our wholesale operations segment, as well as almost all of the trademarks used in our retail operations segment. We act as licensee of certain trademarks owned by third parties that are used in connection with our business. The principal brands that we license are summarized under the heading “Wholesale Operations – Licensed Products” above. We also use the licensed Calvin Klein and Karl Lagerfeld Paris brands in our retail operations segment. We own a number of proprietary brands that we use in connection with our business and products including, among others, DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Eliza J, Jessica Howard and G-III Sports by Carl Banks. We have registered, or applied for registration of, many of our trademarks in multiple jurisdictions for use on a variety of apparel and related other products.
     In markets outside of the United States, our rights to some of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our attempt to expand into foreign markets, we may experience conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks that would impede our use and registration of some of our trademarks. Such conflicts may arise from time to time as we pursue international expansion. Although we have not in the past suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets or in new product categories, we cannot be sure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional brands to new markets.

 We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that they have value in the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights against infringement.
     Employees
     As of January 31, 2019, we employed approximately 4,100 employees on a full-time basis and approximately 3,300 employees on a part-time basis. During our peak retail selling season from October through January, we employed approximately 2,400 additional seasonal associates in our retail stores. We employ both union and non-union personnel and believe that our relations with our employees are good. We have not experienced any interruption of our operations due to a labor disagreement with our employees.
     G-III is a party to an agreement with a labor union. As of January 31, 2019, this agreement covers approximately 440 of our full-time employees, most of whom work in our warehouses located in New Jersey, and is currently in effect through November 15, 2020. As successor to the Donna Karan Company LLC (“DKC”), G-III is also subject to DKC’s agreement with the same union. The Donna Karan agreement covers approximately 26 full time employees, most of whom work in their warehouse in New Jersey. This agreement is currently in effect through May 31, 2019.
     As successor to DKC, G-III is also subject to DKC’s agreement with another labor union. As of January 31, 2019, this agreement covers approximately 3 of our full-time employees, who work as tailors and sample makers in our New York offices. The agreement is currently in effect through May 31, 2019.
