Item 1. Business
General

Chemed Corporation (the “Company” or “Chemed”) was incorporated in Delaware in 1970 as a subsidiary of W.R. Grace & Co. and succeeded to the business of W.R. Grace & Co.’s Special Products Group as of April 30, 1971 and remained a subsidiary of W.R. Grace & Co. until March 10, 1982.

Chemed purchases, operates and divests subsidiaries engaged in diverse business activities for the purposes of maximizing shareholder value. The Company’s day to day operating businesses are managed on a decentralized basis. There are few integrated business functions between the operating units and Chemed (such as sales, marketing or purchasing). Chemed’s corporate office management participates in and is ultimately responsible for long term strategic planning, significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities, financial reporting, tax, legal and the selection of the key executives of each of the operating businesses. Since its inception, the Company has engaged in twelve significant acquisitions or divestitures of diverse business units.

During 2022, Chemed conducted its business operations in two segments: the VITAS segment (“VITAS”) and the Roto-Rooter segment (“Roto-Rooter”). VITAS provides hospice and palliative care services to its patients through a network of physicians, registered nurses, home health aides, social workers, clergy and volunteers. Roto-Rooter provides plumbing, drain cleaning, excavation, water restoration and other related services to residential and commercial customers.

Forward Looking Statements

This Annual Report contains or incorporates by reference certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company intends such statements to be subject to the safe harbors created by that legislation. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Financial Information about Industry Segments

The required segment and geographic data for the Company’s continuing operations (as described below) for three years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 are shown in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 60-61 of the 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders and are incorporated herein by reference.

Description of Business by Segment

The information called for by this item is included within Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 60-61 of the 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated herein by reference.

Product and Market Development

Each segment of the Company’s business analyzes opportunities for the development and marketing of new services and products. While new products and services and new market development are important factors for the long term growth of each active segment of the Company’s business, the Company does not expect that any new products and services or marketing effort, including those in the development stage, will require the investment of a material amount of the Company’s assets.
Patents, Service Marks and Licenses

The Roto-Rooter trademarks and service marks have been used and advertised since 1935 by Roto-Rooter Corporation, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company. The Roto-Rooter marks are among the most highly recognized trademarks and service marks in the United States. The Company considers the Roto-Rooter marks to be a valuable asset and a significant factor in the marketing of Roto-Rooter’s franchises, products and services and the products and services provided by its franchises.

“VITAS” and “Innovative Hospice Care” are trademarks and servicemarks of VITAS Healthcare Corporation. The Company and its subsidiaries also own certain trade secrets including training manuals, cost information, patient information and software source code. Certain states require certificates of need to conduct hospice operations. In those states, we consider certificates of need valuable assets.

 

Seasonality

Roto-Rooter’s revenue and operating results are impacted by significant weather patterns across the United States. Significant changes in precipitation or temperatures in areas we have company-owned and Independent Contractor operations will generally affect the revenue and operating results at Roto-Rooter.

A significant portion of our VITAS business is operated in the state of Florida. The vast majority of our patients are Medicare recipients. Medicare patients relocating to Florida during the winter months generally result in higher admissions and revenue for our Florida programs during that period.

Customer Concentration

Roto-Rooter’s business has a large and diverse customer base. Over 90% of VITAS’ revenue is from the United States government through the Medicare program. The loss of a portion or all of our Medicare revenue would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Competition
Roto-Rooter

All aspects of the sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, plumbing repair, excavation and water restoration businesses are highly competitive. Competition is fragmented in most markets with local and regional firms providing the primary competition. The principal methods of competition are advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, emergency-service availability, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees, and pricing.
VITAS

Hospice care in the United States is competitive. Plans of care for hospice services are not proprietary. As a result, VITAS competes and differentiates itself primarily on the basis of its ability to deliver quality, responsive services within the requirements of Medicare’s hospice conditions of participation. VITAS is one of the nation’s largest providers of hospice services in an industry dominated primarily by small, community-based hospices. Approximately one quarter of all hospice providers are not-for-profit. Because the hospice care industry is highly fragmented, VITAS competes with a large number of organizations.

VITAS also competes with a number of national and regional hospice providers, hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies and other health care providers. Many providers offer home care to patients who are terminally ill, and some actively market palliative care and hospice-like programs. In addition, various health care companies have diversified into the hospice market. Some of these health care companies have greater financial resources than VITAS. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in many of the markets served by VITAS. Accordingly, other companies that are not currently providing hospice care may enter these markets and expand the variety of services they offer to include hospice.

Research and Development

The Company continuously works to develop new services, products and processes, improve existing services, products and processes, and develop new and different uses of existing products. The research and development expenditures from continuing operations have not been nor are they expected to be material.
Government Regulations
Roto-Rooter

Roto-Rooter’s franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regarding the offering or sale of franchises. The rules and regulations of the FTC require that Roto-Rooter provide all the prospective franchises with specific information regarding the franchise program and Roto-Rooter in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular. In addition, a number of states require Roto-Rooter to register its franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in the state. Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws, and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration. Roto-Rooter’s ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by state and local licensing laws and regulations. 

VITAS

General. The health care industry and VITAS’ hospice programs are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. VITAS’ hospices are licensed as required under state law as either hospices or home health agencies, or both, depending on the regulatory requirements of each particular state. In addition, VITAS’ hospices are required to meet certain conditions of participation to be eligible to receive payments as hospices under Medicare and Medicaid programs. All of VITAS’ hospices, other than those currently in development, are certified for participation as hospices in the Medicare program, and are also eligible to receive payments as hospices from the Medicaid program in each of the states in which VITAS operates. VITAS’ hospices are subject to periodic survey by governmental authorities or private accrediting entities to assure compliance with state licensing, certification and accreditation requirements.

Medicare Conditions of Participation. Federal regulations require that a hospice program satisfy certain Conditions of Participation (“COP”) to be certified and receive Medicare payment for the services it provides. Failure to comply with the conditions of participation may result in sanctions, up to and including decertification from the Medicare program. See “Surveys and Audits” below.

The Medicare COP for hospice programs include the following:

Governing Body. Each hospice must have a governing body that assumes full responsibility for the policies and the overall operation of the hospice and for ensuring that all services are provided in a manner consistent with accepted standards of practice. The governing body must designate one individual who is responsible for the day-to-day management of the hospice.

Medical Director. Each hospice must have a medical director who is a physician and who assumes responsibility for overseeing the medical component of the hospice’s patient care program.

Direct Provision of Core Services. Medicare limits those services for which the hospice may use individual independent contractors or contract agencies to provide care to patients. Specifically, substantially all nursing, social work, and counseling services must be provided directly by hospice employees meeting specific educational and professional standards. During periods of peak patient loads or under extraordinary circumstances, the hospice may be permitted to use contract workers, but the hospice must agree in writing to maintain professional, financial and administrative responsibility for the services provided by those individuals or entities.

Professional Management of Non-Core Services. A hospice may arrange to have non-core services such as therapy services, home health aide services, medical supplies or drugs provided by a non-employee or outside entity. If the hospice elects to use an independent contractor to provide non-core services, however, the hospice must retain professional management responsibility for the arranged services and ensure that the services are furnished in a safe and effective manner by qualified personnel, and in accordance with the patient’s plan of care.

Plan of Care. The patient’s attending physician, the medical director or the designated hospice physician, and interdisciplinary team must establish an individualized written plan of care prior to providing care to any hospice patient. The plan must assess the patient’s needs and identify services to be provided to meet those needs and must be reviewed and updated at specified intervals.

Continuation of Care. A hospice may not discontinue or reduce care provided to a Medicare beneficiary if the individual becomes unable to pay for that care.

Informed Consent. The hospice must obtain the informed consent of the hospice patient, or the patient’s legal representative, that specifies the type of care services that may be provided as hospice care, which is palliative and not curative care. The patient or the patient’s legal representative must also acknowledge that by choosing hospice care, certain other Medicare benefits are waived.

Training. A hospice must provide ongoing training for its employees.

Quality Assurance. A hospice must conduct ongoing and comprehensive self-assessments of the quality and appropriateness of care it provides and that its contractors provide under arrangements to hospice patients. 

Interdisciplinary Team. A hospice must designate an interdisciplinary team to provide or supervise hospice care services. The interdisciplinary team develops and updates plans of care, and establishes policies governing the day-to-day provision of hospice services. The team must include at least a physician, registered nurse, social worker and spiritual or other counselor. A registered nurse must be designated to coordinate the plan of care.



Volunteers. Hospice programs are required to recruit and train volunteers to provide patient care services or administrative services. Volunteer services must be provided in an amount equal to at least five percent of the total patient care hours provided by all paid hospice employees and contract staff.

Licensure. Each hospice and all hospice personnel must be licensed, certified or registered in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.

Central Clinical Records. Hospice programs must maintain clinical records for each hospice patient that are organized in such a way that they may be easily retrieved. The clinical records must be complete and accurate and protected against loss, destruction and unauthorized use.

Surveys and Audits. Hospice programs are subject to periodic survey by federal and state regulatory authorities and private accrediting entities to ensure compliance with applicable licensing and certification requirements and accreditation standards. In 2021, CMS added a vaccination requirement (with certain exceptions) to these standards for staff working at all CMS certified facilities, which will be subject to any audit. Regulators conduct periodic surveys of hospice programs and provide reports containing statements of deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with various regulatory requirements. Survey reports and statements of deficiencies are common in the healthcare industry. In most cases, the hospice program and regulatory authorities will agree upon any steps to be taken to bring the hospice into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In some cases, however, a state or federal regulatory authority may take a number of adverse actions against a hospice program, including the imposition of fines, civil monetary penalties, payment suspensions, insertion of temporary management, temporary suspension of admission of new patients to the hospice’s service, implementing directed plans of correction or, in extreme circumstances, decertification from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or revocation of the hospice’s license.

CMS has recently started implementing a Targeted Probe and Educate (“TPE”) program, designed to improve compliance in submitting Medicare claims and reduce deficiencies. In the TPE program, a healthcare provider has up to three rounds of review to sufficiently improve results, or the provider may face significant action from CMS. During the rounds of a TPE review, payment of claims subject to the review is delayed. 

From time to time VITAS receives survey reports containing statements of deficiencies and sustains related adverse actions. VITAS reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action, including where appropriate, appealing the reports and any adverse actions discussed in the reports. VITAS believes that its hospices are in material compliance with applicable licensure and certification requirements. If a VITAS hospice were found to be out of compliance and actions were taken against a VITAS hospice, they could materially adversely affect the hospice’s ability to continue to operate, to provide certain services and to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could materially adversely affect VITAS.

Billing Audits/Claims Reviews. The Medicare program and its Medicare Administrative Contractors and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospice claims. There is pressure from state and federal governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness. In order to conduct these reviews, the payor requests documentation from VITAS and then reviews that documentation to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the eligibility of patients to receive hospice benefits, the appropriateness of the care provided to those patients and the documentation of that care. VITAS’ claims are periodically subject to review and audit. We make appropriate provisions in our accounting records to reduce our revenue for anticipated denial or delay of payment related to these audits and reviews. We believe our hospice programs comply with all payor requirements at the time of billing. However, we cannot predict whether future billing reviews or similar audits by payors will result in material delays, suspensions, denials or reductions in revenue.

Corporate Integrity Agreement. VITAS and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) on October 30, 2017 in connection with the settlement of a False Claims Act case. The CIA formalizes various aspects of VITAS’ already existing Compliance Program and contains requirements designed to document ongoing compliance with federal healthcare program requirements. It has a term of five years during which it imposes monitoring, reporting, certification, oversight, screening and training obligations, certain of which had previously been implemented by VITAS. Although the term of the CIA has lapsed, VITAS has certain obligations remaining under the CIA including, engaging an Independent Review Organization to perform auditing and review functions and to prepare reports regarding compliance with federal healthcare programs for the last year of the term of the CIA. In the event of breach of the CIA, VITAS could become liable for payment of stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. 

Certificate of Need Laws and Other Restrictions. Some states, including Florida and California, have certificate of need laws, restrictions on new licenses, or other similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers. These states may require some form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding or expanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under other specified circumstances. Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally 

 
conditioned on the showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community. VITAS may seek to develop, acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws. To the extent that state agencies require VITAS to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expand services at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new or existing geographic markets, VITAS’ plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain such certificate or approval. In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency. Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, could adversely affect VITAS. In the event that these restrictions are removed or their impact is lessened in any geography in which VITAS already operates, additional competitors may more easily be able to enter those markets, and potentially adversely affect VITAS.

 Limitations on For-Profit Ownership. A few states have laws that restrict the development and expansion of for-profit hospice programs. For example, in New York, a hospice generally cannot be owned by a corporation that has another corporation as a stockholder. These types of restrictions could affect VITAS’ ability to expand into New York, or in other jurisdictions with similar restrictions.

Limits on Acquisitions or Conversions. A number of states have enacted laws that restrict the ability of for-profit entities to acquire or otherwise assume the operations of a non-profit health care provider. Some states may require government review, public hearings, and/or government approval of transactions in which a for-profit entity proposes to purchase certain non-profit healthcare organizations. Heightened scrutiny of these transactions may significantly increase the costs associated with future acquisitions of non-profit hospice programs in some states, otherwise increase the difficulty in completing those acquisitions or prevent them entirely. Additionally, sizable healthcare transaction have recently received heighten scrutiny from antitrust regulators with respect to both horizontal and vertical mergers, which may affect VITAS’ prospects for acquisition. VITAS cannot assure that it will not encounter regulatory or governmental obstacles in connection with any proposed acquisition of non-profit hospice programs in the future.

Professional Licensure and Participation Agreements. Many hospice employees are subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing the ethics and practice of their profession, including physicians, physical, speech and occupational therapists, social workers, home health aides, pharmacists and nurses. In addition, those professionals who are eligible to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs as individuals must not have been excluded from participation in those programs at any time.

State Licensure of Hospice. Each of VITAS’ hospices must be licensed in the state in which it operates. State licensure rules and regulations require that VITAS’ hospices maintain certain standards and meet certain requirements, which may vary from state to state. VITAS believes that its hospices are in material compliance with applicable licensure requirements. If a VITAS hospice were found to be out of compliance and actions were taken against a VITAS hospice, they could materially adversely affect the hospice’s ability to continue to operate, to provide certain services and to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could materially adversely affect VITAS.

Overview of Government Payments—General. Over 95% of VITAS’ revenue consisted of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis. Under the per diem reimbursement methodology, VITAS is essentially at risk for the cost of eligible services provided to hospice patients. Profitability is therefore largely dependent upon VITAS’ ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients. Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation and other increases, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business in the future. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are increasing pressure to control health care costs and to decrease or limit increases in reimbursement rates for health care services. As with most government programs, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, possible retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business. VITAS’ levels of revenues and profitability are subject to the effect of legislative and regulatory changes, including possible reductions in coverage or payment rates, increased scrutiny of claims necessitating additional resources to respond, or changes in methods of payment, by the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Overview of Government Payments – Medicare 

Medicare Eligibility Criteria. To receive Medicare payment for hospice services, the hospice medical director and, if the patient has one, the patient’s attending physician, must certify and describe in a brief narrative that the patient has a life expectancy of six months or less if the illness runs its normal course. This determination is made based on the physician’s clinical judgment. Due to the uncertainty of such prognoses, however, it is likely and expected that some percentage of hospice patients will not die within six months of entering a hospice program. The Medicare program (among other third-party payers) recognizes that terminal illnesses often do not follow an entirely predictable course, and therefore the hospice benefit remains available to beneficiaries so long as the hospice physician or the patient’s attending physician continues to certify that the patient’s life expectancy remains six months or less and the patient or patient’s legal representative, continues to maintain the hospice election. Specifically, the Medicare hospice benefit provides for two initial 90 day benefit periods followed by an unlimited number of 60 day periods. In order to qualify for hospice care, a Medicare 

 
beneficiary must elect hospice care and waive any right to other Medicare benefits related to his or her terminal illness. A Medicare beneficiary may revoke his or her election of the Medicare hospice benefit at any time and resume receiving regular Medicare benefits. The patient may elect the hospice benefit again at a later date so long as he or she remains eligible. The Medicare program, however, has reaffirmed that Medicare hospice beneficiaries are not limited to six months of coverage and that there is no limit on how long a Medicare beneficiary can continue to receive hospice benefits and services, provided that the beneficiary continues to meet the eligibility criteria under the Medicare hospice program.

Levels of Care. Medicare pays for hospice services on a prospective payment system basis under which VITAS receives an established payment rate for each day that it provides hospice services to a Medicare beneficiary. These rates are subject to annual adjustments for inflation and vary based upon the geographic location where the services are provided. The rate VITAS receives depends on which level of care is being provided to the beneficiary.

There are four levels of care and related reimbursement within the Medicare Hospice Benefit. These levels of care are Routine Home Care, Continuous Care, Inpatient Care and Respite Care. Medicare hospice providers are required under Medicare’s Conditions of Participation and their regulations to provide all four levels of care, available on a 24/7 basis, when appropriate.

VITAS, as required under Medicare’s Conditions of Participation and their regulations, has the ability to provide all levels of care to its patients. The actual level of care a patient receives on any given day is based upon the clinical needs of the patient. 

Routine Home Care. The routine home care rate is paid for each day that a patient is in a hospice program and is not receiving one of the other categories of hospice care. The routine home care rate is a two tiered rate, with a higher rate for the first 60 days of a hospice patient’s care and a lower rate for days 61 and after. In addition, there is a Service Intensity Add-on payment which covers direct home care visits conducted by a registered nurse or social worker in the last seven days of a hospice patient’s life, reimbursed up to 4 hours per day in 15 minute increments at the continuous care rate.

General Inpatient Care. The general inpatient care rate is paid when a patient requires inpatient services for a short period for pain control or symptom management which cannot be managed in other settings. General inpatient care services must be provided in a Medicare or Medicaid certified hospital or long-term care facility or at a freestanding inpatient hospice facility with the required registered nurse staffing.

Continuous Home Care. Continuous home care, which VITAS refers to as “Intensive Comfort Care,” is provided to patients while at home, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms. Continuous home care requires a minimum of 8 hours of care within a 24 hour day, which begins and ends at midnight. The care must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse. While the published Medicare continuous home care rates are daily rates, Medicare actually pays for continuous home care in 15 minute increments. This 15 minute rate is calculated by dividing the daily rate by 96.

Respite Care. Respite care permits a hospice patient to receive services on an inpatient basis for a short period of time in order to provide relief for the patient’s family or other caregivers from the demands of caring for the patient. A hospice can receive payment for respite care for a given patient for up to five consecutive days at a time, after which respite care is reimbursed at the routine home care rate. 

Medicare Payment for Physician Services. Payment for direct patient care physician services delivered by hospice physicians is billed separately by the hospice to the Medicare Administrative Contractors and paid at the lesser of the actual charge or the Medicare allowable charge for these services. This payment is in addition to the per diem rates VITAS receives for hospice care. Payment for hospice physicians’ administrative and general supervisory activities is included in the daily rates discussed above. Payments for attending physician professional services (other than services furnished by hospice physicians) are not paid to the hospice, but rather are paid directly to the attending physician by the Medicare Administrative Contractors. For fiscal 2022, less than 2% of VITAS’ net revenue was attributable to physician services.

Medicare Limits on Hospice Care Payments. Medicare payments for hospice services are subject to two additional limits or “caps”. Each of VITAS’ hospice programs is separately subject to both of these “caps”. Both of these “caps” are determined on an annual basis for the period running from October 1 through September 30 of each year.

First, under a Medicare rule known as the “80-20” rule applicable to the Medicare inpatient services, if the number of inpatient care days furnished by a hospice to Medicare beneficiaries exceeds 20% of the total days of hospice care furnished by such hospice to Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare payments to the hospice for inpatient care days exceeding the cap are reduced to the routine home care rate. 



Second, Medicare payments to a hospice are also subject to a separate cap based on overall average payments per admission. Any payments exceeding this overall hospice cap must be refunded by the hospice. This cap was set at $31,297.61 per admission for the twelve month period ended on September 30, 2022, increased to $32,486.92 for the twelve month period ending on September 30, 2023, and is adjusted annually to account for inflation. VITAS’ hospices may be subject to future payment reductions or recoupments as the result of this cap. 

Medicare Managed Care Programs. The Medicare program has entered into contracts with managed care companies to provide managed care benefits to Medicare beneficiaries who elect to participate in managed care programs. These managed care programs are commonly referred to as Medicare HMOs, Medicare Advantage or Medicare risk products. VITAS provides hospice care to Medicare beneficiaries who participate in these managed care programs, and VITAS is paid for services provided to these beneficiaries in the same way and at the same rates as those of other Medicare beneficiaries who are not in a Medicare managed care program. Under current Medicare policy, Medicare pays the hospice directly for services provided to these managed care program participants. 

Overview of Government Payments – Medicaid

Medicaid Coverage and Reimbursements. State Medicaid programs are another source of VITAS’ net patient revenue. Medicaid is a state-administered program financed by state funds and federal funds to provide medical assistance to the indigent and certain other eligible persons. For those states that elect to provide a hospice benefit, the Medicaid program is required to pay the hospice at rates at least equal to the rates provided under Medicare and calculated using the same methodology. States maintain flexibility to establish their own hospice election procedures and to limit the number and duration of benefit periods for which they will pay for hospice services. Reimbursement from state Medicaid programs in 2022 accounted for approximately 5% of VITAS’ revenues.

Nursing Home Residents. For VITAS’ patients who receive nursing home care under a state Medicaid program and who elect hospice care under Medicare or Medicaid, VITAS contracts with nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of room and board services. In addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice daily or hourly rate, the state generally must pay VITAS an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid daily nursing home rate for room and board services furnished to the patient by the nursing home. Under VITAS’ standard nursing home contracts, VITAS pays the nursing home for these room and board services at the Medicaid daily nursing home rate. 

Managed Medicaid. In some states in which VITAS operates, the state legislatures have established managed Medicaid programs. Managed Medicaid programs outsource the process of eligibility determination and payment by Medicaid to private insurance companies. In some states, participants are required to choose a managed Medicaid provider. VITAS negotiates participant eligibility and documentation requirements, as well as hospice pay rates with each managed Medicaid provider. These requirements and pay rates may or may not align with the applicable Medicare hospice regulations and pay rates.

Adjustments to Medicare and Medicaid Payment Rates.

Payment rates under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are adjusted annually for inflation based upon the Hospital Market Basket Index and the Consumer Price Index; however, the adjustments have historically been less than actual inflation. These base rates are further modified by the Hospice Wage Index to reflect local differences in wages according to the revised wage index. Effective April 1, 2013, the Federal government implemented a 2% reimbursement cut for all Medicare programs, including hospice. In response to COVID-19, this 2% reimbursement cut was suspended or reduced to 1% through a series of legislative measures for the period May 1, 2020 through June 30, 2022. It is possible that there will be further modifications to the rate structure under which the Medicare or Medicaid programs pay for hospice care services; the current cut is scheduled to last through the Federal Government’s fiscal year 2027. Any future reductions in the rate of increase or an actual decrease in Medicare and Medicaid payments may have an adverse impact on VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability. 

On August 6, 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released the fiscal year 2020 hospice wage index and payment rate update (FY 2020 update). The FY 2020 update includes the normal yearly inflationary increase by level of care plus a rebasing of the continuous care, inpatient care and respite care rates. The rebasing of these levels of care was to reflect non-inflationary changes in providers’ costs over time. The rebasing increased the national average reimbursement rate for continuous care by 39.9% and inpatient care by 34.7%. Respite care is not material to our operations. The rebasing of these levels of care was effective on October 1, 2019. On July 31, 2022, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released the 2023 inflationary increase effective October 1, 2022, which was 3.8%

Other Healthcare Regulations

Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws and Safe Harbor Provisions. The federal Anti-Kickback Law makes it a felony to knowingly and willingly offer, pay, solicit or receive any form of remuneration in exchange for referring, recommending, arranging, purchasing, leasing or ordering items or services covered by a federal health care program including Medicare or Medicaid. The Anti-

 
Kickback Law applies regardless of whether the remuneration is provided directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind. Although the Anti-Kickback statute does not prohibit all financial transactions or relationships that providers of healthcare items or services may have with each other, interpretations of the law have been very broad. Under current law, courts and federal regulatory authorities have stated that this law is violated if even one purpose (as opposed to the sole or primary purpose) of the arrangement is to induce referrals.

Violations of the Anti-Kickback Law carry potentially severe penalties including imprisonment of up to ten years, criminal fines of up to $100,000 per act, civil money penalties of up to $100,000 per act, and additional damages of up to three times the amounts claimed or remuneration offered or paid. Federal law also authorizes exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violations of the Anti-Kickback Law. 

The Anti-Kickback Law contains several statutory exceptions to the broad prohibition. In addition, Congress authorized the OIG to publish numerous “safe harbors” that exempt some practices from enforcement action under the Anti-Kickback Law and related laws. These statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protect various bona fide employment relationships, contracts for the rental of space or equipment, personal service arrangements, and management contracts, among other things, provided that certain conditions set forth in the statute or regulations are satisfied. The safe harbor regulations, however, do not comprehensively describe all lawful relationships between healthcare providers and referral sources, and the failure of an arrangement to satisfy all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement is unlawful. Failure to comply with the safe harbor provisions, however, may mean that the arrangement will be subject to scrutiny. 

Many states, including states where VITAS does business, have adopted similar prohibitions against payments that are intended to induce referrals of patients, regardless of the source of payment. Some of these state laws lack explicit “safe harbors” that may be available under federal law. Sanctions under these state anti-kickback laws may include civil money penalties, license suspension or revocation, exclusion from the Medicare or Medicaid programs, and criminal fines or imprisonment. Little precedent exists regarding the interpretation or enforcement of these statutes. 

VITAS is required under the Medicare conditions of participation and some state licensing laws to contract with numerous healthcare providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes, and to arrange for these individuals or entities to provide services to VITAS’ patients. In addition, VITAS has contracts with other suppliers, including pharmacies, ambulance services and medical equipment companies. Some of these individuals or entities may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to VITAS, and VITAS may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to these individuals or entities. These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor. VITAS from time to time seeks guidance from regulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicability of these anti-kickback laws to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deems appropriate. The Company generally believes that VITAS’ contracts and arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers do not violate applicable anti-kickback laws. However, the Company cannot assure that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with VITAS’ practices.

HIPAA Anti-Fraud Provisions. HIPAA includes several revisions to existing health care fraud laws by permitting the imposition of civil monetary penalties in cases involving violations of the anti-kickback statute or contracting with excluded providers. In addition, HIPAA created statutes making it a federal felony to engage in fraud, theft, embezzlement, or the making of false statements with respect to healthcare benefit programs, which include private, as well as government programs. In addition, federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from the Medicare and Medicaid programs any investors, officers and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed healthcare fraud, even if the investor, officer or employee had no actual knowledge of the fraud. 

OIG Fraud Alerts, Advisory Opinions and Other Program Guidance. The OIG identifies and seeks to eliminate fraud, abuse and waste in HHS programs. The OIG conducts audits, investigations and inspections and issues public pronouncements identifying practices that may be subject to heightened scrutiny. There have been a number of hospice related audits and reviews conducted. These reviews and recommendations have included: 

Ensuring that Medicare hospice eligibility determinations are made in accordance with the Medicare regulations; and

Revising the annual cap on hospice benefits to better reflect the cost of care provided.

Currently, VITAS is one of a group of hospice providers selected by the OIG’s Office of Audit Services (“OAS”) for inclusion in an audit of the provision of elevated level-of-care hospice services to a sample of patients. Please see Note 18 “Legal and Regulatory Matters” for a further description of the audit and claims that have risen from the audit. 

From time to time, various federal and state agencies, such as HHS and the OIG, issue a variety of pronouncements, including fraud alerts, the OIG’s Annual Work Plan and other reports, identifying practices that may be subject to heightened governmental 

 
scrutiny. The Company cannot predict what, if any, changes may be implemented in coverage, reimbursement, or enforcement policies as a result of these OIG reviews and recommendations.

On October 30, 2017, the Company entered into a settlement agreement to resolve civil litigation under the False Claims Act brought by the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) on behalf of the OIG and various relators concerning VITAS, filed in the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Missouri. The Company denied any violation of law and agreed to settlement without admission of wrongdoing.

In connection with the settlement, VITAS and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a corporate integrity agreement (“CIA”) on October 30, 2017. The CIA formalizes various aspects of VITAS’ already existing Compliance Program and contains requirements designed to document compliance with federal healthcare program requirements. It has a term of five years during which it imposes monitoring, reporting, certification, oversight, screening and training obligations, certain of which had previously been implemented by VITAS. It also requires VITAS to engage an Independent Review Organization (“IRO”) to perform audit and review functions and to prepare reports regarding compliance with federal healthcare programs. Although the term of the CIA has lapsed, VITAS has certain continued obligations under the agreement, including the IRO’s audit for the fifth year of the CIA. In the event of breach of the CIA, VITAS could become liable for payment of stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs.

Federal False Claims Acts. The federal law includes several criminal and civil false claims provisions, which provide that knowingly submitting claims for items or services that were not provided as represented may result in the imposition of multiple damages, administrative civil money penalties, criminal fines, imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in federally funded healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the OIG may impose extensive and costly corporate integrity requirements upon a healthcare provider that is the subject of a false claims judgment or settlement. These requirements may include the creation of a formal compliance program, the appointment of a government monitor, and the imposition of annual reporting requirements and audits conducted by an independent review organization to monitor compliance with the terms of the agreement and relevant laws and regulations. The Affordable Care Act also contains provisions aimed at strengthening fraud and abuse enforcement.

As described above, VITAS and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a CIA with the OIG on October 30, 2017 in connection with the prior settlement of a False Claims Act Case. 

The Civil False Claims Act prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payments. Penalties for violations include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 (as adjusted for inflation), plus treble damages, for each claim filed. Provisions in the Civil False Claims Act also permit individuals to bring actions against individuals or businesses in the name of the government as “qui tam” relators. If a qui tam relator’s claim is successful, he or she is entitled to share the government’s recovery.

Both direct enforcement activity by the government and qui tam actions have increased significantly and have increased the risk that a healthcare company may have to defend a false claims action, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs as a result of an investigation arising out of this type of an action. Because of the complexity of the government regulations applicable to the healthcare industry, the Company cannot assure that VITAS will not be the subject of other actions under the False Claims Act.

State False Claims Laws. Several states in which VITAS currently operates have adopted state false claims laws that mirror to some degree the federal false claims laws. While these statutes vary in scope and effect, the penalties for violating these false claims laws include administrative, civil and/or criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, and the imposition of multiple damages.

The Stark Law and State Physician Self-Referral Laws. Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the “Stark Law”, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest or with whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to a number of statutory and regulatory exceptions. Penalties for violating the Stark Law are severe and include:

Denial of payment;

Civil monetary penalties of $15,000 per referral or $100,000 for “circumvention schemes;” (each adjusted for inflation)

Assessments equal to 200% of the dollar value of each such service provided; and 

Exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Hospice care itself is not specifically listed as a designated health service; however, certain services that VITAS provides, or in the future may provide, are among the services identified as designated health services for purposes of the self-referral laws. The 

 
Company cannot assure that future regulatory changes will not result in hospice services becoming subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment or compensation prohibitions in the future.

Many states where VITAS operates have laws similar to the Stark Law, but with broader effect because they apply regardless of the source of payment for care. Penalties similar to those listed above as well as the loss of state licensure may be imposed in the event of a violation of these state self-referral laws. Little precedent exists regarding the interpretation or enforcement of these statutes.

Civil Monetary Penalties. The Civil Monetary Penalties Statute provides that civil penalties ranging between $20,000 and $100,000 per claim or act (each adjusted for inflation) may be imposed on any person or entity that knowingly submits improperly filed claims for federal health benefits or that offers or makes payment to induce a beneficiary or provider to reduce or limit the use of health care services or to use a particular provider or supplier. Civil monetary penalties may be imposed for violations of the anti-kickback statute and for the failure to return known overpayments, among other things.

Prohibition on Employing or Contracting with Excluded Providers. The Social Security Act and federal regulations state that individuals or entities that have been convicted of a criminal offense related to the delivery of an item or service under Medicare or Medicaid programs or that have been convicted, under state and federal law, of a criminal offense relating to neglect or abuse of residents in connection with the delivery of a healthcare item or service cannot participate in any federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Additionally, individuals and entities convicted of fraud, that have had their licenses revoked or suspended, or that have failed to provide services of adequate quality also may be excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Federal regulations prohibit Medicare providers, including hospice programs, from submitting claims for items or services or their related costs if an excluded provider furnished those items or services. The OIG maintains a list of excluded persons and entities. Nonetheless, it is possible that VITAS might unknowingly bill for services provided by an excluded person or entity with whom it contracts. The penalty for contracting with an excluded provider may range from civil monetary penalties of $100,000 (as adjusted for inflation) and damages of up to three times the amount of payment that was inappropriately received.

Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting. Most states have laws that restrict or prohibit anyone other than a licensed physician, including business entities such as corporations, from employing physicians and/or prohibit payments or fee-splitting arrangements between physicians and corporations or unlicensed individuals. Penalties for violations of corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting laws vary from state to state, but may include civil or criminal penalties, the restructuring or termination of the business arrangements between the physician and unlicensed individual or business entity, or even the loss of the physician’s license to practice medicine. These laws vary widely from state to state both in scope and origin (e.g. statute, regulation, Attorney General opinion, court ruling, agency policy) and in most instances have been subject to only limited interpretation by the courts or regulatory bodies.

VITAS employs or contracts with physicians to provide medical direction and patient care services to its patients. VITAS has made efforts in those states where certain contracting or fee arrangements are restricted or prohibited to structure those arrangements, including its palliative care offerings, in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. Despite these efforts, however, the Company cannot assure that agency officials charged with enforcing these laws will not interpret VITAS’ contracts with employed or independent contractor physicians as violating the relevant laws or regulations. Future determinations or interpretations by individual states with corporate practice of medicine or fee splitting restrictions may force VITAS to restructure its arrangements with physicians in those locations.

Health Information Practices. There currently are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns. In particular, federal regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and the Health Information Technology for Electronic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) require VITAS to protect the privacy and security of patients’ individual health information and report any breaches. HIPAA and HITECH do not automatically preempt applicable state laws and regulations concerning VITAS’ use, disclosure and maintenance of patient health information, which means that VITAS is subject to a complex regulatory scheme that, in many instances, requires VITAS to comply with both federal and state laws and regulations and the continuing evolution of interpretations of them. If we are found to have violated these laws, we could be subject to sanctions, fines, damages, and other civil and criminal penalties. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the National Coordinator for the Health Information Technology recently published its final rule regarding interoperability and information blocking, designed to improve coordination within the healthcare system and patients’ access to their electronic health information. The penalty for violating the information blocking regulation may include civil monetary penalties.

Additional Federal and State Regulation.  Federal and state governments also regulate various aspects of the hospice industry. In particular, VITAS’ operations are subject to federal and state health regulatory laws covering professional services, the dispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities. Some of VITAS’ employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing the ethics and professional practice of medicine, respiratory therapy, pharmacy and nursing. 



Compliance with Health Regulatory Laws. VITAS maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters. The Company cannot assure, however, that VITAS’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect, including an effect on its brand reputation, on VITAS.

Environmental Matters

Roto-Rooter’s operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding environmental matters and other aspects of the operation of a sewer and drain cleaning, plumbing, and water restoration services business. For certain other activities, such as septic tank and grease trap pumping, Roto-Rooter is subject to state and local environmental health and sanitation regulations. 

At December 31, 2022, the Company’s accrual for its estimated liability for potential environmental cleanup and related costs arising from the 1991 sale of DuBois Chemicals Inc. (“DuBois”) amounted to $1.7 million. Of this balance, $899,000 is included in other liabilities and $826,000 is included in other current liabilities. The Company is contingently liable for additional DuBois-related environmental cleanup and related costs up to a maximum of $14.9 million. On the basis of a continuing evaluation of the Company’s potential liability, and in consultation with the Company’s environmental attorney, management believes that it is not probable this additional liability will be paid. Accordingly, no provision for this contingent liability has been recorded. Although it is not presently possible to reliably project the timing of payments related to the Company’s potential liability for environmental costs, management believes that any adjustments to its recorded liability will not materially adversely affect its financial position or results of operations. 

The Company, to the best of its knowledge, is currently in compliance in all material respects with the environmental laws and regulations affecting its operations. Such environmental laws, regulations and enforcement proceedings have not required the Company to make material increases in or modifications to its capital expenditures and they have not had a material adverse effect on sales or net income. Capital expenditures for the purpose of complying with environmental laws and regulations during 2021 and 2022 with respect to continuing operations are not material in amount; there can be no assurance, however, that presently unforeseen legislative enforcement actions will not require additional expenditures.

The Company’s environmental policy is available on its website at ir.chemed.com/corporate-governance/highlights under governance documents.

Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2022, the Company, including its subsidiaries Roto-Rooter and VITAS, had a total of 14,167 employees. 

As Roto-Rooter and VITAS are both service businesses, the Company recognizes and appreciates that our employees are crucial to our success, and that the attraction and retention of top talent, as well as the training and promotion of that talent, must be key focuses of our businesses. 

The Company’s Human Rights Policy is available on its website at: chemed.com/company/documents-charters under Governance Documents. 

Workforce Safety and Training
The Company’s continued success depends on maintaining a safe and healthy work force. Both Roto-Rooter and VITAS operate businesses where the safety of its employees is a significant focus. During the current pandemic, both businesses have adapted to new safety challenges, including sourcing PPE for employees and ensuring that it is available as needed, implementing new protocols in their offices or in dealing with customers and patients (including expanding telehealth offerings), contracting with third parties to ensure that COVID tests and vaccines are available, and making work-from-home or other different working arrangements available when feasible. 

Roto-Rooter’s safety program is designed to help ensure the safety of our employees and customers. Its “Safety Certified Program” is deployed to all field employees, including supervisors, managers, and sales personnel. The program includes trainings and policies that cover hazard assessment, environmental issues (including lead and asbestos), personal protective equipment, back support injury prevention, fire safety, and infectious disease (specifically including COVID-19 awareness and protocols). Roto-Rooter’s safety training also includes OHSA specific compliance and specialty training depending on the role of the individual, including topics such as electrical safety, torch safety, mainline drain machine safety, driving safety, and other OSHA awareness topics. Roto-Rooter employs regional safety managers, who are all OSHA authorized trainers, as well as other employees across its geographies who are authorized to provide OSHA training. Specialized roles, such as excavation and water restoration, receive specialized training. 



Roto-Rooter’s training also extends beyond safety and into human resources and other topics, depending on the role of the employee. All managers receive training in human resources topics, ranging from discrimination, to harassment, to workplace violence, leaves of absence, and other relevant matters. Additional training is given in other topics throughout employees’ careers, both on the job and in the classroom, specific to the roles of the employees. 

Similarly, VITAS has developed a safety program designed to help keep its employees and patients healthy and safe. In addition to its standard program, that includes trainings on standard safety issues including OSHA matters and other regulatory safety matters, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, VITAS has adapted to the changing landscape of the disease and guidance from the CDC and other regulatory agencies, and has put together dozens of trainings for its employees to help deal with continuing to provide safe patient care. These trainings covered topics such as information about the disease itself and transmissibility, hygiene, PPE usage and guidelines, telehealth visits, isolation and quarantining precautions, health checks, and other related areas, and were targeted to employees based on their roles within the Company. 

VITAS employs a learning management system to deploy and track training provided to its employees on a regular basis, across a range of topics in addition to the safety ones discussed above, including clinical areas, processes, functional areas, leadership topics, human resources topics (including diversity) and regulatory compliance (including HIPAA). Employees are provided training upon onboarding with the Company, and then periodically as appropriate for their individual roles. VITAS continually reviews and revises its trainings depending on business and regulatory risks, as well as the needs of its employees. For example, VITAS also has developed and made available personal healthcare wellness trainings, to help provide assistance to its employees deal with the stresses faced throughout the pandemic. 

Hiring, Retention, and Compensation
Both Roto-Rooter and VITAS are service providers, whose employees engage with their customers and patients on a daily basis. For both businesses, hiring and keeping productive employees is an essential function and focus of the business. 

Roto-Rooter’s focus on hiring and retaining the right people starts during the recruitment process, where both local and centralized teams are involved in the process. After hire, new employees are given appropriate training for their individual roles, with new hires in many roles being managed by a “Hiring Manager” for their first year of employment. Roto-Rooter instills as key values that part of each employee’s job is to both “Take Care of the Customer” and “Make it a Great Place to Work.” Through this focus, as well as a competitive compensation structure and promote-from-within culture, Roto-Rooter has been able to increase its workforce of technicians across the company during the difficult labor market of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

VITAS also focuses on hiring, training and promoting the right talent, and believes that its vision of providing the best available patient and family care is delivered by its committed and compassionate employees. It has an automated recruitment process, designed to increase efficiencies and decrease the time to fill open positions, as well as continue to grow its brand presence in the talent market. It has continued to adapt to the new hiring and retention challenges brought on by the pandemic and current healthcare labor environment on a market-by-market and role-by-role basis. For example, in order to help with the attraction and retention of healthcare workers during the pandemic induced healthcare worker shortage, VITAS adopted the “Difference Maker Program” in July 2022 which provides stay-bonuses, for eligible existing employees and new employees who are hired during the application of the program. 

Diversity
Maintaining a diverse and inclusive workforce is necessary to continue our success. Diverse perspectives help foster continued innovation. Moreover, as a provider of services, our businesses understand that a diverse and inclusive workforce is necessary to best identify and build relationships with our equally diverse customers and patients. Both Roto-Rooter and VITAS highly value diversity in their workplaces and have established and maintained diverse workforces that are constantly evolving to better resemble the communities and populations that we serve. 
Cybersecurity

The Company treats cybersecurity risk seriously and is focused on maintaining and regularly updating the security of our systems, networks, technologies and data. 

The number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate our systems continues to grow, specifically including the rapid increase on attempts against healthcare companies that was observed in early 2022. To combat the ever-increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, we are continuously working to improve methods for detecting and preventing attacks. We have implemented policies and procedures and developed specific training for our employees, including regular updates and reminders, to help prevent and mitigate any issues that may be caused by any attacks. Further, we regularly engage independent third-party cyber experts to test for vulnerabilities in our environment. We also conduct our own internal simulations to help assess and strengthen our defenses. 



We acknowledge that cyberattack risk may occur with our third-party technology service providers. High-profile cyberattacks have occurred at healthcare companies, credit bureaus, financial institutions, and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information of individuals, including potential customers and patients. We take measures to prevent and mitigate issues caused by any such attacks, including outreach to our providers and other third-parties that we engage with, in order to ascertain any potential downstream implications of known breaches.

To date, the increase in cyberattacks has not resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers or patients. However, while we have significant internal resources, policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur in the future, or if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. 

Senior management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors are regularly briefed on cybersecurity matters. 

Acquisitions

In 2022, Roto-Rooter acquired three franchises in New Jersey for a total of $2.29 million in cash. VITAS purchased the hospice assets of one Florida provider for $1.24 million in cash. 

No acquisitions were completed in 2021.

In 2020, Roto-Rooter completed the acquisition of a Roto-Rooter franchise and the related assets in Indiana for $2.2 million in cash.
