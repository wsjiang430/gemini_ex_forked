ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

GENERAL
Our Company was incorporated in Delaware in October 1986 as Terex U.S.A., Inc. Since that time, we have changed significantly, and much of this change has been historically accomplished through acquisitions and managing our portfolio of companies by divestiture of non-core businesses and products. Today, Terex is a global manufacturer of aerial work platforms, cranes and materials processing machinery. We design, build and support products used in construction, maintenance, manufacturing, energy, minerals and materials management applications. Our products are manufactured in North and South America, Europe, Australia and Asia and sold worldwide. We engage with customers through all stages of the product life cycle, from initial specification and financing to parts and service support. We continue to focus on becoming an industry leading operating company.
We manage and report our business in the following segments: (i) Aerial Work Platforms (“AWP”); (ii) Cranes; and (iii) Material Processing (“MP”).

OTHER
We may assist customers in their rental, leasing and acquisition of our products through Terex Financial Services (“TFS”). TFS uses its equipment financing experience to provide financing solutions to our customers who purchase our equipment. TFS continually evaluates the level to which it provides direct customer financing versus utilizing third party funding to meet its business objectives.
In the United States and on a limited basis in China, TFS originates and services financing transactions directly with end-user customers, distributors and rental companies. Most of the transactions are fixed and floating rate loans; however, TFS also provides sales-type leases, operating leases and rentals. In the normal course of business, loans and leases are sold to third party financial institutions. Globally, TFS facilitates financing transactions directly between our customers and third party financial institutions. In addition, wholesale financing may be arranged between dealers and distributors who sell our equipment and financial institutions with which TFS has established relationships.
TFS continually monitors used equipment values of Terex equipment in the secondary market sales channels for all of our equipment categories. This provides a basis to project future values of equipment for the underwriting of leases or loans. These secondary market sales channels are also used for re-marketing any equipment which is returned at end of lease, or is repossessed in case of a customer default. When equipment is received, TFS uses the resale channel which maximizes proceeds and/or mitigates risk for Terex and our funding partners.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Material Handling and Port Solutions (“MHPS”)
On January 4, 2017, we completed the disposition of our MHPS business (the “Disposition”) to Konecranes Plc (“Konecranes”). The MHPS business sold constituted the entirety of one of our previous reportable segments and comprised two of our six previous reporting units, represented a significant portion of our revenues and assets, and is therefore accounted for as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. The Disposition represented a significant strategic shift in our business away from universal, process, mobile harbor and ship-to-shore cranes that had a major effect on our operating results. 
See Note D – “Discontinued Operations and Other Divestitures” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Disposition and our discontinued operations.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On February 22, 2019, we entered into an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement (the “ASPA”) with Tadano Ltd. (“Tadano”). Pursuant to the ASPA, we are selling our Demag® mobile cranes business to Tadano for an enterprise value of $215 million (the “Transaction”). The consideration is being paid in cash and the cash received will be net of indebtedness. The purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustments based upon the level of net working capital and cash and debt in the Demag® mobile cranes business at the closing date. The products to be divested are our Demag® all terrain cranes and large lattice boom crawler cranes. The Transaction, which is subject to governmental regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is targeted to close in mid-2019. In addition to selling our Demag® mobile cranes business, we will exit the North American mobile crane product lines manufactured in our Oklahoma City facility.
As a result, we realigned certain operations formerly part of our Cranes segment. For financial reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, our utilities business will be consolidated within our AWP segment, our pick and carry cranes business will be consolidated within our MP segment and our rough terrain and tower cranes businesses will be consolidated within Corporate. Prior period reportable segment information will be adjusted in succeeding periods to reflect the realignment of our operations.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Terex is a specialized manufacturer of capital equipment and related services. Our goal is to design, manufacture and market equipment and services that provide superior life-cycle return on invested capital to our customers (“Customer ROIC”). Customer ROIC is a key focus of our organization and is central to our ability to generate returns for investors.
6

We operate our business based on our value system, “The Terex Way.” The Terex Way values shape the culture of our Company and reflect our collective commitment to what it means to be a part of Terex. The Terex Way is based on six key values:

• | Integrity: Integrity reflects honesty, ethics, transparency and accountability. We are committed to maintaining high ethical standards in all of our business dealings and we never sacrifice our integrity for profit.


• | Respect: Respect incorporates concern for safety, health, teamwork, diversity, inclusion and performance. We treat all our team members, customers and suppliers with respect and dignity.


• | Improvement: Improvement encompasses quality, problem-solving systems, a continuous improvement culture and collaboration. We continuously search for new and better ways of doing things, focusing on continuous improvement and the elimination of waste.


• | Servant Leadership: Servant leadership requires service to others, humility, authenticity and leading by example. We work to serve the needs of our customers, investors and team members.


• | Courage: Courage entails willingness to take risks, responsibility, action and empowerment. We have the courage to make a difference even when it is difficult.


• | Citizenship: Citizenship means social responsibility and environmental stewardship. We comply with all laws, respect all people’s values and cultures, and are good global, national and local citizens.

During 2016, Terex began implementing a strategic transformation that has three principal elements:

1. | Focus the portfolio on businesses best positioned to generate returns above the cost of capital through the cycle.


2. | Simplify company structure, systems and footprint to improve efficiency and enhance global competitiveness.


3. | Execute to Win, driving process discipline, execution rigor, and accountability in core processes.

The “Focus” element of this strategy concentrated our business portfolio in product categories where we are among the market leaders. Where we were not among the market leaders our strategy has been to either divest those product lines or pursue a business strategy which we believe will enable us to become a market leader. Work related to this strategic theme involved review of all businesses in the portfolio from the perspectives of market attractiveness and competitive position. Several portfolio actions were taken as a result, including the sale of our former MHPS segment and sale of certain of our former Construction segment product lines. Though the original objectives have been met, the principles on which the focus element was based will continue to be applied to our Company’s business portfolio. Businesses that do not lead in their markets or do not achieve reasonable return expectations will be reviewed. Meanwhile, businesses that do lead and do deliver attractive returns will be candidates for additional investment.
The “Simplify” element of the Terex strategy is centered on complexity reduction and cost management. Historically, Terex has grown through acquisitions and our businesses were generally operated autonomously. This resulted in a complex legal entity structure, multiple financial systems, and high organizational complexity. As part of our transformational strategy, we are addressing these issues and are implementing strategic initiatives to simplify our structure, footprint and processes. We are working to flatten and streamline the organization. We have undertaken finance initiatives to simplify the way that we measure and manage the Company day-to-day. We also simplified the Company’s manufacturing footprint by reducing the number of production facilities, sharing facilities across businesses, and driving aggressive productivity improvement within the facilities we operate. We operate capital goods businesses that must be efficiently managed in order to remain competitive and the definition of what it means to be efficient is constantly changing. Continued refinement of business processes and the effective deployment to modern technology are both important to the ongoing simplification of our Company.
The third major theme of the Terex strategy is Execute to Win, which is a focus on three key management processes: Talent development, strategy development and deployment, and operational excellence. Execute to Win represents a major change in the philosophy of our Company in terms of where and how work is done. Our goal is to become operationally excellent, balancing desire for business autonomy with the need for overall efficiency and relying on process excellence as a critical enabler of both business and company performance. We are implementing three specific near-term transformational priorities in our Execute to Win initiatives. 

1. | Lifecycle Solutions are comprehensive solutions that include our equipment and other offerings such as financing, spare parts, technical and repair services, operator training, and technology solutions that drive Customer ROIC.


2. | Commercial Excellence is about driving process discipline and execution in our commercial operations, such as sales, pricing, marketing, and sales support.


3. | Strategic Sourcing will involve implementing a standard, Terex-wide strategic sourcing process that will help us leverage our spending, thereby achieving lower costs from suppliers.

7

Each of these activities is being managed as a company-wide priority, with leadership from the center and support from within Terex businesses. Implementation involves a wide-ranging set of actions that are intended to deliver step-change performance improvement. These actions appropriately balance the unique needs of specific businesses with overall potential for efficiency and for leverage on investments. Our long-term financial plan includes major contributions in these three areas as well as improved processes that will become foundational drivers for differentiating Terex in the years ahead.
Capital allocation is an important part of our overall strategy. We view capital allocation priorities (in order) as follows:

1. | Maintain an optimal capital structure (~2.5 x average net debt to EBITDA over the cycle)


2. | Organic growth investments (product & service development, maintenance capex, geographic expansion)


3. | Restructuring investments (transformation initiatives, general & administrative cost reduction, footprint rationalization)


4. | Efficient return of capital to shareholders (dividends and share repurchases)

During 2018, we returned $455 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
PRODUCTS
AERIAL WORK PLATFORMS
AERIAL WORK PLATFORMS. Aerial work platform equipment position workers and materials easily and quickly to elevated work areas, enhancing safety and productivity at height. These products have been developed as alternatives to scaffolding and ladders. We offer a variety of aerial lifts that are categorized into six product families: portable material lifts; portable aerial work platforms; trailer-mounted articulating booms; self-propelled articulating and self-propelled telescopic booms; and scissor lifts.

• | Portable material lifts are used primarily indoors in the construction, industrial and theatrical markets.


• | Portable aerial work platforms are used primarily indoors in a variety of markets to perform overhead maintenance.


• | Trailer-mounted articulating booms are used both indoors and outdoors. They provide versatile reach, and they have the ability to be towed between job sites.


• | Self-propelled articulating booms are primarily used in construction and industrial applications, both indoors and outdoors. They feature lifting versatility with up, out and over position capabilities to access difficult to reach overhead areas.


• | Self-propelled telescopic booms are used outdoors in commercial and industrial construction, as well as highway and bridge maintenance projects.


• | Scissor lifts are used in indoor and outdoor applications in a variety of construction, industrial and commercial settings.

TELEHANDLERS. Telehandlers move and place materials on residential and commercial construction sites and are used in the energy and infrastructure industries.
LIGHT TOWERS. Trailer-mounted light towers are used primarily to light work areas for construction, entertainment, emergency assistance and security during nighttime or low light applications.
8

CRANES
We offer a wide variety of cranes, including mobile telescopic cranes, lattice boom crawler cranes, tower cranes, and utility equipment.
MOBILE TELESCOPIC CRANES. Mobile telescopic cranes are used primarily for industrial applications, in commercial and public works construction, and in maintenance applications to lift equipment or material. We offer a complete line of mobile telescopic cranes, including rough terrain cranes, truck cranes, truck-mounted cranes (boom trucks), all terrain cranes and pick and carry cranes.

• | Rough terrain cranes move materials and equipment on rugged or uneven terrain and are often located on a single construction or work site for long periods. Rough terrain cranes cannot be driven on highways (other than in Italy) and accordingly must be transported by truck to the work site.


• | Truck cranes have two cabs and can travel rapidly from job site to job site at highway speeds. Truck cranes are often used for multiple local jobs, primarily in urban or suburban areas.


• | Truck-mounted cranes (boom trucks). We manufacture telescopic boom cranes and articulated hydraulic cranes for mounting on a commercial truck chassis. Truck-mounted cranes are used primarily in the construction and maintenance industries to lift equipment or materials to various heights. Boom trucks are generally lighter and have less lifting capacity than truck cranes, and are used for many of the same applications when lower lifting capacities are sufficient. An advantage of a boom truck is that the equipment or material to be lifted by the crane can be transported by the truck, which can travel at highway speeds. Applications include delivery of building materials and the installation of commercial air conditioners and other roof-mounted equipment, and the erection of transmission towers and substation equipment in the electrical grids. 


• | All-terrain cranes are a cross between rough terrain and truck cranes, and are designed to travel across both rough terrain and highways.


• | Pick and carry cranes are designed for a wide variety of applications, including use at mine sites, large fabrication yards, building and construction sites and in machinery maintenance and installation. They combine high road speed with all-terrain capability.

LATTICE BOOM CRAWLER CRANES. Lattice boom crawler and lattice boom pedestal cranes are designed to lift material on rough terrain. The boom is made of tubular steel sections, which, together with the base unit, are transported to and erected at a construction site. Applications include infrastructure building, wind turbine erection, construction of nuclear power and petrochemical plants and heavy lifting within oil refineries and the construction industry.
TOWER CRANES. Tower cranes are often used in urban areas where space is constrained and in long-term or very high building sites. Tower cranes lift construction material and place the material at the point of use. We produce the following types of tower cranes:

• | Self-erecting tower cranes unfold from sections and can be trailer mounted; certain larger models have a telescopic tower and folding jib. These cranes can be assembled on site in a few hours. Applications include residential and small commercial construction.


• | Hammerhead tower cranes have a tower and a horizontal jib assembled from sections. The tower extends above the jib into an A-frame to which suspension cables supporting the jib are attached. These cranes are assembled on-site in one to three days depending on height, and can increase in height with the project.


• | Flat top tower cranes have a tower and a horizontal jib assembled from sections. There is no A-frame above the jib, which is self-supporting and consists of reinforced jib sections. These cranes are assembled on-site in one to two days, and can increase in height with the project.


• | Luffing jib tower cranes have a tower and an angled jib assembled from sections. There is one A-frame above the jib to which suspension cables supporting the jib are attached. Unlike other tower cranes, there is no trolley to control linear movement of the load, which is accomplished by changing the jib angle. These cranes are assembled on-site in two to three days, and can increase in height with the project.

Our materials processing equipment includes crushers, screens and feeders, washing systems as well as wood and biomass chippers.
We manufacture a range of jaw, impactor (both horizontal and vertical shaft) and cone crushers, as well as base crushers for integration within mobile, modular and static plants.

• | Jaw crushers are used for crushing larger rock, primarily at the quarry face or on recycling duties. Applications include hard rock, sand and gravel and recycled materials. Cone crushers are used in secondary and tertiary applications to reduce a number of materials, including quarry rock and riverbed gravel.


• | Horizontal shaft impactors are primary and secondary crushers. They are typically applied to reduce soft to medium hard materials, as well as recycled materials. Vertical shaft impactors are secondary and tertiary crushers that reduce material utilizing various rotor configurations and are highly adaptable to any application.

Our screening and feeder equipment includes:

• | Heavy duty inclined and horizontal screens and feeders, which are used in low to high tonnage applications and are available as either stationary or heavy-duty mobile equipment. Screens are used in all phases of plant design from handling quarried material to fine screening. Dry screening is used to process materials such as sand, gravel, quarry rock, coal, ore, construction and demolition waste, soil, compost and wood chips.


• | Feeders are used to unload materials from hoppers and bulk material storage at controlled rates. They are available for applications ranging from primary feed hoppers to fine material bin unloading. Our range includes apron feeders, grizzly feeders and pan feeders.

Washing system products include mobile and static wash plants incorporating separation, washing, scrubbing, dewatering and stockpiling. We manufacture mobile and stationary rinsing screens, scrubbing systems, sand screw dewaterers, bucket-wheel dewaterers, water management systems, hydrocyclone plants for efficient silt extraction and a range of stockpiling conveyors. Washing systems operate in the aggregates, recycling, mining and industrial sands segments.
Wood processing, biomass and recycling equipment includes shredders, grinders, trommels, chippers, compost turners and specialty systems. This equipment is used in, among other things, recycling, wood energy, green waste/construction, demolition recycling industries and pulp and paper.
We manufacture a range of conveyors which include tracked mobile conveyors. Conveyors are mechanical machines used to transport and stockpile materials such as aggregates and minerals after processing.

BACKLOG
Our backlog as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:

 | December 31, 
 | 2018 | | 2017
 | (in millions)
AWP | $ | 867.9 | | | $ | 763.0 
Cranes | 583.3 | | | 550.4 | 
MP | 490.5 | | | 317.7 | 
Total | $ | 1,941.7 | | | $ | 1,631.1

We define backlog as firm orders that are expected to be filled within one year, although there can be no assurance that all such backlog orders will be filled within that time. Our backlog orders represent primarily new equipment orders. Parts orders are generally filled on an as-ordered basis.
Our management views backlog as one of many indicators of the performance of our business. Because many variables can cause changes in backlog and these changes may or may not be of any significance, we consequently view backlog as an important, but not necessarily determinative, indicator of future results.
Our overall backlog amounts at December 31, 2018 increased $310.6 million from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher orders across all business segments. The negative impact of foreign exchange rate changes on 2018 backlog was approximately 3% when compared to 2017.
AWP segment backlog at December 31, 2018 increased approximately 14% from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2017. This increase from the prior year was driven primarily by higher orders in North America and Asia.
Cranes segment backlog at December 31, 2018 increased approximately 6% from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2017. This increase from the prior year was driven primarily by higher orders in our Utilities business.  The negative impact of foreign exchange rate changes on 2018 backlog was approximately 2% when compared to 2017. 
MP segment backlog at December 31, 2018 increased approximately 54% from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2017. This increase from the prior year was driven primarily by increased demand for crushing and screening products globally and concrete mixer trucks in North America. Foreign exchange negatively impacted 2018 backlog by approximately 6% when compared to 2017.

Demag® is a registered trademark of Demag IP Holdings GmbH, which is a joint venture owned 50% by Terex and 50% by Konecranes.
We have many patents that we use in connection with our operations and most of our products contain some proprietary technology. Many of these patents and related proprietary technology are important to the production of particular products; however, overall, our patents, taken together, are not material to our business or our overall financial results.
Currently, we are engaged in various legal proceedings with respect to intellectual property rights. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in aggregate, on our business or operating performance. For more detail, see Item 3 – “Legal Proceedings.”
SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
As part of The Terex Way, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for our team members, and strive to provide quality products that are safe to use and operate in an environmentally conscious and respectful manner.
We generate hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations. All of our employees are required to obey all applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations and must observe the proper safety rules and environmental practices in work situations. These laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, and require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. These laws and regulations would also impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances, should any such events occur. We are committed to complying with these standards and monitoring our workplaces to determine if equipment, machinery and facilities meet specified safety standards. Each of our manufacturing facilities is subject to an environmental audit at least once every five years to monitor compliance and no incidents have occurred which required us to pay material amounts to comply with such laws and regulations. We are dedicated to ensuring that safety and health hazards are adequately addressed through appropriate work practices, training and procedures. For example, we continue to reduce lost time injuries and work toward a world-class level of safety practices in our industry.
We are dedicated to product safety when designing and manufacturing our equipment. Our equipment is designed to meet all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards for use in their markets. We continually incorporate safety improvements in our products. We maintain an internal product safety team that is dedicated to improving safety and investigating and resolving any product safety issues that may arise.
Use and operation of our equipment in an environmentally conscious manner is an important priority for us. We are aware of global discussions regarding climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on global warming. We are increasing our production of products that have lower greenhouse gas emissions in response to both regulatory initiatives and anticipated market demand trends. For example, the newest diesel engine emission reduction program introduced in Europe, known as Stage V, is driving further engine emissions related product development and introduction in 2019. Our segments also offer products that use plug-in electric hybrid technology to save fuel, reduce emissions and reduce noise in residential areas.

Increasing laws and regulations dealing with the environmental aspects of the products we manufacture can result in significant expenditures in designing and manufacturing new forms of equipment that satisfy such new laws and regulations. Compliance with laws and regulations regarding safety and the environment has required, and will continue to require, us to make expenditures. We currently do not expect that these expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
SEASONAL FACTORS
Terex is a globally diverse company, supporting multiple end uses. Seasonality is a factor in some businesses, where annual purchasing patterns are impacted by the seasonality of downstream project spending. Specifically, our businesses can experience stronger demand during the second quarter, as customers in the northern hemisphere make investments in time for the annual construction season (April to October). We expect a normal historical sales pattern in 2019.
WORKING CAPITAL
Our businesses are working capital intensive and require funding to purchase production and replacement parts inventories, expenditures to repair, replace and upgrade existing facilities, as well as funding to finance receivables from customers and dealers. We have debt service requirements, including semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding notes and quarterly interest payments on our bank credit facility. We believe cash generated from operations, together with availability under our bank credit facility and cash on hand, provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements. See Item 1A. – “Risk Factors” for a detailed description of the risks resulting from our debt and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business. We will continue to pursue cash generation opportunities, including reducing costs and working capital, reviewing alternatives for under-utilized assets, and selectively investing in our businesses to promote growth opportunities.
