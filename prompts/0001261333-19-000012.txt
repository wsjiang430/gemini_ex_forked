ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
DocuSign accelerates the process of doing business for companies and simplifies life for their customers and employees. We accomplish this by transforming the foundational element of business: the agreement.
As the core part of our broader software suite for automating the agreement process, we offer the world’s #1 e-signature solution. According to an October 2016 Forrester Research report, DocuSign is the “strongest brand and market share leader: the company name is becoming a verb.” 
Our value is simple to understand: the traditional, paper-based agreement process is manual, slow, expensive and error-prone. We eliminate the paper and automate the process. Doing so allows companies to measure turnaround time in minutes rather than days, substantially reduce costs and largely eliminate errors.
Our cloud-based software suite today enables over 475,000 companies and hundreds of millions of users to make nearly every agreement, approval process, or transaction digital—from practically any device, virtually anywhere in the world, securely. As of January 31, 2019, seven of the top 10 global technology companies, 18 of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies, and 10 of the top 15 global financial services companies are DocuSign customers. Since our founding in 2003, our customers have completed over one billion Successful Transactions on our platform. 
We attribute much of our success to our market-leading investment in technology and infrastructure. Our eSignature platform delivers over 99.99% availability, provides highly advanced security and offers hundreds of prebuilt partner connectors, along with an extensive application program interface, or API, for embedding and connecting DocuSign with other systems—all behind a simple and friendly user interface.
Our customers range from the largest global enterprises to sole proprietorships, across industries, around the world. Within a given company, our technology can be used broadly across business functions: contracts for sales, employment offers for human resources, non-disclosure agreements for legal, among many others. For example, one of our customers has implemented more than 300 such use cases across its enterprise. This broad potential applicability drives our e-signature total addressable market to be approximately $25 billion in 2017 according to our estimates, with substantial upside for automating aspects of the agreement process before and after the signature.
To address our opportunity, our sales and marketing strategy focuses on enterprise businesses, commercial businesses, and very small businesses, or VSBs. We rely on our direct sales force and partnerships to sell to enterprises and commercial businesses, and our web-based self-service channel to sell to VSBs, which is the most cost-effective way to reach our smallest customers. We offer subscriptions to our products, which include editions with varying functionality for different customers’ needs—as well as features specific to particular geographies or industries. We also focus on customer adoption, success and expansion. This helps us deliver continued value and creates opportunities for increased usage.
In addition, our marketing and sales efforts often benefit from the fact that many of our prospects already know us from being signers—for example, if they have “DocuSigned” a job offer or completed the purchase of a home via our eSignature platform. These experiences tend to have a meaningful impact on people’s lives, which is reflected by our strong Net Promoter Score of 66 as of June 2018. As a result, when we sell into these people’s companies, we often find that awareness and favorability toward DocuSign is already present among buyers and influencers.
The DocuSign Agreement Cloud
Since inception in 2003, DocuSign pioneered the development of e-signature and has led the market in managing digital transactions that were formerly paper-based. Today, we offer the world’s #1 e-signature solution as the core part of our broader cloud software suite for automating the agreement process. We call our suite the DocuSign Agreement Cloud.
The DocuSign Agreement Cloud is designed to allow companies of all sizes and across all industries to quickly and easily make nearly every agreement, approval process, or transaction digital—from practically any device, from almost anywhere in the world, securely. As a result, over 475,000 customers and hundreds of millions of users worldwide utilize DocuSign to create, upload and send documents for multiple parties to sign electronically. The DocuSign Agreement Cloud allows users to complete approvals, agreements and transactions faster by building end-to-end processes. DocuSign eSignature integrates 
with popular business apps, and our functionality can also be embedded using our API. Finally, the DocuSign Agreement Cloud allows our customers to automate and streamline their business-critical workflows to save time and money, while staying secure and legally compliant.
We help our customers address the challenge of modernizing the agreement process in the following ways:

• | Stringent security standards. We seek to meet the industry’s most rigorous security certification standards and use the strongest data encryption technologies that are commercially available. We believe our systems and processes also exceed industry practices for data protection, transmission and secure storage—including being certified for the global security gold standard, ISO 27001, among many other privacy and security certifications.


• | Always on. Our main infrastructure is powered by near real-time data synchronization across a ring of three geo-dispersed data centers in the United States, or U.S., and a similar ring of data centers in Europe. This infrastructure has enabled us to deliver over 99.99% availability to our eSignature customers and users worldwide over the past 24 months.


• | Globally adopted and auditable. Our domain expertise in e-signature and the management of digital transactions has enabled us to create a truly global offering. This is key, given that different regions have different laws, standards and cultural norms. We enable multiple parties in different jurisdictions to complete agreements and other documents in a legally valid manner. In Europe, we have Standards-Based Signature, or SBS, technology that is tailored for the European Union's, or EU’s, eIDAS regulations. To follow longstanding tradition in Japan, we enable signers to upload and apply their personal eHanko to represent their signatures on an agreement. In addition, once any agreement is electronically signed, our cryptographic technology secures documents and signatures with tamper-evident seals. We also offer a court-admissible Certificate of Completion for transactions—including party names, email addresses, public IP addresses, and a time-stamped record of individuals’ interactions with the document.


• | Embedded in widely used business applications. We offer more than 300 prebuilt integrations with applications such as those offered by Google, Microsoft, NetSuite, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, SAP SuccessFactors and Workday. Additionally, using our API, companies can integrate DocuSign into their own custom apps. These integrations allow customers to sign, send and manage agreements from the systems in which they already conduct business. For example, because of an integration that embeds DocuSign functionality into the Salesforce user experience, a sales representative can create and execute an agreement via DocuSign without ever leaving the Salesforce application. Behind the scenes, account data from Salesforce can automatically pre-fill the agreement. After signature, DocuSign can pass any other data collected or generated in the agreement process back to Salesforce.


• | Simple to use. For the past 15 years, we have sought to simplify and accelerate the process of doing business for multiple types of users. For authors of agreements, our user interface is simple and intuitive, streamlining and expediting even the most complex agreement processes between multiple parties. For signers of agreements, we offer a standalone web application, as well as the most downloaded mobile app in its category in the U.S. for iOS and Android, to allow people to review, sign, send and manage agreements from nearly anywhere in the world, securely. For developers, our robust API enables DocuSign to be quickly embedded into a company’s own apps, systems and processes, allowing them to shape a unique DocuSign experience to meet their business needs. This has led to nearly 60% of the transactions on our eSignature platform being driven through our API today.

We believe these key elements provide the following primary benefits:

• | Accelerated transactions and business processes. By replacing manual, paper-driven processes with automated digital workflows, DocuSign can substantially reduce the time and labor necessary to complete agreements. In fiscal 2019, 82% of all Successful Transactions on our eSignature platform were completed in less than 24 hours and 49% within 15 minutes—compared to the days or weeks common to traditional methods. This can deliver significant time and productivity savings to companies and their customers alike.


• | Improved customer and employee experience. Companies that use DocuSign internally and externally can deliver a simpler, faster and better experience for their own customers and employees. The challenge of faxing, scanning, emailing, mailing, couriering or other manual activities associated with the agreement process is eliminated—giving back time, one of the things people value most in todays’ accelerated world. DocuSign user experiences are as wide— ranging as people selling their house while on a ski lift to approving urgent business deals at 30,000 feet on a plane. We believe DocuSign drives the kind of experience and satisfaction that leads people to say they cannot imagine doing business any other way.


• | Reduced cost of doing business. According to a 2015 third-party study of certain of our enterprise customers we commissioned from IntelliCap, enterprise customers realized an average of $36 of incremental value (with a typical range from $5 to $100 per document depending on use case) per transaction when they deployed DocuSign versus their existing paper-based processes. IntelliCap performed the study by engaging with customers to develop “a deep understanding of DocuSign’s value drivers based upon hundreds of use cases and thousands of data points.” The value generated was attributed to hard dollar savings—such as the reduced consumption of paper, printer and copier consumables, envelopes, postage, and the benefit of paper-free storage and management of documents—and the benefits

from improved efficiencies and greater productivity across uses cases. As companies, particularly larger enterprises, eliminate the friction inherent in processes that involve people, documents and data, we believe they can see improved sales productivity, increased conversion rates and higher customer retention.
Our Growth Strategy
We intend to drive the growth of our business by executing on the following strategies:

▪ | Drive new customer acquisition. Despite our success to date, we believe the market for e-signature remains largely underpenetrated. As a result, there is a vast opportunity to take our core capabilities to many more enterprises, commercial businesses, and VSBs around the world. We estimate that our total customer base of over 475,000 customers represents 1% of the estimated enterprises, commercial businesses, and VSBs worldwide located in our current core target market.


• | Expand use cases within existing customers. A company’s first exposure to DocuSign is often when our e-signature solution is used to accelerate the execution of sales agreements. Once a company begins to realize the benefits, we often have an opportunity to expand into other use cases-going beyond sales into services, human resources, finance, and other functions-thereby increasing the overall number of agreement processes that are automated. For example, one large customer has grown from a single initial use case to over 300 as of January 31, 2019. As the vast majority of our customers have only automated a few use cases thus far, we believe there is strong potential to expand within our existing base. We will pursue this by augmenting our dedicated customer success team to identify and drive adoption of new use cases.


• | Accelerate international expansion. In the year ended January 31, 2019, we derived 17% of our revenue from customers outside the U.S. We believe there is a substantial opportunity for us to increase our international customer base by leveraging and expanding investments in our technology, direct sales force and strategic partnerships around the world, as well as helping existing U.S.-based customers manage agreements across their international businesses. We expect our eIDAS-compliant Standards-Based Signature currently offered in the EU and eHanko functionality for Japan to help support our international growth.


• | Expand vertical solutions. While our overall value proposition is universal, we will continue to invest in sales, marketing and technical expertise across several industry verticals, each of which have differentiated business requirements. We intend to continue offering solutions for important verticals, such as with digital-closing solutions in real estate, to help digitize the buying and selling process from lead to close. We see opportunities to further tailor our technology offerings to other vertical markets—such as with healthcare and life sciences companies, or by leveraging our Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, authorization to help drive e-signature adoption across U.S. federal government agencies.


• | Strengthen and foster our developer community. With over 130,000 developer sandboxes created, which enable product development and testing in isolated environments, and nearly 60% of transactions on our eSignature platform processed via our API today, we believe we have a strong developer community. Our easy-to-use and robust API allows developers to extend and integrate DocuSign into their own applications. These developers help expand DocuSign’s functionality to other systems, thus driving greater usage of our offerings. We intend to continue investing in our API and other forms of support to further drive this virtuous cycle of value creation between developers and DocuSign.


• | Extend across the entire agreement process. With our acquisition of SpringCM, Inc., or SpringCM, in September 2018, we extended DocuSign’s capabilities across the entire agreement process. To help customers further unify and automate the agreement process, we expect to make additional investments in extending and enhancing our applications, integrations and platform technologies. We also expect to expand our direct sales force, dedicated customer success team and strategic partnerships around the world.

Our Products
The DocuSign Agreement Cloud enables companies to make nearly every agreement, approval process or transaction digital. It provides comprehensive functionality across e-signature and addresses the broader agreement process:

• | Preparing an agreement. Users can create, upload and send documents for multiple parties to sign electronically in a legally valid and auditable way.


• | Circulating an agreement. Users can route agreement documents for review, comment and signature. At any time, the agreement originator can see each participant’s status in the process.


• | Signing an agreement. Our eSignature platform uses various methods to verify and authenticate the identities of document signers. It also has multiple region-specific methods for enabling signers to execute legally valid e-signatures.


• | Activating and managing an agreement post-signature. The DocuSign Agreement Cloud enables securely retaining, retrieving and reporting on agreements. In addition, companies can activate their business processes based on completed

agreements—for example, to automatically provision an account based on a customer agreement that was just completed, or to execute a payment.

• | Integrating agreement processes with other systems. Our eSignature platform is designed to allow businesses to integrate DocuSign functionality into their existing systems. In many cases, we will already have a prebuilt integration with a customer’s existing applications. In other cases, our API can be used to create an integration.

We offer the following eSignature product editions with varying combinations of functionality:

• | Trial: Send documents for signature, basic fields, such as signature, date, name, and text, mobile app, basic workflows, real-time audit trail, integration with Box, Google Drive, Evernote and more, across multiple languages.


• | Personal (single-user): All the functionality of Trial, plus reusable templates.


• | Standard (multi-user): All the functionality of Personal plus reminders, notifications and personalized branding.


• | Business Pro: All the functionality of Standard plus payment collection, advanced fields, signer attachments, bulk send, PowerForms, collaborative fields, in-person signatures, and advanced authentication.


• | Enterprise Pro: All the functionality of Business Pro, plus partner integrations, Single Sign On, enterprise-level support, embedded signing, advanced administration/user management, advanced branding and customizable usage limits. In addition, companies can build their own processes and workflows using our API and partner connectors.

In addition to these editions, customers can also benefit from additional functionality and standalone products that add increased value or serve a specific business need. Select examples of these include:

• | SpringCM: SpringCM helps customers automate the agreement lifecycle before and after the signature, making it an excellent complement to DocuSign eSignature. SpringCM includes technologies for automated document generation, redlining, advanced document management and end-to-end agreement workflow.


• | Standards-Based Signatures: Digital signature solutions—such as those required under the eIDAS regulations in the EU or Title 21 CFR Part 11 in the U.S.—have traditionally sacrificed convenience and capability in favor of compliance, often requiring desktop applications, software downloads and complex plug-ins to work. To solve this problem and simplify the process, we developed our SBS functionality—a way to identify a signer, issue or manage an authenticated digital certificate and then complete the transaction in accordance with regional regulations.


• | eHanko: DocuSign provides customers with the option to apply a stamp to represent their signature, official approval or company acknowledgment to documents. Specifically for Japan, the adoption of e-signatures has been influenced by the fact that signers are accustomed to using a hanko stamp to represent their signature on paper documents. We developed eHanko functionality, allowing signers to upload and apply their personal eHanko to represent their signature on an agreement.


• | DocuSign Rooms for Real Estate: DocuSign Rooms for Real Estate provides a way for brokers and agents to manage the entire real estate transaction digitally. It enables the creation and editing of documents; custom approval processes and workflows for sharing and signing those documents; integration with zipForm and other providers to simplify the completion of paperless forms; and an API to ensure easy connection with CRM systems, accounting software and other real estate related systems.


• | DocuSign Payments: Payments enables our customers to collect signatures and payment in just one step—reducing collection times, increasing collection rates, reducing errors and associated risk, and saving time. In partnership with Stripe, Authorize.Net and Braintree payments, a PayPal product, DocuSign Payments enables companies to accept credit cards, debit cards, ACH payments, Apple Pay and Android Pay.


• | eNotary: To simplify the often time-consuming and inconvenient task of having documents notarized during signature, DocuSign offers the ability to execute Electronic Notarial Acts. These Acts emulate the core aspects of a traditional paper/human Notarial Act. We offer our eNotary solution for electronic documents and records in states where eNotary has shown increasing prevalence, including California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington.

For eSignature, we price our subscriptions based on the functionality required by our customers and the quantity of Envelopes provisioned. Similar to how physical agreements were mailed for signature in paper envelopes historically, we refer to an Envelope as a digital container used to send one or more documents for signature or approval to one or more recipients. Our customers have the flexibility to put a large number of documents in an Envelope. For a number of use cases, such as buying a home, multiple Envelopes could be used.
Our Technology, Infrastructure and Operations
The core functions of our core eSignature platform are electronic signing and transaction processing, digital identity proofing, and legally valid execution of digital agreements. The architecture, design, deployment and management of our eSignature platform is therefore centered on innovation in the following areas:

• | Global security and privacy management. DocuSign’s foundation is built on industry-standard algorithms and patented cryptographic protocols. Distributed transactions are digitally signed and hash-validated for consistency. Our service protocols and operations meet or exceed some of the most stringent U.S., EU and global security standards. DocuSign is ISO27001 and SSAE 18, SOC 1 Type 2, SOC 2 Type 2, PCI, BCR and FedRAMP Certified.


• | High availability and enterprise-class manageability. Recognizing that our customers often depend on DocuSign for their day-to-day operations, we are committed to providing best-in-class availability. As such, we have delivered over 99.99% eSignature availability to our customers and users worldwide over the past 24 months, and we have required no downtime or maintenance windows. Our eSignature services are designed as an always-on, geographically redundant and distributed cloud solution that runs in SSAE 18 audited data centers in the U.S. and EU. We offer near real-time secure data replication and encrypted archival. Additional best practices and technologies are employed to protect customer data, including secure, private SSL 256 bit viewing sessions, application-level Advanced Encryption Standard 256-bit encryption, anti-tampering controls and digital certificate technology. Digital certificate issuance, document storage and display services can be performed either in the DocuSign cloud service or in a hybrid configuration using a DocuSign Signature Appliance hosted on-site or by partners in our network. DocuSign’s own internal systems and operations include physically and logically separate networks; two-factor encrypted VPN access; professional, commercial-grade firewalls and border routers; and distributed Denial of Service mitigation. A proprietary production telemetry system aids in active monitoring and alerting based on billions of points of operational data each day. We also leverage public cloud infrastructure in certain select international locations.


• | Extensible identity proofing model. DocuSign eSignature provides a range of options for authenticating users and proving their identities. We support single-sign-on and two-factor authentication for access to the platform. And for the agreement process, we enable the rapid validation of first-time signers who are not account holders. As a result, the certificate of completion—which is court-admissible and contains identity evidence and forensics—is available for all parties. To be compliant with regulations in different countries, DocuSign offers identity proofing for e-signatures, advanced electronic signatures and qualified electronic signatures, or QES. For QES, the identity certificate can be issued by DocuSign or a third-party trust service provider. And for customers in highly regulated industries, it can be generated using our proprietary on-premise solution. This solution offers customers the choice to deploy from a hybrid cloud model or behind their firewall, integrated with the most popular ID management systems for strong identity verification.


• | Scalable e-signature and transaction processing. At the heart of our solution is an e-signature capture experience that is underpinned by a robust, proprietary digital transaction-processing platform. That platform is designed to convert even the most complicated documents from different formats into one encrypted and consistent form. Signatures can then be captured in our web application, mobile app for iOS and Android, or via signing experiences embedded in custom applications. In addition to signatures, DocuSign ‘tags’ also permit the capture of user input during the signing and sending process and integrate deeply with business or third-party partner systems via dynamic data binding. And we do all this at global scale, dynamically routing, rendering, versioning and storing more than 1.5 million documents per day in the year ended January 31, 2019.


• | Integration into companies’ systems and processes. Companies can incorporate DocuSign eSignature into the fabric of their business systems and processes by using one of more than 300 pre-built connectors, or via a custom integration using our API. For a custom integration, the DocuSign Developer Center offers mobile or web app developers with software development kits and technical documentation for our comprehensive representational state transfer API-helping them to integrate signing or sending experiences into their own applications. They can also use DocuSign Connect—a real-time transactional event delivery service—to initiate specific actions when Envelopes originate, a workflow advances, or signing completes. In addition, solutions are available from other partners that provide vaulting, reporting and data storage extensions, if needed.

Research and Development
Since inception, we have invested to build the leading e-signature solution as the core part of our broader software suite for automating the agreement process. Our product and engineering team is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our solutions. 
Our Customers
As of January 31, 2019, we had over 475,000 paying customers globally, serving the needs of some of the largest enterprises and governmental organizations down to sole proprietors and individual end users. Our solutions meet the needs of all manner of industry categories-including real estate, financial services, insurance, health care, life sciences, government, higher education, communications, retail, manufacturing, travel and nonprofit—as well as the diverse number of customer-facing and back—office use cases within organizations-including sales, marketing, services, procurement, human resources, 
IT, legal and others. As of January 31, 2019, seven of the top 10 global technology companies, 18 of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies, and 10 of the top 15 global financial services companies are DocuSign customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for any of the periods presented.
Sales, Marketing and Customer Success
Our sales and marketing teams are focused on driving adoption and expanded use of DocuSign’s products by customers and prospects across North America, EMEA, Australia, Southeast Asia, Japan and Latin America. We benefit greatly from our strong brand recognition given our association with the positive signing moment in millions of people’s lives—such as accepting a job or buying a house—which can create a marketing halo effect that helps influence the adoption of our solution at their companies.
Given that our offerings are designed to solve the needs of companies of all sizes and across all industries and geographies, we sell to the following customer bases: enterprises, commercial businesses and VSBs. Our go-to-market strategy leverages our direct sales force and partnerships to sell to enterprises and commercial businesses, and our web-based self-service channel to sell to VSBs, which is the most cost-effective way to reach our smallest customers. We also employ tailored go-to-market strategies by industry verticals, including real estate, financial services, insurance, health care and life sciences, government, higher education, communications, retail, manufacturing, nonprofits and more. We focus on bringing value to every department inside those verticals, including sales, marketing, services, purchasing, procurement, human resources, IT, legal, among many others.
Sales
Our go-to-market model involves a combination of direct sales, partner-assisted sales and web-based self-service purchasing:

▪ | Direct Sales: We sell subscriptions primarily through our direct sales force across our field offices around the world. Our account executives and account managers focus on new and existing enterprise and commercial customers. Our direct sales team focuses on companies looking to streamline front office operations (e.g., sales, services or marketing) and back office operations (e.g., human resources, procurement, finance or legal). By expanding within an organization, we believe we can generate large amounts of incremental revenue through the addition of new users and Envelopes, plan upgrades, and expansions to other departments or business units.


▪ | Partner-assisted Sales:


▪ | Global partners: We have partnerships with some of the world’s foremost technology providers—including Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and SAP—that help us sell into a far greater number of accounts than we could do alone. These partnerships are multi-dimensional and involve joint investments, technology integrations, co-marketing agreements, membership of partner programs and go-to-market commitments.


▪ | Systems integrators: We have strong partnerships with strategic systems integrators such as Bluewolf (an IBM company), among others. These relationships are key given that those firms act as strategic technology advisors to some of the world’s most sophisticated enterprises. We have also developed relationships with some leading regional systems integrators and intend to increase our focus on this important group in the future.


▪ | ISV resellers: We partner with a host of leading independent software vendors—including our strategic partners above and including other companies like Ellie Mae and Guidewire—to help bring the power of DocuSign to customers around the world.


▪ | Distributors and resellers: As part of our evolving go-to-market strategy, we have distribution partnerships with global industry leaders like Ingram Micro and AppDirect, enabling us to reach tens of thousands of resellers (or “cloud solution providers”). We also have partnerships with solution providers such as Deutsche Telekom and others that have expertise in specific vertical and regional markets, enabling us to add further value directly to those markets.


▪ | Web-based Sales: Through a strong presence that allows us to scale to individual users and small businesses around the world with low acquisition costs, we drive free 30-day trial and self-service solutions directly on our website. The web-based sales engine provides direct access to account plans with functionality to suit the needs of small businesses, sole proprietors, and individuals.

Marketing
To support the sales team in reaching this broad range of potential customers, our integrated marketing programs are architected to address the specific needs of the different market segments. They create qualified sales opportunities and raise awareness of our leadership position in the global e-signature and broader agreement-technology space.
In addition to account-based marketing aimed directly at our high-value customers and industry-specific marketing by our industry vertical teams, we also deploy a range of other marketing strategies and tactics. These include broader digital demand generation campaigns; corporate communications and analyst relations; first-party events, such as DocuSign Momentum, the annual gathering of customers, prospects, developers and partners; participation in third party events, such as Salesforce’s Dreamforce; comprehensive customer evidence and advocacy programs; developer relations programs; cooperative marketing with strategic partners; and a comprehensive webinar series, among many other things. We also believe the ability for prospects to easily try DocuSign eSignature from www.docusign.com creates awareness that extends beyond the acquisition of new VSB customers.
Customer support and success
We believe that customer adoption, support and success are critical to retaining and expanding our customer base. Our customer support and success team handles the rapid onboarding of customers; offers a comprehensive DocuSign University that includes a range of free web-based classes on how to use, administer and customize our offerings; handles general technical or service questions; and is available to customers by telephone, email or the web.
We also offer a range of professional services to help customers get to the business results they desire. DocuSign Professional Services provides expertise to quickly and successfully identify business outcomes and then design, integrate and deploy the solutions that meet a customer’s needs. We offer in-depth expertise, proven best practices and repeatable delivery methodologies designed to ensure success, regardless of the complexity of the organization or technology environment.
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we had 3,023 employees, consisting of 619 in engineering, product development and customer operations, 1,789 in sales and services, 147 in marketing and operations and 468 in general and administrative. None of our employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Our Competition
Our primary global competitor currently is Adobe, which began to offer an electronic signature solution following its acquisition of EchoSign in 2011 (now known as Adobe Sign). Other global software companies may elect to include an electronic signature capability in their products. We also face competition from a select number of niche vendors that focus on specific industries or geographies.
We believe the principal factors that drive competition between vendors in the future will include:

• | breadth and depth of product-suite functionality;


• | breadth and depth of integrations with the applications and systems customers already use;


• | availability and reliability;


• | security;


• | ease of use and deployment;


• | brand awareness and reputation;


• | total cost of ownership;


• | level of customer satisfaction; and


• | ability to address legal, regulatory and cultural matters associated with e-signature across jurisdictions.

We believe we compete favorably across these factors. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—We face significant competition from both established and new companies offering e-signature solutions, which may have a negative effect on our ability to add new customers, retain existing customers and grow our business.”
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand.
10

As of January 31, 2019, we had 33 issued patents in the U.S. and 48 issued patents in foreign countries, which expire between December 2019 and July 2036, and 14 patent applications pending examination and one allowed patent applications in the U.S. and 18 patent applications pending examination and three allowed applications in foreign countries.
In addition, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by requiring our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.
Despite our efforts to protect our technology and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and other contractual protections, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and other technology. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our international operations, and effective intellectual property, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Further, companies in the communications and technology industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently threaten litigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We are currently subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—We are currently, and may in the future be, subject to legal proceedings and litigation, including intellectual property disputes, which are costly and may subject us to significant liability and increased costs of doing business. Our business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that our technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others.”
