Item 1. Business
The Company

We are a natural health and wellness company primarily engaged in the manufacturing and direct selling of nutritional and personal care products. We are a Utah corporation formed in 1976 with our principal place of business in Lehi, Utah, and sell our products to a sales force of independent consultants who use the products themselves or resells them to consumers.
Business Segments

We have four business segments (Asia, Europe, North America, and Latin America and Other) based primarily upon the geographic region where each segment operates, as well as the internal organization of our officers and their responsibilities. Each of the geographic segments operate under the Nature’s Sunshine Products and Synergy® WorldWide brands. The Latin America and Other segment includes our wholesale business in which we sell products to various locally-managed entities, independent of the Company, that we have granted distribution rights for the relevant market.
Product Categories
Our line of over 800 products includes several different product classifications, such as immune, cardiovascular, digestive, personal care, weight management and other general health products. We purchase herbs and other raw materials in bulk, and after rigorous quality control testing, we formulate, encapsulate, tablet or concentrate them, label and package them for shipment. Most of our products are manufactured at our facility in Spanish Fork, Utah. Contract manufacturers produce some of our products in accordance with our specifications and standards. We have implemented stringent quality control procedures to verify that our contract manufacturers have complied with our specifications and standards.
A summary of the U.S. dollar amounts from the sale of general health, immune, cardiovascular, digestive, personal care and weight management products for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, by business segment can be found in Note 12, “Operating Business Segment and International Operation Information,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8, Part 2 of this report.
The following table summarizes the Company’s product lines by category:
Category | Description 
General health | We distribute a wide selection of general health products. The general health line is a combination of assorted health products related to blood sugar support, bone health, cellular health, cognitive function, joint health, mood, sexual health, sleep, sports and energy, and vision.
Immune | We distribute immune products. The immune line has been designed to offer products that support and strengthen the human immune system. 
Cardiovascular | We distribute cardiovascular products. The cardiovascular line has been designed to offer products that combine a variety of superior heart health ingredients to give the cardiovascular system optimum support. 
Digestive | We distribute digestive products. The digestive line has been designed to offer products that regulate intestinal and digestive functions in support of the human digestive system. 
Personal care | We distribute a variety of personal care products for external use, including oils and lotions, aloe vera gel, herbal shampoo, herbal skin treatment, toothpaste and skin cleanser. 
Weight management | We distribute a variety of weight management products. The weight management line has been designed to simplify the weight management process by providing healthy meal replacements and products that increase caloric burn rate. 

Distribution and Marketing

We market our products primarily through our network of independent consultants, who market our products to customers through direct selling techniques and sponsor other independent consultants who also market our products to customers. We seek to motivate and provide incentives to our independent consultants by offering high quality products and providing independent consultants with product support, training seminars, sales conventions, travel programs and financial incentives.
We also utilize direct-to-consumer channels, selling our products through our own website as well as on other e-commerce platforms. This represents a relatively small part of our total business. 
Our products sold in the United States are shipped directly from our manufacturing and warehouse facilities located in Spanish Fork, Utah, as well as from our regional warehouses located in Georgia, Ohio and Texas. Many of our international operations maintain warehouse facilities and inventory to supply their independent consultants. However, in foreign markets where we do not maintain warehouse facilities, we have contracted with third-parties to distribute our products and provide support services to our force of independent consultants.
In the United States, we generally sell our products on a cash or credit card basis. From time to time, our U.S. operations extend short-term credit associated with product promotions. For certain of our international operations, we use independent distribution centers and offer credit terms that are generally consistent with industry standards within each respective country.
We pay sales commissions, or “volume incentives” to our independent consultants based upon their own product sales and the product sales of their sales organization. As an exception, in China, we do not pay volume incentives; rather, we pay independent service fees, which are included in selling, general and administrative expense. These volume incentives are recorded as an expense in the year earned. The amounts of volume incentives that we expensed during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, are set forth in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. In addition to the opportunity to receive volume incentives, independent consultants who attain certain levels of monthly product sales are eligible for additional incentive programs including automobile allowances, sales convention privileges and travel awards.
Source and Availability of Raw Materials

Raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are generally available from a number of suppliers. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we experienced complications in obtaining and maintaining adequate sources of raw materials supply. As of December 31, 2022, raw material availability has improved to near pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels; however, some items remain difficult to source. We attempt to ensure the availability of many of our raw materials by contracting, in advance, for our annual requirements. In the past, we have been able to find alternative sources of raw materials when needed. Although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in locating such sources of supply in the future, we believe that we will be able to do so.
Trademarks and Trade Names

We have obtained trademark registrations for Nature’s Sunshine®, and related logos for all of our Nature’s Sunshine Products product lines. We have also obtained trademark registrations for Synergy Worldwide® for all of our Synergy WorldWide product lines. We hold trademark registrations in the United States and in many other countries. Our customers’ recognition and association of our brands and trademarks with quality is an important element of our operating strategy.
The duration of our trademark registrations is generally between 10 and 20 years, depending on the country in which the marks are registered, and can be renewed. The scope and duration of our intellectual property protection varies throughout the world by jurisdiction and by individual product.
Seasonality

We operate in several regions around the world and, as a result, are affected by seasonal factors and trends such as weather changes, holidays and cultural traditions and vacation patterns throughout the world. For instance, in North America and Europe we may experience a decrease in activity during the third quarter due to the summer vacation season, while we experience a decrease in activity in many of our Asia Pacific markets during the first quarter due to cultural events such as the Lunar New Year. As a result, there is some seasonality to our revenues and expenses reflected in our reported quarterly results. Generally, reductions in one region of the world due to seasonality are offset by increases in another, minimizing the impact on our reported consolidated revenues. Changes in the relative size of our revenues in one region of the world compared to another could cause seasonality to more significantly affect our reported quarterly results.
Inventories

In order to provide a high level of product availability to our independent consultants, we maintain considerable inventory of raw materials in the United States and of finished goods in most countries in which we sell our products. Due to different regulatory requirements across the countries in which we sell our products, our finished goods inventories have product labels and sometimes product formulations specific for each country. Our inventories are subject to obsolescence due to finite shelf lives, among other considerations.
Dependence upon Independent Consultants

A significant amount of our revenue in some of our markets is dependent on only a few independent consultants and their extensive sales networks. The loss of one or more of these independent consultants who, together with their extensive sales network generate a significant amount of our revenue, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition on one or more of our business segments.
Backlog

We typically ship orders for our products within 24 hours after receipt of payment. As a result, we have not historically experienced significant backlogs due to our high level of product availability. However, due to disruptions in our supply chain, we have experienced modest increases in backlog that vary market to market.
Competition

Our products are sold in competition with other companies, some of which have greater sales volumes and financial resources than we do, and sell brands that are, through advertising and promotions, better known to consumers. We compete in the nutritional and personal care industry against companies that sell through retail stores, as well as against other direct selling companies. For example, we compete against manufacturers and retailers of nutritional and personal care products, which are distributed through supermarkets, drug stores, health food stores, vitamin outlets, discount stores, and mass market retailers, among others. We compete for product sales and independent consultants with many other direct selling companies, including Herbalife, LifeVantage, Nu Skin and USANA, among others. We believe that the principal components of competition in the direct selling of nutritional and personal care products are consultant expertise and service, product quality and differentiation, price and brand recognition. In addition, we rely on our independent consultants to compete effectively in the direct selling markets, and our ability to attract and retain independent consultants depends on various factors, including the training, quality product offerings and financial incentives for the independent consultants.
Research and Development

We conduct research at our research center, known as the Hughes Center for Research and Innovation, a state of the art research and development facility located at our corporate offices in Lehi, Utah. Our principal emphasis in our research and development activities is clinical research in the support of the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products. 
Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations

The nature of our business has not required any material capital expenditures to comply with federal, state or local provisions enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. No material capital expenditures to meet such provisions are anticipated. Such regulatory provisions did not have a material effect upon our results of operations or competitive position during the year ended December 31, 2022.
Regulation

General

In both the United States and foreign markets, we are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations and guidance, court decisions and similar constraints (collectively “Regulations”). Such Regulations exist at the federal, state or local levels in the United States and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions, including Regulations pertaining to: (1) the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of our products; (2) product and earnings claims and advertising, including direct claims and advertising by us, as well as claims and advertising by independent consultants, for which we may be held responsible; (3) our direct selling program; (4) transfer pricing and similar regulations that affect the level of U.S. and foreign taxable income and customs duties; (5) taxation of our independent consultants (which in some instances may impose an obligation on us to collect the taxes and maintain appropriate records); and (6) currency exchange and repatriation.
Products

The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of each of our major product groups are subject to regulation by one or more governmental agencies in the United States and in other countries. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates our products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended and the regulations promulgated thereunder (“FDCA”). The FDCA defines the terms “food” and “dietary supplement” and sets forth various conditions that, unless complied with, may constitute adulteration or misbranding of such products. The FDCA has been amended several times with respect to dietary supplements, including amendments by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

FDA regulations relating specifically to foods and dietary supplements for human use are set forth in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations include basic labeling requirements for both foods and dietary supplements. Additionally, FDA regulations require us to meet relevant good manufacturing practice regulations relating to, among other things, the preparation, packaging and storage of our food and dietary supplements.

FDA rules impose requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, holding, and distribution of dietary supplement products. For example, it requires that companies establish written procedures governing areas such as: (1) personnel, (2) plant and equipment cleanliness, (3) production controls, (4) laboratory operations, (5) packaging and labeling, (6) distribution, (7) product returns, and (8) complaint handling. The FDA also requires identity testing of all incoming dietary ingredients unless a company successfully petitions for an exemption from this testing requirement in accordance with the regulations. The current good manufacturing practices are designed to ensure that dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are not adulterated with contaminants or impurities, and are labeled to accurately reflect the active ingredients and other ingredients in the products. Within the requirements of ingredient identification, we confirm the levels, identity, purity and potency of ingredients listed our product labels to ensure quality and transparency for our product line. 
In some countries we are, or regulators may assert that we are, responsible for the conduct of our independent consultants, and regulations applicable to the activities of our independent consultants also affect our business. In these countries, regulators may request or require that we take steps to ensure that our independent consultants comply with regulations. The types of regulated conduct include: (1) representations concerning our products; (2) earnings representations made by us and/or our independent consultants; (3) public media advertisements, which in foreign markets may require prior approval by regulators; (4) sales of products in markets in which the products have not been approved, licensed, registered or certified for sale; and (5) classification by government agencies of our independent consultants as our employees.

In some markets, it is possible that improper product claims by our independent consultants could result in our products being reviewed by regulatory authorities and, as a result, being classified or placed into another category as to which stricter regulations are applicable. In addition, we might be required to make labeling changes.

We are unable to predict the nature of any future regulations, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. They could, however, require: (1) reformulation of some products not capable of being reformulated; (2) imposition of additional record keeping requirements; (3) expanded documentation of the properties of some products; (4) expanded or different labeling; (5) additional or different scientific substantiation regarding product ingredients, safety or usefulness; and/or (6) additional consultant 
compliance surveillance and enforcement action by us. Any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

In foreign markets, prior to commencing operations and prior to making or permitting sales of our products in the market, we may be required to obtain an approval, license, registration or certification from the country’s ministry of health or comparable agency. Prior to entering a new market in which a formal approval, license, registration or certificate is required, we work extensively with local authorities to obtain the requisite approvals. We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently.

Direct Selling

Our business practices and products are also regulated by the following United States governmental entities: the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”), Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Our activities, including our direct selling distribution activities, are also regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold.

The FTC, which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of all of our products in the United States, has in the past several years instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement and food companies and against manufacturers of weight loss products generally for false and misleading advertising of some of their products. The FTC closely scrutinizes the use of testimonials, the role of expert endorsers and product clinical studies. The FTC has in recent years investigated and taken enforcement action against direct selling companies for misleading representations relating to the earnings potential of an independent consultant within a company’s compensation plan, as well as appropriateness of the compensation plans themselves. At various times during the COVID-19 pandemic, the FTC sent warning letters to retailers of dietary supplements and direct selling companies for deceptive or scientifically unsupported claims that their products could effectively treat, prevent, diagnose or cure COVID-19. We cannot be sure that the FTC, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question our advertising or other operations in the future.

Transfer Pricing

In many countries, including the United States, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by our U.S. or local entities and are taxed accordingly. In addition, our operations are subject to regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of customs duties are assessed on the importation of our products.

Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions, we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed.

In the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to us, we may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of U.S. foreign tax credits. Because the laws and regulations governing U.S. foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment, we cannot be sure that we would in fact be able to take advantage of all foreign tax credits in the future.

Other Regulations

We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets, including regulations pertaining to social security assessments, employment and severance pay requirements, import/export regulations and antitrust issues. As an example, in many markets, we are substantially restricted in the amount and types of rules and termination criteria that we can impose on our independent consultants without having to pay social security assessments on behalf of the independent consultants and without incurring severance obligations to terminated independent consultants. In some countries, we may be subject to these obligations in any event.

Our failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in a particular market or in general. Assertions that we failed to comply with regulations or the effect of adverse regulations in one market could adversely affect us in other markets as well, by causing increased regulatory scrutiny in those other markets or as a result of the negative publicity generated in those other markets.

Compliance

In order to comply with regulations that apply to both us and our independent consultants, we conduct research into the applicable regulatory framework prior to entering any new market to identify all necessary licenses, registrations and approvals and applicable limitations on our operations in that market. Typically, we conduct this research with the assistance of local legal counsel and other representatives. We devote substantial resources to obtaining the necessary licenses, registrations and approvals and bringing our operations into compliance with the applicable limitations. We also research laws applicable to independent consultant operations and revise or alter our independent consultant manuals and other training materials and programs to provide independent consultants with guidelines for operating a business, selling and distributing our products and similar matters, as required by applicable regulations in each market. There are inherent limitations to our ability to monitor the activities of our independent consultants sufficient to ensure that they refrain, in accordance with our consultant agreements, from distributing our products in countries where we have not commenced operations.

In addition, regulations in existing and new markets often are ambiguous and subject to considerable interpretive and enforcement discretion by the responsible regulators. Moreover, even when we believe that we and our independent consultants are initially in compliance with all applicable regulations, new regulations regularly are being added and the interpretation of existing regulations is subject to change. Further, the content and impact of regulations to which we are subject may be influenced by public attention directed at us, our products or our direct selling program, so that extensive adverse publicity about our products or our direct selling program may result in increased regulatory scrutiny.

It is an ongoing part of our business to anticipate and respond to new and changing regulations and to make corresponding changes in our operations to the extent practicable. Although we devote considerable resources to maintaining our compliance with regulatory constraints in each of our markets, we cannot be sure that (1) we would be found to be in full compliance with applicable regulations in all of our markets at any given time or (2) the regulatory authorities in one or more markets will not assert, either retroactively or prospectively or both, that our operations are not in full compliance. These assertions or the effect of adverse regulations in one market could negatively affect us in other markets as well, by causing increased regulatory scrutiny in those other markets or as a result of the negative publicity generated in those other markets. These assertions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in a particular market or in general. Furthermore, depending upon the severity of regulatory changes in a particular market and the changes in our operations that would be necessitated to maintain compliance, these changes could result in us experiencing a material reduction in revenue in the market or determining to exit the market altogether. In this event, we would attempt to devote the resources previously devoted to such market to a new market or markets or other existing markets. However, we cannot be sure that this transition would not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition either in the short or long-term.

To further mitigate any compliance risk, a Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compliance Committee”) was created in 2014. The purpose of the Compliance Committee is to oversee our efforts with respect to operational compliance. “Operational Compliance” is defined by the Compliance Committee’s charter to include: consultant compliance and direct selling best practices; employee compliance, including code of conduct and other mandated trainings; product and product distribution regulatory compliance, including adherence to FTC, FDA and other similar regulatory bodies’ mandates; compliance with data protection regulations; and non-financial, whistleblower reports. For avoidance of doubt, “Operational Compliance” does not include adherence to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), which is the responsibility of the Audit Committee.
Human Capital

Attracting and retaining top talent is an integral part to our success. We intentionally build a workforce of people with viewpoints and backgrounds as diverse as the customers we serve around the world. As a responsibility to our team and in an evolving effort, we provide employees with meaningful careers and development opportunities to grow and succeed. 
We employed 800 individuals as of December 31, 2022. Our global workforce is comprised of the following ethnicities: 38.8 percent Caucasian, 33.3 percent Asian, 25.2 percent Hispanic, 2.1 percent Black, and 0.6 percent Other. Of those employees, 56.7 percent are female.
Some examples of our key programs and initiatives that are focused on attracting and retaining top talent include:
•Annual scholarship program for multicultural students at the University of Utah in the amount of $0.2 million.
•Leadership development program designed to help employees develop leadership skills and obtain executive coaching over a three-year period.
•Competitive wage and benefits package building loyalty and engagement in Company performance.
•Hybrid work model that recognizes the evolving needs of workers and allows them to build a hybrid work schedule providing greater flexibility for their personal needs.
•A wellness rewards program that rewards healthy behaviors such as healthy eating, exercise, and wellness ambassadorship. Participants have many reward options to choose from such as swag, gift cards, and product credit.
•Stringent safety standards and promotion of a company culture that prioritizes safety throughout our manufacturing and distributions centers around the world.
Sustainability
We believe that our focus on reliable, pure, proven, and potent ingredients and the processes through which ingredients are harvested sets our products and business apart. We emphasize collaborating with growers and suppliers that protect and care for the natural resources they farm and harvest along with the economic and social interests of their local communities. We choose supply partners with business models that value making a positive impact on the environments and economies that they source from and, in many cases, go to creative lengths to bring benefits to the communities they operate within. 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we accomplished our goal of using 100 percent renewable energy at our manufacturing facility. 
Noted below are the short- and long-term goals we have set to address the environmental impacts from our operations:
•50 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 & 2 by 2025;
•Zero waste at all distribution centers by 2025;
•35 percent waste reduction at our owned manufacturing facility by 2025;
