Item 1.    Business.
Financial Restatement
Power Solutions International, Inc. is filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 which contains audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The Company also included quarterly unaudited information for 2017 and 2016 within this Form 10-K, but it does not otherwise plan to file Form 10-Qs for such periods. The Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, included herein, restate and replace the Company's previously issued audited consolidated financial statements and related financial information which were filed with the SEC. Investors should rely only on the financial information and other disclosures regarding the Company's consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K or in future filings with the SEC (as applicable), and not on any previously issued or filed reports, earnings releases or similar communications relating to these periods.
Significant Events Since the Company's Last Regular Periodic Report
It has been almost three years since the Company’s last annual or quarterly periodic filing. In that time, the Company has expended significant resources to identify and undertake meaningful changes to remedy deficient operational and accounting controls, including significant changes to its management team and the Board of Directors (the “Board”), and has worked hard to restore the Company's credibility. These changes have resulted in meaningful disruption and change for the Company’s employees, investors and partners. The Company expects to continue to expend significant resources to address historical issues in its financial reporting.
Below is a summary of significant events that have occurred since the filing of the Company’s quarterly report for the period ended March 31, 2016:
Restatement Background
In August 2016, the Company announced that the Audit Committee (the “Audit Committee”) of the Board initiated an independent review of certain accounting matters conducted with the assistance of independent counsel and forensic accounting professionals engaged by the Audit Committee.
In December 2016, the Audit Committee reached preliminary findings with respect to the independent review and discussed the findings with the Board and senior management, which determined that the Company's previously issued consolidated financial statements for 2015, the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters within such fiscal year and the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016, as reported in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, should no longer be relied upon and should be restated to reflect the impact of certain errors involving revenue recognition.
The Company also reported that management’s report on the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, in each case for the relevant periods, and related reports of RSM U.S. LLP (“RSM”), the Company's 
4

then incumbent independent registered public accounting firm, should no longer be relied upon. Management also concluded that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed during each of the periods, requiring a restatement.
In January 2017, RSM resigned as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and recalled previously issued audit reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for 2015 and 2014.
In February 2017, the Board appointed Frazier & Deeter, LLC (“Frazier”) as the Company's new independent registered public accounting firm.
In April 2017, the Company determined that the previously issued consolidated financial statements for 2014 and the quarter ended March 31, 2015 should be restated to reflect the impact of certain errors involving revenue recognition. The Company reported that the foregoing financial statements, management’s report on the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting for 2014, and related reports of RSM, which were withdrawn, should no longer be relied upon.
In March 2018, the Audit Committee appointed BDO U.S.A., LLP (“BDO”) as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and dismissed Frazier as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
In October 2018, in light of additional information identified in connection with its ongoing restatement efforts, the Company determined that its previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 were materially misstated due to errors primarily relating to the capitalization of certain product development related expenses and inventory valuations. The Company reported that the 2013 financial statements, management's reports on the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting for 2013, and related reports of RSM should no longer be relied upon.
Effects of the Restatement
The restatement adjustments resulted in a cumulative net reduction to stockholders’ equity of $21.4 million and $4.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and a reduction in the Company's previously reported net income of $17.2 million and $2.2 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company also adjusted its December 31, 2013 stockholders’ equity to recognize corrected items that related to prior periods, decreasing equity by $2.9 million. 
The Board, Management, Internal Control and Reporting Improvements
As discussed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, included in Part II, the Company’s new management team has concluded that there were material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. Management is committed to the implementation of remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses. The remediation efforts summarized below, which have been or will be implemented, are intended both to address the identified material weaknesses and to enhance the Company’s overall internal control environment. These efforts include the following:

• | The Company has appointed a new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President, Internal Audit, with oversight from the Board and the Audit Committee consisting of new members;


• | The Company has updated its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and has initiated an ongoing training program to help ensure that employees understand and comply with the Code;


• | The Company will continue to enhance the program to provide extensive communications and training to employees across the entire organization regarding the importance of integrity and accountability;


• | In addition to naming a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has either replaced or appointed personnel for critical accounting positions with certified public accountants who have the appropriate level of public-company experience, including, among others, a Corporate Controller, a Director of Accounting and a Director of Financial Reporting; and


• | The Company has developed and begun implementing a more comprehensive internal controls program along with a formal, enterprise-wide remediation plan, including detailed and prioritized action plans, owners and a phased timeline. This remediation plan is overseen by an executive Internal Control Steering Committee, and progress will be communicated to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. The Internal Control Steering Committee is comprised of the following members: Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Vice President, Internal Audit, Chief Information Officer, Corporate Controller and Vice President of Operations.

In light of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company completed substantive procedures, including extensive temporary manual procedures and other measures, as needed to assist with meeting the objectives otherwise fulfilled by effective internal control over financial reporting. These procedures included, but were not limited to, conducting additional analysis and substantive procedures, and, in certain cases, correcting the accounting treatment and related disclosures for certain transactions. 
The Company also hired additional resources and retained outside consultants with relevant accounting experience, skills and knowledge, working under the Company's supervision and direction to assist with the account closing and financial statement preparation process. These additional procedures have allowed the Company to conclude that, notwithstanding the material 
5

weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting described above, the consolidated financial statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). 
When fully implemented and operational, the Company believes the measures, more fully described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, included in Part II, will remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses it has identified and will strengthen its internal control over financial reporting. The Company is committed to continuing to improve its internal control processes, and it will review its financial reporting controls and procedures on an ongoing basis. As the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, it may determine that a need exists to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or modify certain remediation measures.
Government Investigations
The SEC's enforcement staff informed the Company that it was conducting an investigation and issued a subpoena requiring the production of documents and information. In addition, the USAO is conducting a parallel criminal investigation into these matters. The Company is fully cooperating with the SEC and the USAO in their investigations, and it cannot predict the outcome of those investigations. The existence and the ultimate outcomes of such investigations could have a material adverse effect on the Company, the trading prices of its securities and its ability to raise additional capital. If the SEC or the USAO determines that the Company violated federal securities or other laws and institutes civil enforcement or criminal proceedings, the Company may face civil or criminal sanctions, including, but not limited to, criminal or civil charges, fines, other monetary penalties, injunctive relief and compliance conditions imposed by a court or agreement, which may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

Strategic Initiatives/Growth Strategies
The Company has initiated a comprehensive set of business objectives aimed at improving profitability, streamlining processes, strengthening the business and focusing on achieving growth in higher-return product lines. Key elements of these objectives and other initiatives are highlighted below.
Improve profitability
The Company has implemented a plan focused on enhancing profitability through the review of its customer and product portfolio. To date, this has resulted in strategic price increases in certain areas of the business, along with product redesign and the re-sourcing of certain components, to support improved margins. This program is a multiyear effort and will entail a strategic assessment of certain areas in which profitability does not meet established thresholds. The Company is also seeking opportunities to improve its profitability through the initiation of programs to improve manufacturing efficiency and working capital efficiency. It has also been investing heavily in the expansion of its heavy-duty engine product line, which has historically provided better margins. Further, the Company is in the early phases of production of certain products and anticipates potential benefits as it gains improved economies of scale through greater volumes. Lastly, since mid-2016, the Company has incurred substantial costs related to its restatement. The Company expects a meaningful reduction in certain of these costs once it completes the restatement efforts (see Note 2. Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data), files all delinquent periodic reports, including its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2018, and remediates its material weaknesses.

Streamlining of business processes
The Company has initiated an aggressive program to review and identify cost reductions throughout the organization. As part of this program, the Company is adopting tighter controls and monitors across major areas of spending and is centralizing certain business processes. 
Strengthening of business through the optimization of business systems and technology
The Company is working to strengthen its business through the optimization of its business systems and technology to support the remediation of internal controls, improve processes, drive greater operational efficiencies and provide better and timelier decision making across the organization. As part of this initiative, the Company is working on the reimplementation of its Enterprise Resource Planning system.
Increased emphasis on energy product offerings through new product development and investments
The Company has been a major participant in the energy market for many years as a supplier to several of the world’s leading power generation companies and through its large custom generator set enclosure (“genset”) business. Building on its broad product offering, in March 2018 and October 2018, the Company received EPA certification for its 32-liter and 40-liter heavy-duty engines, respectively, and has development and launch plans for a 53-liter model. These heavy-duty engines provide a natural-gas-fueled power range from 500 kWe to 1.25 MW, which is well above the Company's prior capabilities, allowing it to serve a greater portion of the demand response, microgrid, combined heat and power, and oil and gas markets. In addition to dedicating significant R&D resources within the energy market, the Company has also strategically invested in expanding its management, sales and operations staff to support these efforts. The Company’s heavy-duty engines have historically provided better margins.
Capitalize on key market trends
The Company's breadth of products and solutions will enable it to capitalize on numerous market trends that it believes have the potential to drive customer demand for its products and contribute toward its long-term growth. Further, the Company's R&D activity is largely focused on expanding its solutions to further address trends in these areas. The key trends include the following:

• | Increasingly stringent regulations and growing efforts to reduce emissions, which are driving demand for alternatives to diesel power engines (e.g., EPA Tier 4 emission standards, CARB regulations, MEE policies in China), in particular, in several markets such as the power generation market for oil and gas, school bus, arbor care and the China bus market, among others;


• | Growth in e-commerce activity around the world, which is driving demand for last-mile delivery vehicles;


• | The growth of intermittent sources of energy, such as wind and solar, which is driving increased demand for generators, microgrids and demand response equipment; and


• | The reduced availability of automotive engines that are suited for industrial application.

New product expansion by leveraging deep industry experience
Throughout the Company's history, it has evolved from a provider of diesel power systems to become a major supplier of power systems fueled by alternative fuels, including gasoline, propane and natural gas, among others. By leveraging the deep industry experience of its corporate engineering and new-product development teams, the Company is continuing to take steps to broaden the range of its power system product offerings, including engine classes and the OEM and direct user market categories into which it supplies products. The Company plans to capitalize on its technologically sophisticated, in-house design, prototyping, testing and application engineering capabilities to further refine its superior power system technology.
Leverage the Company’s relationship with Weichai
In March 2017, the Company executed a share purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with Weichai America Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Weichai Power Co., Ltd. (HK2338, SZ000338) (herein collectively referred to as “Weichai”). Under the terms of the SPA, Weichai invested $60.0 million in the Company (the “Weichai Transaction”) by purchasing a combination of newly issued Common and Preferred Stock as well as a stock purchase warrant, which significantly strengthened the Company's financial condition and contributed to the subsequent extinguishment of a $60.0 million term loan. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and Weichai also entered into a strategic collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) under which they have been working together to accelerate market opportunities for each company's respective product lines across various geographic and end-user markets.
The Collaboration Agreement provides the Company with strategic benefits, including the ability to leverage Weichai's strengths and capabilities in R&D, manufacturing, procurement and distribution and its widespread sales channels in China and other emerging markets. This collaboration has already enabled the Company to broaden its existing product portfolio, improve material quality, decrease costs, accelerate the development of new products and bring them to market, and expand access and exposure to new markets.
8

Among other things, the Collaboration Agreement establishes a joint steering committee, permits Weichai to second a limited number of certain technical, marketing, sales, procurement and finance personnel to work at the Company and establishes several collaborations, including with respect to stationary natural gas applications and Weichai diesel engines. The Collaboration Agreement also provides for the steering committee to create different subcommittees with various operating roles, and it otherwise governs the treatment of intellectual property of the parties prior to the collaboration and the intellectual property developed during the collaboration. The Collaboration Agreement has a term of three years.
Weichai is currently the Company's largest stockholder, holding 51.5% of the Company's outstanding Common Stock as of May 3, 2019. The Weichai stock purchase warrant, as last amended (the “Weichai Warrant”), was exercisable commencing on April 1, 2019 for such number of shares of the Company's Common Stock as was sufficient to provide Weichai with majority ownership of the Company's Common Stock. On April 23, 2019, Weichai exercised the Weichai Warrant resulting in the Company issuing 4,049,759 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (see Changes in Control section, included in Part III, Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, for additional information).
Expand global business
Through the expansion of its product lineup and the entry into new markets, including transportation, the Company has a history of growing its product offerings internationally beyond North America. The Company sees significant opportunity in continuing to grow its business worldwide with further R&D investment as well as new-product development and offerings.
Strengthened engine development and testing capability
In April 2018, the Company acquired the assets of Chicago Technical Center R&D facility from Ricardo, Inc. This transaction has allowed the Company to significantly strengthen and expand its testing capabilities and increase its capacity to meet current and future engine development, certification and durability testing needs. The advanced R&D facility immediately provides three strategic benefits for the corporate engine programs: (i) increased speed to market response, (ii) greater ability to innovate and optimize product performance and reliability, and (iii) lower cost of product development through direct control of in-house EPA and CARB-certified testing cell operations, scheduling and management of the industry-leading engine testing center.
Sales and Marketing
The Company employs a direct sales and marketing approach to maintain maximum interface with and service support for its OEM customers. This direct interface incorporates the corporate internal technical sales representatives. The Company complements its direct OEM relationships with a localized, independent sales and product support organization. This localized sales and support organization provides the necessary knowledge of local customs and requirements while also delivering immediate sales assistance and customer support.
The Company has invested in and is focused on capturing aftermarket sales of the value-added components that are included in its power systems. With a significant portion of the selling prices of the Company's power systems coming from value-added components, this is a large, continuing growth opportunity for its aftermarket business.
Customers
The Company's customers primarily include global OEMs and direct end users across a wide range of applications that demand high product quality, best-in-class engineering support and on-time delivery. Within several applications for which the Company provides solutions, it maintains supplier relationships with two or more customers, which are often among the largest in that category.
The Company's largest customers, based upon its consolidated net sales in 2017, included Hyster-Yale Materials Handling Group and Freightliner Trucks, a subsidiary of Daimler Trucks North America, which represented 16% and 10% of 2017 consolidated net sales, respectively. The largest customers change from time to time as a result of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, customers’ strategies and inventory of the Company's power systems.
Competition
In each of the Company's end markets there are a variety of competitors, including engine manufacturers, independent suppliers and distributors of engines, fuel systems providers, manufacturers of power generation equipment, engine packagers and integrators, and the in-house operations of certain OEMs, some of which have longer operating histories, strong brand recognition and significant financial and marketing resources. Although all of the Company's end markets and product offerings have several competitors, the Company believes that there is no single competitor with the same breadth of products, solutions and end markets. 
Notwithstanding significant competition, the Company believes that the following factors provide it with a differentiated value proposition that allows the Company to compete effectively:
•Fuel-agnostic strategy;
•Demonstrated expertise in on- and off-road applications;
•Ability to leverage Weichai's strengths and capabilities;
9

•Completeness and comprehensiveness of engines and power systems;
•Expansive product integrations, including electronics, controls, fuel systems and transmissions;
•Commonality of technology platform spanning all product lines;
•Emissions regulation compliance and certification;
•Breadth and depth of advanced engineering disciplines; 
•Industry-leading product and application engineering;
•Competitive pricing/cost;
•Ability to tailor power systems to specific customer needs;
•Performance and quality;
•Speed to market; and
•Customer support and service.
Manufacturing
The Company manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in suburban Chicago, Illinois, and Darien, Wisconsin, and customizes its power systems to meet specific requirements of OEM applications and the needs of its OEM customers. The Company has invested in precision machining equipment to finish its internally designed engine blocks, which are cast by various suppliers. The manufacturing lines in the Company's production facilities are technologically sophisticated and flexible, and the Company allocates production capacity on its manufacturing lines to accommodate the demand levels and product mix required by its OEM customers. 
The Company focuses on safety, quality and on-time delivery in its manufacturing operations. The Company is ISO 9001 2015 Certified, the highest ISO certification available. The ISO 9000 family of quality management standards, which must be met in order to become ISO certified, is designed to help organizations monitor and improve the quality and delivery of their products and/or services to their customers. The Company also uses tools such as Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, 80/20 and 5S strategies to help to manage its business, build quality, and drive performance and a continuous improvement culture within the manufacturing operations' teams. The Company also uses a customer relationship management database to help to collect customer feedback and to track overall quality performance at its OEM customers. Structured staff training is a constant priority and includes closed-loop quality monitoring and feedback systems.
Research, Development and Engineering
The Company’s research, development and engineering programs are focused on new product development, enhancements to current products, quality improvements and material cost reductions across its product lines. Its efforts are market driven, with the sales team identifying and defining market requirements and trends and its engineering and new-product development groups reviewing existing power system portfolios and developing new solutions that build upon the technology within that portfolio. 
The Company’s product and application development engineering teams include in-house mechanical and electrical engineering functions. Internal resources are supplemented with engineering outsourcing relationships for design, development and product testing. In addition to these engineering outsourcing relationships, the Company benefits from the design, development and testing capabilities of its supplier base. The Company staffs its engineering support activities associated with released product and component sourcing programs with dedicated internal engineering personnel.
Research, development and engineering expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, testing, information technology and administrative expenses and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. From time to time, the Company enters into agreements with its customers to fund a portion of the research, development and engineering costs of a particular project. These reimbursements are accounted for as a reduction of the related research, development and engineering expenditure. The Company's research, development and engineering expenditures for 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $19.9 million, $19.0 million, $23.6 million and $19.3 million, respectively.
Supplier Relationships
In addition to producing its own engines, the Company has established relationships with its suppliers for certain engines that are integrated into its comprehensive power systems, the most significant of which are Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Doosan Group, Shenyang Aerospace Mitsubishi Motors Engine Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (“SAME”), General Motors Company (“GM”) and Weichai. The Company also sources other power system components and coordinates design efforts with third-party suppliers for some of its key components. In general, the prices at which the Company purchases engines, components and other raw materials are based on market factors, including the prices offered by other suppliers operating in the same market and the prevailing market prices of raw materials. 
The Company aggregates product sourcing efforts across its large and diverse OEM customer base and across industry categories, capitalizing on volume, economies of scale and global supply opportunities. The Company's customers benefit from the aggregation of its global sourcing, procurement, and assembly and services, obtaining cost benefits that they might not obtain if they were to 
10

rely on their own internal resources, capabilities and more limited demand requirements. Through this process, customers are able to streamline their supply base by consolidating procurement and assembly efforts down to a single part number product supplied by the Company. The Company delivers this assembly to its customer’s production line ready to install into the customers' product.
Product Support
The Company's dedicated team of product and application engineers enables it to deliver high-quality, responsive technical support to its OEM and end-user customers. The Company provides technical support and training to its customers, including in-plant training and support through web- and phone-based field service. The Company further supports its customers by engaging regional providers to perform warranty services and offer support for its power systems. The Company also leverages its existing service and dealer network to provide service and support functions for its power systems sold to OEM customers on a case-by-case basis.
Backlog
Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Company's business.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, the Company's workforce consisted of approximately 1,000 full-time employees. None of the members of the Company's workforce are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Impact of Government Regulation
The Company’s power systems are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing exhaust emissions, evaporative emissions, greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and noise. The Company's power systems are subject to compliance with regulatory standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies in the United States, including the CARB, and other regulatory agencies around the world, such as the MEE. Since its engines are sold into both off-road and on-road markets, the Company must ensure certification to the specific regulations within the applicable statutory segment. For products sold into the U.S. market, both EPA and CARB have imposed specific regulations on engines used in both off-road equipment and on-road vehicles. These regulations generally serve to restrict exhaust emissions, with a primary focus on oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Exhaust emission regulations for engines used in off-highway industrial and power generation equipment vary based upon the use of the equipment into which the engine is incorporated (such as stationary power generation or mobile off-highway industrial equipment) and the type of fuel used to drive the power system. Similarly, on-road regulations from the EPA and CARB focus on the same exhaust constituents as well as sophisticated requirements to meet on-board diagnostic (“OBD”) system regulations. Emissions of GHGs such as carbon dioxide (“CO2”), methane and nitrogen dioxide (“NO2”) are also regulated, with more stringent regulatory requirements starting in 2021. The Company continues to make significant investments into the necessary intellectual property that supports full compliance of the Company's engines now and into the foreseeable future.
The first EPA emissions regulations adopted for diesel engines, known as Tier 1, applied to diesel engines used in mobile off-highway applications in the U.S., and similar standards for diesel engines, known as Stage I regulations, were implemented thereafter in the EU. The EPA and applicable agencies in the EU have continued to develop emissions regulations for diesel engines in the U.S. and the EU, respectively, and have adopted more restrictive standards. The current diesel engine emission requirements in the U.S are known as Tier 4 and are applicable to off-road diesel engines used in industrial equipment. Similarly, the EU has adopted more restrictive standards under its Stage V regulations. Tier 4 and Stage V regulations call for reductions in levels of particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen.
The Company’s entry into the transportation end market began in 2013 with the development of its 8.8L power systems targeted for 2015 regulatory standards. In 2014, the EPA and CARB certified the Company's new engine as a Model Year 2015 product for liquid propane gas (“LPG”) and compressed natural gas (“CNG”) fuels, and in 2015 the Company launched its first propane-fueled engine for on-road applications. To assist the adoption of alternative-fueled vehicles in the marketplace, the EPA and CARB granted alternative-fueled engines an exemption from OBD regulations until 2018 (CARB)/2019 (EPA). The Company has leveraged this exemption on its 8.8L certifications to date. Gasoline engines are not exempt from OBD regulations, therefore, in 2017, the Company achieved full OBD certification for its 2018 and beyond gasoline 6.0L and 8.8L products. The knowledge gained from this gasoline OBD development is being applied to the Company’s alternative-fueled engines for 2019 after all OBD exemptions end as of December 31, 2018. In 2016, the EPA launched new Phase 1 GHG emission regulations. Currently, the Company believes it is exempt from Phase 1 GHG regulations. Starting in 2021, new EPA Phase 2 GHG regulations will start and the Company’s engines will need to meet Phase 2 GHG standards.
The initial and ongoing certification requirements vary by power system application and market segment. Each application must undergo a series of rigorous and demanding tests to demonstrate compliance with regulatory standards, including useful life, zero hours and durability testing. Once a power system is certified, regulatory agencies impose ongoing compliance requirements, which include testing newly produced power systems on a regular quarterly schedule to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable regulations. In addition, there are field audit requirements, which require the removal of power systems from service at specified 
11

stages of their useful lives to perform confirmatory exhaust emissions testing and/or OBD system audits and testing. All of the Company’s emission-certified power systems meet existing exhaust emission standards of the EPA and CARB. Failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on the Company's future financial results.
