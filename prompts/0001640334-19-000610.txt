General Business Overview
 
We market and distribute skin care products manufactured by A.C. (USA), Inc. (“A.C.”), which is headquartered in the City of Industry, California and has offices in Taiwan. We market and distribute A.C. skin care products to resellers who will recognize the needs of their targeted customers in various regions in Asia, such as People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), Singapore and Malaysia. We acquire the products from A.C.’s Taiwan warehouses. Our strategy is to target spas, department stores and specialty stores that sell similar skin products. As of the date of this annual report, we have sold the A.C. Products to local distributors and specialty stores. 
 
The skin care products that we will distribute are designed to address various skin care needs. Those products include moisturizers, serums, cleansers, toners, body care, exfoliators, acne and oil correctors, facial masks, cleansing devices and sun care products. A number of those products are developed for use on particular areas of the body, such as the face or hands or around the eyes.
 
We believe the Company, together with its subsidiaries, distributes highly innovative personal care products and ecologically friendly cleaning products in Taiwan and plans to expand its distribution to China, Malaysia, and Thailand. Emperor Star’s product line includes anti-aging products that address the key signs of aging to reinvigorate and provide youthful energy and nutrition supplements. The Company stopped the line of ecologically friendly cleaning products in 2018. 
 
In April 2018, we, through Emperor Star, started purchasing a type of water purifying machines from Cosminergy Hitech Development Co., Ltd. (“Cosminergy”) and reselling such water purifying machines in certain Asian countries and regions.
 
In addition, we provided inventory, membership and business management software that designed by CKS Information Co., Ltd. to our customers in the fiscal year of 2018.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Distribution Agreement, we market and promote the A.C. Products as defined therein in the Territory as amended to include PRC, Singapore and Malaysia in addition to Taiwan. Accordingly, we are the exclusive distributor for those A.C. Products in the above Territories.
 
On April 30, 2018, we, through our Emperor Star, entered into a distribution agreement (the “Cosminergy Distribution Agreement”) with Cosminergy Hitech Development Co., Ltd. (Cosminergy”) pursuant to which we started purchasing a type of water purifying machines from Cosminergy and reselling the water purifying machines in certain Asian areas and countries. The term of the said distribution agreement shall expire on April 30, 2019.

Cosminergy Water Purifying Machines

The Cosminergy water purifying machines contain anion ceramic and silicon ceramic which can remove from water particles, sediments, chemical contaminants, like heavy metals and hydrogen sulfide to purify water. We believe the Cosminergy water purifying machines will be popular in the areas where the water quality is relatively poor. We believe the Cosminergy water purifying machines can effectively kill and stop the reproduction of bacteria in the water.
Marketing and Distribution
 We believe our market is retailers who recognize the needs of the targeted consumers. Our strategy is to target spas, department stores and specialty stores that sell similar skin care products. We hope that our product positioning will assist in the marketing and distribution of those skin care products. We anticipate that we will reach our targeted reseller market by the following types of resellers: 
 Spas and Health Clubs – Most high quality day spas and health clubs (and many upscale spas at resort properties) use generic products. Our goal will be to develop affiliations with select spas in urban areas and vacation destinations to whom we will market and sell those skin care products.

Lifestyle Retailers – We anticipate that the skin care products will be lifestyle-based rather than the typical soaps and potions of natural product retailers. These retailers exist in almost every city and have developed loyal and sophisticated customer bases.

 
Additionally, we anticipate that we will market those skin care products to cosmetic specialty retailers and boutique department stores.
 
We believe that the targeted in users of those skin care products are between the ages of 20 and 65 and are predominantly female. We believe they are urban professionals with at least some college level education. The targeted users have active lifestyles and are concerned about social and environmental issues. Mind and body wellness are important to them. They belong to a health club; take yoga, pilates or taichi lessons. The maintenance of a youthful appearance are a part of their life.

Cosminergy Water Purifying Machines
 
In 2018, we mainly distributed the Cosminergy water purifying machines in PRC (including Hong Kong), Taiwan and Singapore through retailers in those regions and countries.
 
Competition
 
The skin care business is characterized by vigorous competition throughout the world. Brand recognition, quality, performance, availability and price are some of the factors that impact consumers’ choices among competing products and brands. Advertising, promotion, merchandising, the pace and timing of new product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store demonstrations also have a significant impact on consumers’ buying decisions. We compete against a number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do.
 
Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of skin care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names. They include, among others, L’Oreal S.A., Shiseido Company, Ltd., Beiersdorf AG, LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton, Coty, Inc., The Procter & Gamble Company, Avon Products, Inc., Chanel S.A., and Clarins Group. We also face competition from a number of independent brands, as well as some retailers that have developed their own skin care brands. Certain of our competitors may also have ownership interests in retailers that are customers of ours. 
 
With respect to the water purifiers, we face competition from a large number of water purifiers with similar functions. A lot of the competitors in this industry, such as Dyson and Berkey Filters, may have established brands, broad distribution network and sufficient financial resources. 
 
Patents and Trademarks  
At the present we do not have any patents or trademarks.
 
Need for any Government Approval
 
There is no approval required for the marketing and distribution of those A.C. Products in Taiwan; provided, however, pursuant to the Statute for the Control of Cosmetic Hygiene promulgated by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan, we are required to file an application with the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan for reference purposes.
 
We have been informed by appropriate representatives of A.C. that the skin care products we plan to market and distribute pursuant to the Distribution Agreement are classified as cosmetics not containing any medical, poisonous or potent drugs under the Republic of China Statute for Control of Cosmetic Hygiene. Accordingly, those products are not necessarily subject to any inspection to obtain approval for their sales. The labeling of those packages clearly indicate in Chinese the name and address of the manufacturer, the name of the product, the ingredients, the usage and directions, the weight, the manufacturing date, the expiration date, the name and address of the importer. We were informed by those representatives that those skin care products are, currently, appropriate for marketing and distribution in Taiwan. In the year of 2018, the Customs of Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore approved the imports of the A.C. Products that we brought to the three regions and countries. We were in the process of preparing additional documents for the Customs of the PRC with respect to the imports of the A.C. Products. 
 
Environmental Laws
 
Our operations focused on sales and distribution and therefore are not subject to any environmental laws.

12 Month Growth Strategy
 
Our goal is to maximize shareholder value. To achieve that goal, we intend to expand our operations and evaluate and cultivate new and alternative revenue generating opportunities. We are committed to marketing and distributing skin care products. While strategic and wisely executed marketing campaigns are key to expanding our operations; offering innovative skin care products should position us in the best possible way for long term success.
