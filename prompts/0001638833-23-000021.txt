Item 1. Business
Overview
Surgery Partners, Inc., a Delaware corporation, acting through its subsidiaries, owns and operates a national network of surgical facilities and ancillary services. Unless the context otherwise indicates, Surgery Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries are referred to herein as "Surgery Partners," "we," "us," "our" or the "Company."
As of December 31, 2022, we owned or operated primarily in partnership with physicians, a portfolio of 146 surgical facilities in the United States ("U.S.") comprised of 127 ambulatory surgical centers ("ASCs") and 19 surgical hospitals ("surgical hospitals," and together with ASCs, referred to in this report as "surgical facilities" or "facilities") across 31 states, including a majority interest in 93 of the surgical facilities. During 2022, patient services provided in our surgical facilities generated approximately $2.4 billion in revenue. 
Our Growth Strategies
Our differentiated operating model employs a multifaceted strategy to grow revenue, earnings and cash flow. We believe the following are key components to this strategy:
•Deliver outstanding patient care and clinical outcomes;
•Continue to execute and expand upon our physician engagement strategy in attractive markets;
•Become the partner of choice for physicians seeking to become or stay independent;
•Become the employer of choice by attracting, engaging, retaining, developing and promoting talent;
•Drive organic growth at existing facilities through targeted physician recruitment, service line expansion and implementing our efficient operating model;
•Seek partnership opportunities with payors to make health care more affordable for their members;
•Seek partnership opportunities with health systems looking to develop and/or enhance their ambulatory surgery footprint to better meet the needs of the patients and medical staff;
•Continue our disciplined acquisition strategy;
•Offer new services to provide a more comprehensive continuum of care; and
•Enhance operational efficiencies and productivity by delivering on integration.
In addition, we believe favorable industry trends such as an aging population and advancements in medical technology will further drive growth.
Total Addressable Market
Based on management estimates, we believe that the total U.S. outpatient surgical facility market represents approximately $90 billion in annual revenue, including approximately $55 billion of hospital outpatient department procedures and $35 billion of ambulatory surgical center procedures, and we believe that ASCs are capturing an increasing share of the total surgical procedure market. We estimate that as a result of this trend, total annual procedure volume is expected to grow over the next few years by approximately 2% in hospital outpatient departments and by approximately 6% in ASCs, while inpatient procedures will decline by approximately 2% during the same period. In addition, we believe that approximately $60 billion of inpatient surgical cases have the potential to move to outpatient surgery centers, which, together with procedures performed at hospital outpatient departments and ASCs, represents what we believe is a total addressable market of approximately $150 billion. 
Patient and Physician Satisfaction
We are leveraging our growth strategies to capture market share by providing high quality service. According to a survey of health and life safety tags, our ASCs averaged 25% fewer deficiencies compared with the total market, with 6.3 deficiencies at our ASCs compared to 8.4 in other ASCs. Similarly, our surgical hospitals averaged 48% fewer deficiencies per survey compared to all other hospitals surveyed, with 17.6 deficiencies for our surgical hospitals compared with 33.7 deficiencies at other hospitals according to an industry survey. In addition, 94% of our surgical hospitals were rated four to five stars in the CMS star rating. This has resulted in an overall patient experience score of 95, based on patient satisfaction surveys conducted from May 2022 to July 2022. 
Impact of COVID-19
The public health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly affected our facilities, employees, patients, communities, business operations and financial performance, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our surgical facilities varies based on the market in which the facility operates, the type of surgical facility and the procedures typically performed. We cannot provide any certainty regarding the length and severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is difficult to predict and is dependent on factors beyond our control.
Taking into account the pandemic and other factors, the United States economy has recently experienced general inflationary pressures, significant disruptions to global supply networks, and an extremely competitive labor market. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, certain increased expenses arising from the pandemic and these economic conditions, including additional labor, supply chain, capital and other expenditures. While we have implemented cost containment and other measures to try to counteract these developments, we may be unable to fully offset these increases in our costs and otherwise effectively respond to supply disruptions.
The Company is monitoring legislative actions at federal and state levels, including the impact of the CARES Act and other governmental programs related to the COVID-19 public health emergency. On January 30, 2023, the Biden Administration announced its intent to end the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration effective as of the end of the day on May 11, 2023. As a result of the expiration of the public health emergency, many Medicare and Medicaid waivers and broad flexibilities deemed necessary to expand healthcare system capacity and to allow the health care system to weather the heightened strain created by COVID-19 will come to an end.
Operations
During 2022 and 2021, we operated in two reporting segments: Surgical Facility Services and Ancillary Services. Prior to 2021, we also operated in the Optical Services reporting segment. 
•Our Surgical Facility Services segment consisted of the operation of ASCs and surgical hospitals and includes our anesthesia services. Our surgical facilities primarily provide non-emergency surgical procedures across many specialties, including, among others, orthopedics and pain management, ophthalmology, gastroenterology ("GI") and general surgery.
•Our Ancillary Services segment consisted of multi-specialty physician practices, including physician practices owned and operated pursuant to long-term management service agreements, and prior to 2021, a diagnostic laboratory, which was closed during the third quarter of 2020.
•Our Optical Services segment consisted of an optical products group purchasing organization, which was divested on December 31, 2020. Our Optical Services segment was not a material component of our total revenue, contributing less than 1% in 2020.
Surgical Facility Services Segment
Surgical Facility Operations
As of December 31, 2022, we owned or operated primarily in partnership with physicians, 146 surgical facilities, including 127 ASCs and 19 licensed surgical hospitals. Our surgical facilities generally are located in close proximity to physicians’ offices. Our Surgical Facility Services segment contributed approximately 97% of our total revenue in each of 2022 and 2021, and 96% of our total revenue in 2020. 
Our typical ASC is a free-standing facility that performs planned surgical procedures on an outpatient basis for patients not requiring hospitalization and for whom an overnight stay is not expected after surgery. Each ASC usually has one to seven operating or procedure rooms with areas for reception, pre-operative care, recovery and administration. The staff of our ASCs generally includes a center administrator, registered nurses, operating room technicians, as well as other administrative staff.
Our surgical hospitals generally are larger than our ASCs and include inpatient hospital rooms and, in certain cases, emergency departments. Our surgical hospitals also provide services such as diagnostic imaging, laboratory, obstetrics, oncology, pharmacy, physical therapy and wound care.
We operate both multi-specialty and single-specialty facilities. In multi-specialty facilities, a variety of surgical procedures are performed, including, among others, orthopedics and pain management, ophthalmology, GI and general surgery. We have diversified the mix of procedures performed at our facilities by strategically introducing select specialties that will complement existing services. In many cases, we keep certain facilities as single-specialty where it suits an individual facility or market demand.
We provide each of our surgical facilities with a full range of financial, marketing and operating services. For example, our regional managed care directors assist the local management team at each of our surgical facilities in developing relationships with private insurance payors and negotiating private insurance contracts. 
Surgical Facility Ownership Structure
We own and operate our surgical facilities through partnerships or limited liability companies with physicians, physician groups and health care systems. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries typically serves as the general partner or managing member of our surgical facilities. We generally seek to own a majority interest in our surgical facilities or otherwise have sufficient control over the facilities in order to consolidate the financial results. In some instances, we acquire ownership in a surgical facility with the prior owners retaining ownership, and, in some cases, we offer new ownership to other physicians or health care systems. We hold majority ownership in 93 surgical facilities in which we own an interest. We provide intercompany loans to some of the surgical facilities which often are secured by a pledge of assets of the facility. We also provide day-to-day management services for a majority of our surgical facilities pursuant to a management agreement and receive a management fee that is typically equal to a percentage of the facility revenue.
Strategic Relationships
When attractive opportunities arise, we may develop, acquire or operate surgical facilities through strategic relationships with payors, health care systems, and other health care providers. We believe that forming such strategic relationships can enhance our ability to attract physicians and access favorable private insurance contracts for our surgical facilities in that market.  
The strategic relationships through which we own and operate surgical facilities are governed by partnership and operating agreements that generally are comparable to the partnership and operating agreements of the other surgical facilities in which we own an interest. The primary difference between the structure of these strategic relationships and the other surgical facilities in which we hold ownership is that, in these strategic relationships, a health care system holds ownership in the surgical facility in addition to physician investors. In each of these strategic relationships, we also have entered into a management agreement under which we provide day-to-day management services for a management fee equal to a percentage of the revenues of the surgical facility. The terms of those management agreements are comparable to the terms of our management agreements with other surgical facilities in which we own an interest.
Sources of Revenue
Revenue from our surgical facilities is earned from facility fees related to health care services performed in our surgical facilities and is included in our patient service revenues. The fee charged for surgical services varies depending on the type of service provided, but usually includes all charges for usage of an operating room, a recovery room, special equipment, supplies, nursing staff and/or medications. Our fees do not typically include professional fees charged by the patient's surgeon, anesthesiologist or other attending physician, which are billed directly by such physicians.
We are dependent upon government and private insurance sources of payment for the services we provide. The amounts that our surgical facilities receive in payment for their services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors as well as other factors over which we have no control, including Medicare, Medicaid and state regulations, cost containment and utilization decisions and reduced reimbursement schedules of private insurance payors.
The following table sets forth the percentage of total patient service revenues for our consolidated surgical facilities by type of payor for the periods indicated:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Private Insurance | 51.5 | % | | 50.6 | % | 53.9 | %
Government | 42.3 | % | | 43.3 | % | 38.6 | %
Self-pay | 2.6 | % | | 2.8 | % | 3.2 | %
Other | 3.6 | % | | 3.3 | % | 4.3 | %
Total patient service revenues | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

We receive reimbursement from Medicare for surgical services based on three different payment systems depending on the site of service: hospital inpatient surgical services, hospital outpatient surgical services and outpatient surgical services generally provided in our ASCs. 
Medicare Reimbursement - Hospital Inpatient Services
Nineteen of our surgical facilities are licensed as hospitals. Most inpatient services provided by hospitals are reimbursed by Medicare under the inpatient prospective payment system ("IPPS"). Under the IPPS, a hospital receives a fixed amount for inpatient hospital services based on each patient's final assigned Medicare-severity diagnosis related group ("MS-DRG"). Each MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate that is prospectively set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") using national average resources used per case for treating a patient with a particular diagnosis. This assignment also affects the prospectively determined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. MS-DRG and capital payments are adjusted by a predetermined geographic adjustment factor assigned to the geographic area in which the hospital is located. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the "hospital market basket index," gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services.
On August 10, 2022, CMS published the IPPS final rule for federal fiscal year ("FFY") 2023, which began on October 1, 2021. Under the FFY 2022 final rule, rates for inpatient stays in hospitals paid under the IPPS that successfully report certain quality data under the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting ("IQR") Program and demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record ("EHR") technology will be increased by 4.3%. Those hospitals that do not successfully report quality data under the IQR Program (but are meaningful EHR users) would be subject to a one-fourth reduction in their annual payment update. In addition to the IQR Program, hospitals will be subject to payment adjustments under the Value Based Purchasing Program, Readmissions Reduction Program and Hospital Acquired Conditions Reduction Programs that have been implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS").
Medicare Reimbursement - Hospital Outpatient Departments
Surgical services that are provided in hospital outpatient departments ("HOPDs") generally are reimbursed by CMS using the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (the "OPPS"). The OPPS, established by the Secretary of HHS, determines payment amounts prospectively (generally the following calendar year) for various categories of medical services performed in HOPDs. On November 1, 2022, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2023. The final rule provides for a payment rate increase of 3.8%. Hospitals that do not meet the reporting requirements of the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting Program will be subject to a 2.0% payment rate decrease. On November 1, 2022, CMS additionally released final updates to its Medicare Part B drug payment policy for hospitals participating in the 340B drug pricing program. The policy change was included in the OPPS final rule, which outlines the 2023 OPPS payment rates. Under the new policy, Medicare will pay lower rates to all OPPS participating HOPDs for non-drug services.
As a result of legislative changes related to off-campus HOPDs, certain off-campus HOPDs that began billing under the OPPS (or underwent certain changes) on or after November 2, 2015 are no longer paid for most services under the OPPS. Instead, these facilities are paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule ("MPFS"), which typically results in lower reimbursements. Services provided in a dedicated emergency department are still paid under the OPPS. This change has not significantly affected reimbursement to any of our HOPDs, but we cannot assure you that our HOPDs will not be impacted in the future.
Medicare Reimbursement - ASCs
    Payments under the Medicare program to ASCs are also made based on the OPPS; however, the payment received from CMS is a percentage of the payment to HOPDs. Reimbursement rates for ASCs are updated annually based on changes in the consumer price index offset by multifactor productivity adjustments. Based on the OPPS Final Rule, ASC reimbursement rates will increase by 3.8% for 2023. CMS has established the Ambulatory Surgical Center for Quality Reporting ("ASCQR") Program as a pay-for-reporting, quality data program. Our ASCs that participate in the ASCQR Program receive the full annual update to the ASC payment rate. Those ASCs that do not successfully report quality data under the ASCQR Program may receive a payment reduction.
Annual Cost Reports
Hospitals participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a prospective payment system, may be required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require submission of annual cost reports identifying medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine governmental audits. These audits may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be payable to us under these reimbursement programs. Finalization of these audits often takes several years. Providers may appeal any final determination made in connection with an audit. While ASCs are not currently subject to federal cost reporting requirements, it is possible that such requirements, which could be costly for us, will be implemented by CMS in the future.
Ancillary Services Segment
Ancillary Services
Our portfolio of outpatient surgical facilities is complemented by a suite of ancillary services that we provide to support physicians in providing high quality and cost-efficient patient care. This segment includes multi-specialty physician practices, urgent care facilities and anesthesia services. The Company, physicians and patients benefit from these services through improved clinical efficiency and scheduling, and from incremental revenue associated with retaining fees for these services. Our Ancillary Services segment contributed approximately 3% of our total revenue in each of 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
We employ two models in our network of multi-specialty physician practices. In one model, we wholly own and operate physician practices. For example, in the state of Florida, where the law does not preclude a business corporation from employing physicians, we wholly-own and operate physician practices in several locations throughout Florida. In the other model, we operate physician practices pursuant to long-term management service agreements with separate professional corporations that are wholly-owned by physicians.
Until it was closed in the third quarter of 2020, we offered physicians toxicology testing services through our wholly-owned diagnostic laboratory based in Tampa, Florida. 
Sources of Revenue - Ancillary Services Segment
The fees charged for services in our Ancillary Services segment depend on a variety of factors, including the type of service provided, the location in which the service is provided and the provider of the service. Service fees are received from both government and private insurance payors. The amounts that we receive in payment for the provision of ancillary services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors as well as other factors over which we have no control, including Medicare, Medicaid and state regulations, cost containment and utilization decisions and reduced reimbursement schedules of private insurance payors. 
Acquisition and Development Programs
Acquisition Program. In addition to our corporate strategy, we continuously evaluate opportunities to expand our presence in the surgical facility market by making strategic acquisitions of existing surgical facilities and by developing new surgical facilities in cooperation with local physician partners and, when appropriate, health care systems and other strategic partners. We generally structure our partnerships where either we are a majority owner partnered with physicians or we are a minority owner with buy-up rights. These buy-
up rights give us the option to own a controlling interest at some point in the future. Alternatively, we may choose to pursue a strategic relationship with physicians and a health care system.
We employ a dedicated acquisition team with experience in health care services. Our team seeks to acquire surgical facilities that meet our criteria, including prominence and quality of physician partners, specialty mix, opportunities for growth, level of competition in the local market, level of private insurance penetration and our ability to access private insurance contracts. We carefully evaluate each of our acquisition opportunities through an extensive due diligence process to determine which facilities have the greatest potential for growth and profitability improvements under our operating structure. Our team may also identify opportunities to attract additional physicians to increase the acquired facility’s revenues and profitability.  
Development Program. We develop surgical facilities in markets that we identify as having substantial interest by physicians and payors. We have experience in developing both single and multi-specialty surgical facilities. When we develop a new surgical facility, we generally provide all of the services necessary to complete the project. We offer in-house capabilities for structuring partnerships and financing facilities and work with architects and construction firms in the design and development of surgical facilities. Before and during the development phase of a new surgical facility, we analyze the competitive environment in the local market, review market data to identify appropriate services to provide, prepare and analyze financial forecasts, evaluate regulatory and licensing issues and assist in designing the surgical facility and identifying appropriate equipment to purchase or lease. After a surgical facility is developed, we typically provide general startup operational support, including information systems, equipment procurement and financing.  
Marketing
We primarily direct our sales and marketing efforts at physicians who would utilize our surgical facilities. Marketing activities directed at physicians and other health care providers are coordinated locally by the individual surgical facility and are supplemented by dedicated corporate personnel. These activities generally emphasize the benefits offered by our surgical facilities compared to other facilities in the market, such as the proximity of our surgical facilities to physicians’ offices, the ability to schedule consecutive cases without preemption by inpatient or emergency procedures, the efficient turnaround time between cases, our advanced surgical equipment and our simplified administrative procedures. Although the facility administrator is the primary point of contact, physicians who utilize our surgical facilities are important sources of recommendations to other physicians regarding the benefits of using our surgical facilities. Recruiting teams develop a target list of physicians, and we continually review our progress in successfully recruiting additional local physicians.
We also market our surgical facilities directly to private insurance payors. Payor marketing activities conducted by our corporate office management and facility administrators emphasize the high quality of care, cost advantages and convenience of our surgical facilities, and are focused on making each surgical facility an approved provider under local managed care plans.
Competition
In each market in which we operate a surgical facility, we compete with hospitals and operators of other surgical facilities to attract physicians and patients. We believe that the competitive factors that affect our surgical facilities’ ability to compete for physicians are convenience of location of the surgical facilities, quality of care offered, convenience of scheduling, professionalism and cleanliness of facilities, access to capital and participation in private insurance programs. In addition, we believe our national prominence, scale and reputation are instrumental in attracting physicians. We believe that our surgical facilities attract patients based upon our quality of care, the specialties and reputations of the physicians who operate in our surgical facilities, participation in managed care programs, ease of access and convenient scheduling and registration procedures.
In developing or acquiring existing surgical facilities, we compete with other public and private surgical facility and hospital companies. Several large national companies own and/or manage surgical facilities, in some cases in connection with other lines of business with which we do not compete, including HCA Healthcare, Inc., Envision Healthcare Corporation, Tenet Healthcare Corporation, Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc. and Optum, Inc. We also face competition from local hospitals, physicians and other providers who may compete with us in the ownership and operation of surgical facilities, as well as the trend of physicians choosing to perform procedures in an office-based setting rather than in a surgical facility.
Seasonality 
Our revenue fluctuates based on the number of business days in each calendar quarter, because the majority of services provided by physicians in our surgical facilities consist of scheduled procedures and office visits that occur during business hours. In addition, revenue in the fourth quarter could also be impacted by an increased utilization of services due to annual deductibles which are not usually met until later in the year and also as patients utilize their health care benefits before they expire at year-end.
Human Capital Resources
At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 12,200 employees, including approximately 3,100 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Our mission is to enhance patient quality of life through partnership. We appreciate that our colleagues are key to creating value and believe that we have a good relationship with them. We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. 
We have established, and continue to enhance and refine, a comprehensive set of practices for engaging, recruiting, developing, managing and optimizing the human resources of our organization. In general, we seek to attract, develop and retain an engaged workforce and improve talent management processes accordingly. We offer a competitive range of compensation and benefit programs. We also are committed to the health and safety of our patients, employees, and medical staff, including the implementation of additional safety measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and CMS COVID Vaccination Regulations. Our code of conduct promotes integrity, accountability and transparency, among other high ethical standards and a focus on employee welfare.
Our surgical facilities are staffed by licensed physicians. We generally do not enter into contracts with physicians who use our surgical facilities, other than partnership and operating agreements with physicians who own interests in our surgical facilities, agreements for anesthesiology services and medical director agreements. Most physicians are not employees of our surgical facilities and are not contractually required to use our facilities. Physicians who use our surgical facilities also use other facilities or hospitals and may choose to perform procedures in an office-based setting that might otherwise be performed at our surgical facilities. Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our physicians and clinical personnel. We compete with other health care providers, primarily hospitals and other surgical facilities, in attracting physicians to utilize our surgical facilities, nurses and medical staff to support our surgical facilities, recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our facilities.
Our surgical facilities, like most healthcare providers, have experienced rising labor costs. In several markets, nurse and medical support personnel availability has become a significant operating issue to healthcare providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve engagement, retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity. We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could continue to increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate.
We believe that our employees are vital contributors to our success, and we devote significant resources to recruit and retain our workforce. We strive to recruit and retain a diverse population of employees at all stages of their careers that are reflective of the communities we serve. We are committed to promoting an inclusive culture through diversity of thoughts and backgrounds, recognizing the value these experiences bring to our colleagues, physicians, patients and the communities in which we reside. One of our core values is to promote a culture of diversity and inclusion. We have a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Community Impact Council comprised of employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences or characteristics who share a common interest in improving corporate culture and delivering sustained business results. Our policies prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, color, national or ethnic origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, military service, pregnancy, physical or mental disabilities, genetic information, or any other class protected by applicable law in its administration of policies, programs or employment.
Environmental
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. Our operations include the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials. We may, in the future, incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to contamination of sites we own or operate (including contamination caused by prior owners or operators of such sites, adjoining properties or other persons) and the off-site disposal of hazardous substances. We believe that we have been and are in substantial compliance with the terms of all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that we have no liabilities under environmental requirements that we would expect to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition (including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position).
Insurance
We maintain liability insurance in amounts that we believe are appropriate for our operations. Currently, we maintain professional, general and workers' compensation liability insurance in excess of self-insured retentions through third party commercial insurance carriers. We also maintain cyber insurance, business interruption insurance and property damage insurance. Coverage under certain of these policies is contingent upon the policy being in effect when a claim is made regardless of when the events which caused the claim occurred.
In addition, physicians who provide professional services in our surgical facilities are required to maintain separate malpractice coverage with defined minimum coverage limits. While we believe that our insurance policies are adequate in amount and coverage for our operations, we make no assurances that the insurance coverage is sufficient to cover all future claims or will continue to be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost.
Private Insurance Payors
Most private third-party payors reimburse us for services pursuant to written contracts. These contracts generally require that we offer discounts from our established charges. Some of our payments come from private insurance payors with which we do not have written contracts. In those situations, commonly known as "out-of-network" services, we generally charge the patients the same co-payment or other patient responsibility amounts that we would have charged had we had a contract with the private insurance payor. We also submit a claim for the services to the private insurance payor along with full disclosure that we have charged the patient an in-network patient responsibility amount.
Governmental Regulation
General
We are subject to federal, state and local laws dealing with issues such as occupational safety, employment, medical leave, insurance regulations, civil rights, discrimination, building codes and medical waste and other environmental issues. Federal, state and local governments are expanding the regulatory requirements on businesses like ours. The imposition of these regulatory requirements may have the effect of increasing operating costs and reducing the profitability of our operations. 
Regulatory Development in Response to COVID-19
Numerous legislative and regulatory actions were taken in an attempt to provide businesses, including health care providers, with relief from the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The legislative and regulatory responses to the COVID-19 pandemic generally impact many of the statutes, regulations and policies summarized or discussed throughout this Annual Report.
CARES Act and Other Stimulus Legislation
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") was signed into law on March 27, 2020. Among other things, the CARES Act contains a number of provisions that are intended to assist health care providers as they combat the effects of the COVID-19 public health emergency. The healthcare-specific provisions include:
•the temporary suspension of Medicare sequestration, which began May 1, 2020 and ultimately was extended to April 1, 2022. The sequestration adjustment was phased back in with a 1% reduction beginning April 1, 2022, and returned to 2% on July 1, 2022.
•an appropriation of $100 billion to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund for a new program to reimburse, through grants or other mechanisms, eligible health care providers and other approved entities for COVID-19-related expenses or lost revenues;
•the expansion of CMS’ Accelerated and Advance Payment Program; and
•waivers or temporary suspension of certain regulatory requirements.
On December 27, 2020, the COVID-19 Economic Relief Bill (the "Bill") was enacted, which among other significant matters, revised previous guidance on how grant funds distributed under the CARES Act may be utilized. These changes included greater clarity on the measurement of lost revenues eligible to be claimed against grant funds received through the CARES Act as well as how funds can be allocated among consolidated facilities.
The underlying terms and conditions of grant funds received through the CARES Act, the Bill and other governmental assistance programs, including auditing and reporting requirements, was initially subject to changing and evolving interpretation by HHS. Additional guidance or new and amended interpretations of existing guidance on the terms and conditions of such payments may result in our inability to recognize certain payments, changes in the estimate of amounts recognized, or the derecognition of amounts previously recognized. Such changes may be material. 
For more information, please refer to Note 1. "Organization and Summary of Accounting Policies - Medicare Accelerated Payments and Deferred Government Grants" to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 included elsewhere herein.
Waivers or Temporary Suspension of Certain Regulatory Requirements
In addition to the financial and other relief that has been provided by the federal government through the CARES Act and other legislation that has been passed by Congress, CMS and many state governments have also issued a number of waivers and temporary suspensions of health care facility licensure, certification, and reimbursement requirements in order to provide hospitals, ASCs, physicians, and other health care providers with increased flexibility to meet the challenges presented by the COVID-19 public health emergency. Many states have also suspended the enforcement of certain regulatory requirements to ensure that health care providers have sufficient capacity to treat COVID-19 patients. These regulatory changes are temporary, and we anticipate substantially all requirements will be reinstated in all material respects at the conclusion of the public health emergency. 
Anticipated Expiration of Public Health Emergency
On January 30, 2023, the Biden Administration announced its intent to end the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration effective as of the end of the day on May 11, 2023. As a result of the expiration of the public health emergency, many Medicare and Medicaid waivers and broad flexibilities deemed necessary to expand healthcare system capacity and to allow the health care system to weather the heightened strain created by COVID-19 will come to an end. We continue to closely monitor legislative actions and regulatory guidance at the federal, state and local levels with respect to the CARES Act and other governmental programs related to the COVID-19 public health emergency.
Certificates of Need, Licensure and Accreditation
Capital expenditures for the construction of new health care facilities, the addition of beds or new health care services or the acquisition of existing health care facilities may be reviewable by state regulators under statutory programs that are sometimes referred to as certificate of need laws. States with certificate of need laws place limits on the construction and acquisition of health care facilities and the expansion of existing facilities and services. In these states, approvals, generally known as certificates of need, are required for capital expenditures exceeding certain preset monetary thresholds for the development, acquisition and/or expansion of certain facilities or services, including, in certain of these states, surgical facilities. Certificate of need laws are being challenged in many states across the country and any future changes could have positive and negative impacts on our business. We currently operate in 21 states that have certificate of need laws. 
Our surgical facilities also are subject to state licensing requirements for medical providers. Our ASCs have licenses to operate as required in the states in which they operate and must meet all applicable requirements for ASCs. In addition, even though our surgical facilities that are licensed as hospitals primarily provide surgical services, they must meet all applicable requirements for general hospital licensure. To assure continued compliance with these regulations, governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our surgical facilities. The failure to comply with these regulations could result in the suspension or revocation of a facility’s license. In addition, based on the specific operations of our surgical facilities, some of these facilities maintain a pharmacy license, a controlled substance registration, a clinical laboratory certification waiver, and environmental protection permits for biohazards and/or radioactive materials, as required by applicable law.
As of December 31, 2022, the majority of our facilities were accredited by either The Joint Commission or the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, two of the major national organizations that establish standards relating to the physical plant, administration, quality of patient care and operation of medical staffs of various types of health care facilities. The effect of accreditation by these organizations is to exempt the facilities from routine surveys by state agencies to determine compliance with CMS requirements. These accredited facilities are subject to periodic surveys by the accrediting organization to ensure that they are in compliance with the applicable standards. Many private insurance health plans require our facilities to be accredited by one or both of these organizations in order to be participating providers. Failure to maintain accreditation would cause a facility to become subject to state survey agency oversight and potentially subject to increased scrutiny by CMS, and could result in a loss of payment from private insurance health plans.
Executive Order
On July 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that is intended to promote competition in the U.S. economy. Among other things, the executive order encourages the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") to ban or limit non-compete agreements, encourages the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the FTC to review and revise their merger guidelines to ensure that patients are not harmed by healthcare mergers, and instructs HHS to support existing price transparency rules and implement the legislation that was recently adopted to address surprise billing. We cannot predict how, if at all, the various initiatives set forth in the executive order will be implemented by the regulatory agencies involved or the impact that the executive order will have on operations. For example, the FTC recently published a proposed rule that would prohibit employers from entering into non-compete agreements and nullify existing non-competes.
Affordable Care Act Repeal Efforts 
Initiatives to repeal or modify the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Affordable Care Act") have been persistent over the past several years. As of December 31, 2022, legislative efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in full have not been successful. However, as a result of the enactment of the Tax and Jobs Act of 2017, the tax penalty associated with the so-called "individual mandate," which requires most individuals to obtain qualifying health insurance coverage or pay a tax penalty, was reduced to zero starting in 2019. The effective repeal of the individual mandate tax penalty and any other future repeal or replacement of the Affordable Care Act may have significant impact on the reimbursement for health care services generally, and may cause more individuals to become uninsured, rendering them unable to afford our health care services. In 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a case that sought to invalidate the Affordable Care Act; however, the Affordable Care Act remains subject to various challenges. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the adoption of any future federal or state health care reform legislation, or any ruling by a court with respect to the Affordable Care Act, will not have a negative financial impact on the Company.
Medicare and Medicaid Private Contractor Audits 
CMS has implemented a number of programs that use private contractors that contract with CMS to identify overpayments and underpayments and other potential sources of billing fraud. These contractors, known as Recovery Audit Contractors ("RACs") and Zone Program Integrity Contractors ("ZPICs") conduct both post-payment and pre-payment review of claims submitted by Medicare providers. In addition, CMS employs Medicaid Integrity Contractors ("MICs") to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. Our facilities and providers periodically receive letters from auditors such as RACs and ZPICs requesting repayment of alleged overpayments for services and incur expenses associated with responding to and appealing these determinations, as well as the costs of repaying any overpayments. Moreover, in recent years, the increase in Medicare payment appeals has created a backlog such that resolving appeals often takes multiple years. 
Although all other repayments requested to date as a result of RAC, MIC and ZPIC audits have not been material to our Company, we are unable to quantify the aggregate financial impact of these audits on our facilities given the pending appeals and uncertainty about the extent of future audits. 
Medicare and Medicaid Participation 
The majority of our revenue is expected to continue to be received from third-party payors, including federal and state programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private insurance payors. To participate in the Medicare program and receive Medicare payment, our surgical facilities must comply with regulations promulgated by HHS. Among other things, these regulations, known as "conditions for coverage" or "conditions of participation," impose numerous requirements on our facilities, their equipment, their personnel and their standards of medical care, as well as compliance with all applicable state and local laws and regulations. In 2007, CMS issued a policy memorandum (the "2007 CMS Policy Memorandum") that reaffirmed its prior interpretation of its conditions of participation that all hospitals (other than critical access hospitals) participating in the Medicare program are required to provide basic emergency care interventions regardless of whether or not the hospital maintains an emergency department. Our facilities licensed as hospitals are required to meet this requirement to maintain their participating provider status in the Medicare program. Our hospitals that do not have an emergency room, maintain a protocol for the transfer of patients requiring emergency treatment. While we believe such protocols satisfy CMS requirements, CMS could interpret such protocols to be inconsistent with the 2007 CMS Policy Memorandum, which could jeopardize each facility's participation in the Medicare program. Our surgical facilities must also satisfy the conditions of participation to be eligible to participate in the various state Medicaid programs. The requirements for certification under Medicare and Medicaid are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified for these programs, we may have to make changes from time to time in our facilities, equipment, personnel or services. Although we intend to continue to participate in these reimbursement programs, we cannot ensure that our surgical facilities will continue to qualify for participation. 
The Affordable Care Act and its associated regulations require a hospital to provide written disclosure of physician ownership interests to the hospital’s patients and on the hospital’s website and in any advertising, along with annual reports to the government detailing such interests. Additionally, hospitals that do not have 24/7 physician coverage are required to inform patients of this fact and receive signed acknowledgment from the patients of the disclosure. A hospital’s provider agreement may be terminated if it fails to provide the required notices. 
Utilization Review 
Federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards, are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed. These provisions include a requirement that a sampling of admissions of Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed by quality improvement organizations, which review the appropriateness of patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of MS-DRG classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay or cost. Quality improvement organizations may deny payment for services provided or assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to HHS that a provider which is in substantial noncompliance with the standards of the quality improvement organization be excluded from participation in the Medicare program. Utilization review is also a requirement of most non-governmental managed care organizations. 
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Medicare Fraud and Abuse Laws 
The Social Security Act of 1935 includes provisions addressing false statements, illegal remuneration and other instances of fraud and abuse in federal health care programs. These provisions include the statute commonly known as the federal Anti-Kickback statute (the "Anti-Kickback Statute"). The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits providers and others from, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying, directly or indirectly, any remuneration in return for either making a referral for, or ordering or arranging for, or recommending the order of, any item or service covered by a federal health care program, including, but not limited to, the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are criminal offenses punishable by imprisonment and fines of up to $25,000 for each violation. Civil violations are punishable by fines of up to $50,000 for each violation, as well as damages of up to three times the total amount of remuneration received from the government for health care claims. 
Because physician-owners of our surgical facilities are in a position to generate referrals to the facilities, the distribution of available cash to those investors could come under scrutiny under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute is violated if one purpose (as opposed to a primary or the sole purpose) of a payment to a provider is to induce referrals. Further, Section 6402(f)(2) of the Affordable Care Act amends the Anti-Kickback Statute by adding a provision to clarify that a person need not have actual knowledge of such section or specific intent to commit a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. Because none of these cases involved a joint venture such as those owning and operating our surgical facilities, it is not clear how a court would apply these holdings to our activities. It is clear, however, that a physician’s investment income from a surgical facility may not vary with the number of his or her referrals to the surgical facility. 
Under regulations issued by the Office of the Inspector General of HHS (the "OIG"), certain categories of activities are deemed not to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute (commonly referred to as the safe harbors). According to the preamble to these safe harbor regulations, the failure of a particular business arrangement to comply with the regulations does not determine whether the arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. The safe harbor regulations outline standards that, if complied with, protect conduct that might otherwise be deemed in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. When a transaction or relationship does not fit within a safe harbor, it does not mean that an Anti-Kickback Statute violation has occurred; rather, it means that the facts and circumstances as well as the intent of the parties related to a specific transaction or relationship must be examined to determine whether or not any illegal conduct has occurred. 
We believe the ownership and operations of our surgical facilities do not fit wholly within any of the safe harbors, but we attempt to structure our ASCs to fit as closely as possible within the safe harbor designed to protect distributions to physician-investors in ASCs who directly refer patients to the ASC and personally perform the procedures at the center as an extension of their practice (the "ASC Safe Harbor"). The ASC Safe Harbor protects four categories of investors, including ASCs owned by (1) general surgeons, (2) single-specialty physicians, (3) multi-specialty physicians and (4) hospital/physician joint ventures, provided that certain requirements are satisfied. These requirements include the following: 
•The ASC must be certified to participate in the Medicare program, and its operating and recovery room space must be dedicated exclusively to the center and not a part of a hospital (although such space may be leased from a hospital if such lease meets the requirements of the safe harbor for space rental). 
•Each investor must be either (a) a physician who derived at least one-third of his or her medical practice income for the previous fiscal year or 12-month period from performing procedures on the list of Medicare-covered procedures for ASCs, (b) a hospital, or (c) a person or entity not in a position to make or influence referrals to the center, nor to provide items or services to the center, nor employed by the center or any investor. 
•Unless all physician-investors are members of a single specialty, each physician-investor must perform at least one-third of his or her procedures at the ASC each year. This requirement is in addition to the requirement that the physician-investor has derived at least one-third of his or her medical practice income for the past year from performing procedures. 
•Physician-investors must have fully informed their referred patients of the physician’s investment. 
•The terms on which an investment interest is offered to an investor are not related to the previous or expected volume of referrals, services furnished or the amount of business otherwise generated from that investor to the entity. 
•Neither the ASC nor any other investor nor any person acting on their behalf may loan funds to or guarantee a loan for an investor if the investor uses any part of such loan to obtain the investment interest. 
•The amount of payment to an investor in return for the investment interest is directly proportional to the amount of the capital investment (including the fair market value of any pre-operational services rendered) of that investor. 
•All physician-investors, any hospital-investor and the center agree to treat patients receiving benefits or assistance under a federal health care program in a non-discriminatory manner. 
•All ancillary services performed at the ASC for beneficiaries of federal health care programs must be directly and integrally related to primary procedures performed at the center and may not be billed separately. 
•No hospital-investor may include on its cost report or any claim for payment from a federal health care program any costs associated with the ASC. 
•The ASC may not use equipment owned by or services provided by a hospital-investor unless such equipment is leased in accordance with a lease that complies with the Anti-Kickback Statute equipment rental safe harbor and such services are provided in accordance with a contract that complies with the Anti-Kickback Statute personal services and management contract safe harbor. 
•No hospital-investor may be in a position to make or influence referrals directly or indirectly to any other investor or the center. 
We believe that the ownership and operations of our surgical facilities will not fully satisfy the ASC Safe Harbor requirements for investment interests in ASCs because, among other things, we or one of our subsidiaries will generally be an investor in and provide management services to each ASC. While we believe our ASCs would nonetheless be found to be compliant with the Anti-Kickback Statute, we cannot assure you that the OIG would view our activities favorably even though we strive to achieve compliance with the remaining elements of this safe harbor. 
In addition, although we expect each physician-investor to utilize the ASCs as an extension of his or her practice and ask each physician-investor to certify this practice, we cannot assure you that all physician-investors will derive at least one-third of their medical practice income from performing Medicare-covered ASC procedures, perform one-third of their procedures at the centers or inform their referred patients of their investment interests. Interests in our ASC joint ventures are purchased at what we believe to be fair market value. Investors who purchase at a later time generally pay more for a given percentage interest than founding investors. The result is that while all investors are paid distributions in accordance with their ownership interests, for ASCs where there are later purchases, we cannot meet the safe harbor requirement that return on investment is directly proportional to the amount of capital investment. The OIG has on several occasions reviewed investments relating to ASCs, and in Advisory Opinion No. 07-05 (June 19, 2007), raised concerns that (a) purchases of interests from physicians might yield gains on investment rather than capital infusion to the ASCs, (b) such purchases could be meant to reward or influence the selling physicians’ referrals to the ASC or the hospital, and (c) such returns might not be directly proportional to the amount of capital invested.
In OIG Advisory Opinion No. 09-09 (July 29, 2009), the OIG concluded that an arrangement involving an ASC joint venture between a hospital and physicians involving the combination of their two ASCs into a single, larger ASC presented minimal risk of fraud or abuse, 
despite the fact that it did not fit within any applicable Anti-Kickback safe harbors. Additionally, the OIG stated that fair market value should be determined based only on the tangible assets of each ASC since the physician investors are referral sources for the ASC. The OIG stated that a cash flow-based valuation of the business contributed by the physician investors potentially would include the value of the physician investors’ referrals over the time that their ASC was in existence prior to the merger with the hospital’s ASC. The OIG went on to note that a valuation involving intangible assets would not necessarily result in a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, but would require a review of all the facts and circumstances. It is not clear whether the OIG is concerned about using a cash flow-based valuation in most health care transactions involving referral sources, or just transactions where the parties’ contributions would be valued differently for contributing the same assets if only one party’s contribution is valued as a going concern based on cash flow. Also, the OIG appears to be focused on historical cash flow rather than a projected, discounted cash flow, which is a commonly used valuation methodology.
Our hospital investments do not fit wholly within the safe harbor for investments in small entities because more than 40.0% of the investment interests are held by investors who are either in a position to refer to the hospital or who provide services to the hospital and more than 40.0% of the hospital’s gross revenue last year were derived from referrals generated by investors. However, we believe we comply with the remaining elements of the safe harbor. 
In addition to the physician ownership in our surgical facilities, other financial relationships of ours with potential referral sources could potentially be scrutinized under the Anti-Kickback Statute. We have entered into management agreements to manage the majority of our surgical facilities and physician practices. Most of these agreements call for our subsidiary to be paid a percentage of revenue-based management fee. Although there is a safe harbor for personal services and management contracts (the "Personal Services and Management Safe Harbor"), the Personal Services and Management Safe Harbor requires, among other things, that the amount of the aggregate compensation paid to the manager over the term of the agreement be set in advance. Because our management fees are generally based on a percentage of revenue, our management agreements do not typically meet this requirement. We do, however, believe that our management arrangements satisfy the other requirements of the Personal Services and Management Safe Harbor for personal services and management contracts. The OIG has taken the position in several advisory opinions that percentage-based management agreements are not protected by a safe harbor, and consequently, may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. We have implemented formal compliance programs designed to safeguard against overbilling and believe that our management agreements comply with the requirements of the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, we cannot assure you that the OIG would find our compliance programs to be adequate or that our management agreements would be found to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute. 
Certain of our ASCs have entered into arrangements for professional services, including arrangements for anesthesia services. In a Special Advisory Bulletin issued in April 2003, the OIG focused on "questionable" contractual arrangements where a health care provider in one line of business (the "Owner") expands into a related health care business by contracting with an existing provider of a related item or service (the "Manager/Supplier") to provide the new item or service to the Owner’s existing patient population, including federal health care program patients (so called "suspect Contractual Joint Ventures"). The Manager/Supplier not only manages the new line of business, but may also supply it with inventory, employees, space, billing, and other services. In other words, the Owner contracts out substantially the entire operation of the related line of business to the Manager/Supplier-otherwise a potential competitor-receiving in return the profits of the business as remuneration for its referrals. Through an Advisory Opinion, the OIG extended this suspect contractual joint venture analysis to arrangements between anesthesiologists and physician owners of ASCs. In Advisory Opinion No. 12-06 (May 25, 2012), the OIG concluded that certain proposed arrangements between anesthesia groups and physician-owned ASCs could result in prohibited remuneration under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. We believe our arrangements for anesthesia services are distinguishable from those described in Advisory Opinion 12-06 (May 25, 2012) and are in compliance with the requirements of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. However, we cannot assure you that regulatory authorities would agree with that position. 
We also may guarantee a surgical facility’s third-party debt financing and certain lease obligations as part of our obligations under a management agreement. Physician investors are generally not required to enter into similar guarantees. The OIG might take the position that the failure of the physician investors to enter into similar guarantees represents a special benefit to the physician investors given to induce patient referrals and that such failure constitutes a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. We believe that the management fees (and in some cases guarantee fees) are adequate compensation to us for the credit risk associated with the guarantees and that the failure of the physician investors to enter into similar guarantees does not create a material risk of violating the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, the OIG has not issued any guidance in this regard. 
The OIG is authorized to issue advisory opinions regarding the interpretation and applicability of the Anti-Kickback Statute, including whether an activity constitutes grounds for the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions. We have not, however, sought such an opinion regarding any of our arrangements. If it were determined that our activities, or those of our surgical facilities or hospitals, violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, we, our subsidiaries, our officers, our directors and each surgical facility and hospital investor could be subject, individually, to substantial monetary liability, prison sentences and/or exclusion from participation in any health care program funded in whole or in part by the U.S. government, including Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE or state health care programs. 
Evolving interpretations of current, or the adoption of new, federal or state laws or regulations, such as the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (discussed below), could affect many of our arrangements. Law enforcement authorities, including the OIG, the courts and Congress, are increasing their scrutiny of arrangements between health care providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to exchange remuneration for patient care referrals or opportunities. Investigators have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction to determine the underlying purposes of payments between health care providers and potential referral sources. 
On November 20, 2020, CMS and the OIG issued final rules that modify the federal physician self-referral law, or Stark Law, regulations and the federal anti-kickback and civil monetary penalty for beneficiary inducement statutes and regulations. The intent of the final rules is to reduce over-burdensome and unnecessary regulatory barriers to value-based compensation models and accelerate the transformation of the health care system into one that better promotes the coordination of care among providers. Among other things, the final rules create new anti-kickback and beneficiary inducement statute safe harbors and Stark Law exceptions for certain value based arrangements and arrangements that involve the donation of cybersecurity technology. In addition, the final rules provide additional guidance on several key compliance requirements, including fair market value and commercial reasonableness, that must be met in order for physicians and health care providers to comply with the Stark Law. We cannot yet predict the impact that the final rules will have on our surgery centers and hospitals.  
Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act
    In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the U.S. recently enacted a new law known as the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (the "EKRA"). The EKRA is contained within the broader Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (the "SUPPORT Act"). The EKRA creates a new federal crime for knowingly and willfully: (1) soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referring a patient to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory; or (2) paying or offering any remuneration to induce such a referral or in exchange for an individual using the services of a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Each conviction under the EKRA is punishable by up to $200,000 in monetary damages, imprisonment for up to ten (10) years, or both. Unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute, the EKRA is not limited to services reimbursable under a government health care program. While the SUPPORT Act targets substance abuse disorder prevention and recovery, the scope of EKRA is not limited to substance abuse drug testing (only one service line of a multitude provided by labs), and therefore it appears to prohibit payment for any patient referral to any laboratory for any service, unless an exception applies. While the EKRA does contain certain exceptions similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute Safe Harbors, those exceptions are more narrow than the Anti-Kickback Statute Safe Harbors.
Federal Physician Self-Referral Law 
The Stark Law prohibits certain self-referrals for health care services. The Stark Law prohibits a practitioner, including a physician, dentist or podiatrist, from referring patients to an entity with which the practitioner or a member of his or her immediate family has a "financial relationship" for the provision of certain "designated health services" that are paid for in whole or in part by Medicare or Medicaid unless an exception applies. "Designated health services" include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical laboratory services and radiology services. The term "financial relationship" is broadly defined and includes most types of ownership and compensation relationships. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from seeking payment from Medicare or Medicaid for services that are rendered through a prohibited referral. If an entity is paid for services provided through a prohibited referral, it may be required to refund the payments. Violations of the Stark Law may also result in the imposition of damages equal to three times the amount improperly claimed and civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per prohibited claim and $100,000 per prohibited circumvention scheme and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Notably, "designated health services" does not include surgical services that are provided in an ASC. Furthermore, Stark Law regulations specifically define the term "designated health services" to not include services that are reimbursed by Medicare as part of a composite rate, such as services that are provided in an ASC. However, if designated health services are provided by an ASC and separately billed, referrals to the ASC by a physician-investor would be prohibited by the Stark Law. Because our facilities that are licensed as ASCs do not have independent laboratories and do not provide designated health services apart from surgical services, we do not believe referrals to these facilities by physician-investors are prohibited. If legislation or regulations are implemented that prohibit physicians from referring patients to surgical facilities in which the physician has a beneficial interest, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. 
The Stark Law currently includes the Whole Hospital Exception, which applies to physician ownership of a hospital, provided such ownership is in the whole hospital and the physician is authorized to perform services at the hospital. We believe that physician investments in our facilities licensed as hospitals meet this requirement. However, certain changes to the Whole Hospital Exception were made by the Affordable Care Act including: 
•a prohibition on hospitals from having any physician ownership unless the hospital already had physician ownership and a Medicare provider agreement in effect as of December 31, 2010; 
•a limitation on the percentage of total physician ownership or investment interests in the hospital or entity whose assets include the hospital to the percentage of physician ownership or investment as of March 23, 2010; 
•a prohibition from expanding the number of beds, operating rooms, and procedure rooms for which it is licensed after March 23, 2010, unless the hospital obtains an exception from the Secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services (the "Secretary"); 
•a requirement that return on investment be proportionate to the investment by each investor; 
•restrictions on preferential treatment of physician versus non-physician investors; 
•a requirement for written disclosures of physician ownership interests to the hospital’s patients and on the hospital’s website and in any advertising, along with annual reports to the government detailing such interests; 
•a prohibition on the hospital or other investors from providing financing to physician investors; 
•a requirement that any hospital that does not have 24/7 physician coverage inform patients of this fact and receive signed acknowledgments from the patients of the disclosure; and 
•a prohibition on "grandfathered" status for any physician owned hospital that converted from an ASC to a hospital on or after March 23, 2010. 
We cannot predict whether other proposed amendments to the Whole Hospital Exception will be included in any future legislation, including a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or if Congress will adopt any similar provisions that would prohibit or otherwise restrict physicians from holding ownership interests in hospitals. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
In 2010, CMS issued a "self-referral disclosure protocol" for hospitals and other providers that wish to self-disclose potential violations of the Stark Law to CMS and to attempt to resolve those potential violations and any related overpayment liabilities at levels below the maximum penalties and amounts set forth in the statute.
In addition to the physician ownership in our surgical facilities, we have other financial relationships with potential referral sources that potentially could be scrutinized under the Stark Law. We have entered into personal service agreements, such as medical director agreements, with physicians at our surgical hospitals and physician owners within our physician practices may make referrals for certain designated health services within their physician practices. We believe that our agreements with referral sources satisfy the requirements of the personal service arrangements exception and that our physician practices satisfy the physician services and in-office ancillary services exceptions to the Stark Law and have implemented formal compliance programs designed to ensure continued compliance. However, we cannot assure you that the OIG or CMS would find our compliance programs to be adequate or that our agreements with referral sources would be found to comply with the Stark Law. 
Other Fraud and Abuse Laws 
The Medicare Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, as amended by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, ("HIPAA"), and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, impose civil monetary penalties and exclusion from state and federal health care programs on providers who commit violations of fraud and abuse laws. HIPAA authorizes the Secretary, and in some cases requires the Secretary, to exclude individuals and entities that the Secretary determines have "committed an act" in violation of applicable fraud and abuse laws or improperly filed claims in violation of such laws from participating in any federal health care program. HIPAA also expanded the Secretary’s authority to exclude a person involved in fraudulent activity from participating in a program providing health benefits, whether directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by the U.S. government. Additionally, under HIPAA, individuals who hold a direct or indirect ownership or controlling interest in an entity that is found to violate these laws may also be excluded from Medicare and Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs if the individual knew or should have known, or acted with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of, the truth or falsity of the information of the activity leading to the conviction or exclusion of the entity, or where the individual is an officer or managing employee of such entity. This standard does not require that specific intent to defraud be proven by OIG. Under HIPAA it is also a crime to defraud any commercial health care benefit program. 
Federal and State Privacy and Security Requirements 
We are subject to HIPAA, including the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the "HITECH Act"), which was enacted as part of The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The HITECH Act strengthened the requirements and significantly increased the penalties for violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. In 2013, HHS issued the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, which became effective on March 26, 2013. The HIPAA Omnibus Rule requires us to notify patients of any unauthorized access, acquisition, or disclosure of their unsecured protected health information in all situations except those in which we can demonstrate that there is a low probability that the protected health information has been compromised. We have the burden of demonstrating through a risk assessment that a breach of protected health information has not occurred.
The HIPAA privacy standards apply to individually identifiable information held or disclosed by a covered entity in any form, whether communicated electronically, on paper or orally. These standards impose extensive administrative requirements on us. These standards require our compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of this health information. They create rights for patients in their health information, such as the right to amend their health information, and they require us to impose these rules, by contract, on any business associate to whom we disclose such information in order to perform functions on our behalf. 
The HIPAA security standards require us to establish and maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and the availability of electronic protected health and related financial information. Although the security standards do not reference or advocate a specific technology, and covered health care providers, plans and clearinghouses have the flexibility to choose their own technical solutions, the security standards have required us to implement significant new systems, business procedures and training programs. 
Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in civil and criminal penalties. The HITECH Act strengthened the requirements of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations and significantly increased the penalties for violations by introducing a tiered penalty system, with penalties of up to $50,000 per violation with a maximum civil penalty of $1.5 million in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple requirements, resulting in possible penalties well in excess of $1.5 million. Under the HITECH Act, HHS is required to conduct periodic compliance audits of covered entities and their business associates. The HITECH Act and the HIPAA Omnibus Rule also extend the application of certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations to business associates and subjects business associates to civil and criminal penalties for violation of the regulations. 
The HITECH Act authorizes State Attorneys General to bring civil actions seeking either an injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations or the new data breach law that affects the privacy of their state residents. We expect vigorous enforcement of the HITECH Act’s requirements by HHS and State Attorneys General. HHS has allocated increased funding towards HIPAA enforcement activity and such enforcement activity has seen a marked increase over recent years. We cannot predict whether our surgical facilities will be able to comply with the final rules and the financial impact to our surgical facilities in implementing the requirements under the final rules when they take effect, or whether our surgical hospitals will be selected for an audit, or the results of such an audit. 
Our facilities also remain subject to any state laws that relate to privacy or the reporting of data breaches that are more restrictive than the regulations issued under HIPAA and the requirements of the HITECH Act. For example, various state laws and regulations may require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving certain personal information, such as social security numbers, dates of birth and credit card information. 
HIPAA Administrative Simplification Requirements 
The HIPAA transaction regulations were issued to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. These regulations include standards that health care providers must follow when electronically transmitting certain health care transactions, such as health care claims.
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act 
Our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act ("EMTALA"). This federal law requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency department for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions or transfer exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. Off-campus facilities such as surgery centers that lack emergency departments or otherwise do not treat emergency medical conditions generally are not subject to EMTALA. They must, however, have policies in place that explain how the location should proceed in an emergency situation, such as transferring the patient to the closest hospital with an emergency department. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay, including civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the government health care programs. In addition, an injured patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against that other hospital. CMS has actively enforced EMTALA and has indicated that it will continue to do so in the future. We believe that our surgical hospitals comply with EMTALA. 
State Regulation
Many of the states in which our surgical facilities operate have adopted statutes and/or regulations that prohibit the payment of kickbacks or any type of remuneration in exchange for patient referrals and that prohibit health care providers from, in certain circumstances, referring a patient to a health care facility in which the provider has an ownership or investment interest. While these statutes generally mirror the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Stark Law, they vary widely in their scope and application. Some are specifically limited to health care services that are paid for in whole or in part by the Medicaid program; others apply to all health care services regardless of payor; and others apply only to state-defined designated services, which may differ from the designated health services under the Stark Law. In addition, many states have adopted statutes that mirror the False Claims Act and that prohibit the filing of a false or fraudulent claim with a state governmental agency. We intend to comply with all applicable state health care laws, rules and regulations. However, these laws, rules and regulations have typically been the subject of limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. As a result, we cannot assure you that our surgical facilities will not be investigated or scrutinized by the governmental authorities empowered to do so or, if challenged, that their activities would be found to be lawful. A determination of non-compliance with the applicable state health care laws, rules, and regulations could subject our surgical facilities to civil and criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
We are also subject to various state insurance statutes and regulations that prohibit us from submitting inaccurate, incorrect or misleading claims. Many state insurance laws and regulations are broadly worded and could be implicated, for example, if our surgical facilities were to adjust an out-of-network co-payment or other patient responsibility amounts without fully disclosing the adjustment on the claim submitted to the payor. While some of our surgical facilities adjust the out-of-network costs of patient co-payment and deductible amounts to reflect in-network co-payment costs when providing services to patients whose health insurance is covered by a payor with 
which the surgical facilities are not contracted, our policy is to fully disclose adjustments in the claims submitted to the payors. We believe that our surgical facilities are in compliance with all applicable state insurance laws and regulations regarding the submission of claims. We cannot assure you, however, that none of our surgical facilities’ insurance claims will ever be challenged. If we were found to be in violation of a state’s insurance laws or regulations, we could be forced to discontinue the violative practice, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations, and we could be subject to fines and criminal penalties. 
Fee Splitting; Corporate Practice of Medicine 
The laws of many states prohibit physicians from splitting fees with non-physicians (i.e., sharing in a percentage of professional fees), prohibit non-physician entities (such as us) from practicing medicine and exercising control over or employing physicians and prohibit referrals to facilities in which physicians have a financial interest. The existence, interpretation and enforcement of these laws vary significantly from state to state. In light of these restrictions, in certain states we facilitate the provision of physician services by maintaining long-term management services agreements through our subsidiaries with affiliated professional contractors, which employ or contract with physicians and other health care professionals to provide physician professional services. Under these arrangements, our subsidiaries perform only non-medical administrative services, do not represent that they offer medical services and do not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physicians employed by the affiliated professional contractors. Although we believe that the fees we receive from affiliated professional contractors have been structured in a manner that is compliant with applicable fee-splitting laws, it is possible that a government regulator could interpret such fee arrangements to be in violation of certain fee-splitting laws. Future interpretations of, or changes in, these laws might require structural and organizational modifications of our existing relationships, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to appropriately modify such relationships. In addition, statutes in some states could restrict our expansion into those states. 
Clinical Laboratory Regulation 
Our clinical laboratories are subject to federal oversight under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ("CLIA") which extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. CLIA requires that all clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections. Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as "high complexity," "moderate complexity," or "waived." Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate complexity laboratories. Laboratories performing only waived tests, which are tests determined by the Food and Drug Administration to have a low potential for error and requiring little oversight, may apply for a certificate of waiver exempting them from most of the requirements of CLIA. Our operations also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations different from or more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements, but no assurances can be given that our laboratories will pass all future licensure or certification inspections.
Regulatory Compliance Program 
We have in place and continue to enhance a company-wide compliance program that focuses on all areas of regulatory compliance including billing, reimbursement, cost reporting practices and contractual arrangements with referral sources. 
This regulatory compliance program is intended to help ensure that high standards of conduct are maintained in the operation of our business and that policies and procedures are implemented so that employees act in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and company policies. Under the regulatory compliance program, every employee and certain contractors involved in patient care, and coding and billing, receive initial and periodic legal compliance and ethics training. In addition, we regularly monitor our ongoing compliance efforts and develop and implement policies and procedures designed to foster compliance with the law. The program also includes a mechanism for employees to report, without fear of retaliation, any suspected legal or ethical violations to their supervisors, designated compliance officers in our facilities, our compliance hotline or directly to our corporate compliance office. We believe our compliance program is consistent with standard industry practices. However, we cannot provide any assurances that our compliance program will detect all violations of law or protect against qui tam suits or government enforcement actions. 
“Controlled Company” Status
Prior to the completion of a public offering of our common stock and a concurrent private placement in the fourth quarter of 2022, we were a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq rules and qualified for exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements. Although we are no longer a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of Nasdaq, we may qualify for certain exceptions during a one-year transition period and our largest stockholder continues to have significant influence over the Company. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Governance Risks-Our largest stockholder has significant influence over us, including influence over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.”
