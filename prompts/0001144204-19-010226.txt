Business
 ​
 Except as otherwise indicated, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “KCAP” refer to KCAP Financial, Inc. 
 GENERAL 
 We are an internally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that is regulated as business development company (“BDC”), under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). The Company was formed in August 2006 under our former name, Kohlberg Capital Corporation, and completed our initial public offering in December 2006. 
 The Company originates, structures, and invests in senior secured term loans and mezzanine debt primarily in privately-held middle market companies (the “Debt Securities Portfolio”). In addition, from time to time the Company may invest in the equity securities of privately held middle market companies. 
 On November 8, 2018, we entered into an agreement with LibreMax Intermediate Holdings, LP (“LibreMax”) under which our wholly-owned subsidiary Commodore Holdings, LLC (“Commodore”) agreed to sell Katonah Debt Advisors, L.L.C. (“Katonah Debt Advisors”), Trimaran Advisors, L.L.C. (“Trimaran Advisors”), and Trimaran Advisors Management, L.L.C. (“Trimaran Advisors Management” and, together with Katonah Debt Advisors and Trimaran Advisors, the “Disposed Manager Affiliates”) to LibreMax for a cash purchase price of approximately $37.9 million (the “LibreMax Transaction”). In connection with the closing of the LibreMax Transaction on December 31, 2018, Commodore sold the Disposed Manager Affiliates, which manage collateralized loan obligation funds (“CLO Funds”), to LibreMax for a cash purchase price of approximately $37.9 million. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our remaining asset management subsidiaries (the “Asset Manager Affiliates”) were comprised of Commodore, Katonah Management Holdings, LLC, Katonah X Management LLC (“Katonah X Management”), Katonah 2007-1 Management, LLC (“Katonah 2007-I Management”) and KCAP Management, LLC. Commodore, Katonah X Management and Katonah 2007-1 Management have no operations and are expected to be liquidated in the normal course. 
 On December 14, 2018, we entered into a stock purchase and transaction agreement (the “Externalization Agreement”) with BC Partners Advisors L.P. (“BCP”), an affiliate of BC Partners LLP (“BC Partners”), pursuant to which our management function would be externalized (the “Externalization”) and Sierra Crest Investment Management LLC, an affiliate of BC Partners (the “Adviser”) would be appointed as our investment adviser, subject to our stockholders’ approval of the proposed investment advisory agreement between us and the Adviser (the “Advisory Agreement”). At a special meeting of our stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) held on February 19, 2019, our stockholders approved the Advisory Agreement. As described further below, under “The Externalization Agreement,” if the transactions contemplated by the Externalization Agreement are completed, upon closing of the Externalization (the “Closing”), we will commence operations as an externally managed BDC managed by the Adviser. 
 The Company has also invested in debt and subordinated securities issued by CLO Funds (the “CLO Fund Securities”). Our investments in CLO Fund Securities are primarily managed by our formerly wholly-owned asset management subsidiaries, Trimaran Advisors and Trimaran Advisors Management, but from time-to-time the Company has made investments in CLO Fund Securities managed by other asset managers. The CLO Funds typically invest in broadly syndicated loans, high-yield bonds and other credit instruments. 
 Our investments in CLO Fund Securities, which are primarily made up of minority investments in the subordinated securities or preferred stock of CLO Funds managed by the Disposed Manager Affiliates, are anticipated to provide the Company with recurring cash distributions. 
 The Company may also invest in other investments such as loans to smaller private companies, publicly-traded companies, high-yield bonds, joint ventures, managed funds, partnerships, and distressed debt securities. The Company may also receive warrants or options to purchase common stock in connection with our debt investments.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 In our Debt Securities Portfolio, our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation from the investments in senior secured term loans, mezzanine debt and selected equity investments in privately-held middle market companies. We define the middle market as comprising companies with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of $10 million to $50 million and/or total debt of $25 million to $150 million. We primarily invest in first and second lien term loans which, because of their priority in a company’s capital structure, we expect will have lower default rates and higher rates of recovery of principal if there is a default and which we expect will create a stable stream of interest income. The investments in our Debt Securities Portfolio are all or predominantly below investment grade, and have speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. 
 Because we are internally managed by our executive officers under the supervision of our Board of Directors, we incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals. 
 As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to continue to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a BDC, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% (or the 150% asset coverage ratio effective as of March 29, 2019) after such borrowing. The 1940 Act also generally prohibits us from declaring any cash dividend or distribution on any class of our capital stock if our asset coverage is below 200% (or the 150% asset coverage ratio effective as of March 29, 2019) at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution. 
 On March 29, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act (“SBCA”). As a result, the Company’s asset coverage requirement for senior securities will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective as of March 29, 2019. However, despite the SBCA, we will continue to be prohibited by the indentures governing our 6.125% Notes (as defined and discussed in Note 6- “Borrowings” below) from making distributions on our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, falls below 200%. In any such event, we would be prohibited from making distributions required in order to maintain our status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”). 
 Subject to market conditions, we intend to grow our portfolio of assets by raising additional capital, including through the prudent use of leverage available to us. Because we also recognize the need to have funds available for operating our business and to make investments, we seek to have adequate liquidity at all times to cover normal cyclical swings in funding availability and to allow us to meet abnormal and unexpected funding requirements. As a result, we may hold varying amounts of cash and other short-term investments from time-to-time for liquidity purposes. 
 We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) and intend to operate in a manner to maintain our RIC status. Accordingly, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary tax-basis taxable income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our shareholders as dividends. To maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must meet the specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute to our stockholders annually at least 90% of our net ordinary tax-basis taxable income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, for each year. 
 We employ an experienced team of seven investment professionals and 13 total staff members. Dayl W. Pearson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and one of our directors, has been in the financial services industry for more than 40 years. During the past 27 years, Mr. Pearson has focused almost exclusively on the middle market and has originated, structured and underwritten over $7 billion of debt and equity securities. R. Jon Corless, our Chief Investment Officer with primary responsibility for the Debt Securities Portfolio, has managed investment portfolios in excess of $4 billion at several institutions and has been responsible for managing portfolios of leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, mezzanine securities and middle market loans. Edward U. Gilpin, our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer, has been in financial services for over 35 years, with significant experience in overseeing the financial operations and reporting for asset management businesses.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Under the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X and the Financial Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), Financial Services — Investment Companies (“ASC 946”), we are precluded from consolidating portfolio company investments, including those in which we have a controlling interest, unless the portfolio company is another investment company. An exception to this general principle in ASC 946 occurs if we own a controlled operating company that provides all or substantially all of its services directly to us, or to an investment company of ours. Other than KCAP Funding I LLC, Kohlberg Capital Funding I LLC, KCAP Senior Funding I Holdings LLC and KCAP Senior Funding I LLC, none of the investments made by us qualify for this exception. Therefore, our portfolio investments, including our investments in the Asset Manager Affiliates and the Joint Venture (as defined below), are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with any adjustments to fair value recognized as “Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)” in our statement of operations until the investment is exited, at which point any gain or loss on exit is reclassified and recognized as a “Net Realized Gain (Loss) from Investments.” 
 Our common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “KCAP.” The net asset value per share of our common stock at December 31, 2018 was $4.23. On December 31, 2018, the last reported sale price of a share of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market was $3.46. In addition, our 6.125% notes due 2022 (“6.125% Notes Due 2022”) are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “KCAPL.” As of December 31, 2018, the last reported price of our 6.125% Notes Due 2022, which have a par value of $25.00, was $24.74.

Investment Portfolio 
 Our investment portfolio generates investment income, which is generally used to pay principal and interest on our borrowings, operating expenses, and to fund our distributions to our stockholders. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of our Debt Securities Portfolio and investments in CLO Fund Securities. 
  Debt Securities Portfolio.   We target privately-held middle market companies that have strong historical cash flows, experienced management teams and identifiable and defendable market positions in industries with positive dynamics. We generally target companies that generate positive cash flows because we look to cash flows as the primary source for servicing debt. 
 We employ a disciplined approach in the selection and monitoring of our investments. Generally, we target investments that will generate a current return through interest income to provide for stability in our shareholder distributions and place less reliance on realized capital gains from our investments. Our investment philosophy is focused on preserving capital with an appropriate return profile relative to risk. Our investment due diligence and selection generally focuses on an underlying issuer’s net cash flow after capital expenditures to service its debt rather than on multiples of net income, valuations or other broad benchmarks which frequently miss the nuances of an issuer’s business and prospective financial performance. We also generally avoid concentrations in any one industry or issuer. We manage risk by following our internal credit policies and procedures. 
 When we extend senior and junior secured term loans, we will generally take a security interest in the available assets of the portfolio company, including the equity interests of its subsidiaries, which we expect

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 to help mitigate the risk that we will not be repaid. Nonetheless, there is a possibility that our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. Structurally, mezzanine debt ranks subordinate in priority of payment to senior term loans and is often unsecured. Relative to equity, mezzanine debt ranks senior to common and preferred equity in a borrower’s capital structure. Typically, mezzanine debt has elements of both debt and equity instruments, offering the fixed returns in the form of interest payments associated with a loan, while providing an opportunity to participate in the capital appreciation of a borrower, if any, through an equity interest that is typically in the form of equity purchased at the time the mezzanine loan is originated or warrants to purchase equity at a future date at a fixed cost. Mezzanine debt generally earns a higher return than senior secured debt due to its higher risk profile and usually less restrictive covenants. The warrants associated with mezzanine debt are typically detachable, which allows lenders to receive repayment of their principal on an agreed amortization schedule while retaining an equity interest in the borrower. Mezzanine debt also may include a “put” feature, which permits the holder to sell its equity interest back to the borrower at a price determined through an agreed formula. 
 Below are summary attributes for our Debt Securities Portfolio as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018: 
 •

 represented approximately 54% of total investment portfolio; 
 ​
 •

 contained credit instruments issued by corporate borrowers; 
 ​
 •

 primarily comprised of senior secured and junior secured loans (52% and 48% of Debt Securities Portfolio, respectively); 
 ​
 •

 spread across 21 different industries and 51 different entities; 
 ​
 •

 average par balance per investment of approximately $2.8 million; 
 ​
 •

 five investments were on non-accrual status; and 
 ​
 •

 the weighted average contractual interest rate on our loans and debt securities was approximately 10.0%, and the weighted average contractual interest rate on our loans and debt securities, adjusted for non-accrual investments, was approximately 9.1%. 
 ​
 Our Debt Securities Portfolio investments generally average between $1 million to $20 million, although particular investments may be larger or smaller. The size of individual investments will vary according to their priority in a company’s capital structure, with larger investments in more secure positions in an effort to maximize capital preservation. The size of our investments and maturity dates may vary as follows: 
 •

 senior secured term loans from $2 to $20 million maturing in five to seven years; 
 ​
 •

 second lien term loans from $5 to $15 million maturing in six to eight years; 
 ​
 •

 senior unsecured loans from $5 to $23 million maturing in six to eight years; 
 ​
 •

 mezzanine loans from $5 to $15 million maturing in seven to ten years; and 
 ​
 •

 equity investments from $1 to $5 million.

  Investment in the Joint Venture.   During the third quarter of 2017, the Company and Freedom 3 Opportunities LLC (“Freedom 3 Opportunities”), an affiliate of Freedom 3 Capital LLC, entered into an agreement to create KCAP Freedom 3 LLC (the “Joint Venture”). The Company and Freedom 3 Opportunities contributed approximately $37 million and $25 million, respectively, in assets to the Joint Venture, which in turn used the assets to capitalize a new fund, KCAP F3C Senior Funding, L.L.C. (the “Fund”) managed by KCAP Management, LLC, one of the Asset Manager Affiliates. In addition, the Fund used cash on hand and borrowings under a credit facility to purchase approximately $184 million of primarily middle-market loans from the Company and the Company used the proceeds from such sale to redeem approximately $147 million in debt issued by KCAP Senior Funding I, LLC (“KCAP Senior Funding”). The Fund invests primarily in middle-market loans and the Joint Venture partners may source middle-market loans from time-to-time for the Fund.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Fund was refinanced through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes. The Joint Venture purchased 100% of the subordinated notes issued by the Fund. In connection with the refinancing, the Joint Venture made a cash distribution to the Company of approximately $12.6 million. Approximately $11.2 million of this distribution was a reduction in the cost basis of the Company’s investment in the Joint Venture. The final determination of the tax attributes of distributions from the Joint Venture is made on an annual (full calendar year) basis at the end of the year, therefore, any estimate of tax attributes of distributions made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of distributions for the full year. 
 The Company owns a 60% equity investment in the Joint Venture. The Joint Venture is structured as an unconsolidated Delaware limited liability company. All portfolio and other material decisions regarding the Joint Venture must be submitted to its board of managers, which is comprised of four members, two of whom were selected by the Company and two of whom were selected by Freedom 3 Opportunities, and must be approved by at least one member appointed by the Company and one appointed by Freedom 3 Opportunities. In addition, certain matters may be approved by the Joint Venture’s investment committee, which is comprised of one member appointed by the Company and one member appointed by Freedom 3 Opportunities. 
 The Company has determined that the Joint Venture is an investment company under ASC 946, however, in accordance with such guidance; the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than a wholly owned investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. The Company does not consolidate its interest in the Joint Venture because the Company does not control the Joint Venture due to allocation of the voting rights among the Joint Venture partners. 
  CLO Fund Securities.   Our investments in CLO Fund Securities are primarily made up of minority investments in the subordinated securities or preferred stock of CLO Funds managed by the Disposed Manager Affiliates. 
 Below are summary attributes for our CLO Fund Securities, as of and for the year-ended December 31, 2018, unless otherwise specified: 
 •

 CLO Fund Securities represented approximately 16% of total investment portfolio at December 31, 2018; 
 ​
 •

 90% of CLO Fund Securities Portfolio represented investments in subordinated securities or equity securities issued by CLO Funds and 10% of CLO Fund Securities Portfolio was a rated note; 
 ​
 •

 all CLO Funds invested primarily in credit instruments issued by corporate borrowers; 
 ​
 •

 U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis investment income of $6.4 million; cash distributions received of approximately $19.5 million (approximately $3.5 million taxable distributable income, $16.0 million tax return of capital to KCAP). 
 ​
  Asset Manager Affiliates.   As of December 31, 2018, our Asset Manager Affiliates were valued at approximately $3.5 million. As discussed above, in connection with the LibreMax Transaction, on December 31, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary Commodore Holdings, LLC sold the Disposed Manager Affiliates, which represented substantially all of our investment in the Asset Manager Affiliates, to LibreMax. Commodore Holdings, LLC received cash proceeds of $37.9 million from the sale and distributed $33.8 million in cash to the Company. All of this cash distribution was recorded as a return of capital, and no realized gain or loss was recognized on this transaction. As of December 31, 2017, our Asset Manager Affiliates had approximately $3.0 billion of par value of assets under management on which they earned management fees, and were valued at approximately $38.8 million. 
 The Disposed Manager Affiliates manage CLO Funds that invest in broadly syndicated loans, high yield bonds and other credit instruments. The CLO Funds managed by the Disposed Manager Affiliates consist primarily of credit instruments issued by corporations. Accordingly, certain CLO Fund investments were reclassified from CLO Funds managed by our affiliates to CLO Funds managed by unaffiliated third-parties on December 31, 2018.

 ​
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On March 1, 2018, KCAP Funding I, LLC (“Funding”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with certain institutional lenders, State Bank and Trust Company, as the administrative agent, lead arranger and bookrunner, CIBC Bank USA, as documentation agent and the Company, as the servicer. 
 The maximum commitment amount of the Revolving Credit Facility is $50 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of LIBOR rate loans, an adjusted LIBOR rate for the applicable interest period plus 3.25% or (ii) in the case of base rate loans, the prime rate plus 3.25%. Funding will pay a fee on any undrawn amounts of 0.375% per annum; provided that if 50% or less of the Revolving Credit Facility is drawn, the fee will be 0.50% per annum. 
 The Company intends to use the proceeds from borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes, including to acquire certain qualifying loans, and such other uses as permitted under the Loan and Security Agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”). 
 The maturity date is the earlier of: (a) March 1, 2022 and (b) the date upon which all loans shall become due and payable in full, whether by acceleration or otherwise, as a result of a default by the Company, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are repayable by the Company at any time. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets held by Funding, and the Company has pledged its interests in Funding as collateral to State Bank and Trust Company, as the administrative agent, to secure the obligations of Funding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, as well as usual and customary events of default for revolving credit facilities of this nature. At December 31, 2018, Funding was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. 
 As of December 31, 2018, $26.4 million principal amount of borrowings was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Structure and Process 
 Structure 
 We are an internally managed BDC with 13 full-time employees. The following are our key functional teams that execute our business strategy: 
 •

 Our BDC investment team consists of seven professionals who originate, structure, and invest in senior secured term loans, mezzanine debt and selected equity securities primarily in privately-held middle market companies as well as CLO Funds, joint ventures, managed funds, partnerships and distressed debt securities. The Company may also receive warrants or options to purchase common stock in connection with our debt investments. 
 ​
 •

 The remainder of the employees include senior management, operations, financial accounting, compliance and human resource personnel.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Process 
 The Company will review potential investment opportunities and conduct due diligence that typically includes a review of historical and prospective financial information, participation in a presentation held by the prospective portfolio company’s management and/or the transaction sponsor, a review of the prospective portfolio company’s product or service, an analysis and understanding of the drivers of the particular industry in which the prospective portfolio company operates, and an assessment of the debt service capabilities of the prospective portfolio company under a variety of assumed forecast scenarios. 
 Due to our ability to source transactions through multiple channels, we expect to continue to maintain a pipeline of opportunities to allow comparative risk return analysis and selectivity. By focusing on the drivers of revenue and cash flow, we develop our own underwriting cases, and multiple stress and event specific case scenarios for each company analyzed. 
 We focus on lending and investing opportunities in: 
 •

 companies with EBITDA of $10 to $50 million; 
 ​
 •

 companies with financing needs of $25 to $150 million; 
 ​
 •

 companies purchased by well-regarded private equity sponsors; 
 ​
 •

 non-sponsored companies with successful management and systems; 
 ​
 •

 high-yield bonds and broadly syndicated loans to larger companies on a selective basis; and 
 ​
 •

 equity co-investment in companies where we see substantial opportunity for capital appreciation. 
 ​
 We source investment opportunities from: 
 •

 private equity sponsors; 
 ​
 •

 regional investment banks for non-sponsored companies; 
 ​
 •

 other middle market lenders with whom we can participate in loans; and 
 ​
 In our experience, good credit judgment is based on a thorough understanding of both the qualitative and quantitative factors that determine a company’s performance. Our analysis begins with an understanding of the fundamentals of the industry in which a company operates, including the current economic environment and the outlook for the industry. We also focus on the company’s relative position within the industry and its historical ability to weather economic cycles. Other key qualitative factors include the experience and depth of the management team and the financial sponsor, if any. 
 Only after we have a comprehensive understanding of the qualitative factors do we focus on quantitative metrics. We believe that with the context provided by the qualitative analysis, we can gain a better understanding of a company’s financial performance. We analyze a potential portfolio company’s sales growth and margins in the context of its competition as well as its ability to manage its working capital requirements and its ability to generate consistent cash flow. Based upon this historical analysis, we develop a set of projections which represents a reasonable underwriting case of most likely outcomes for the company over the period of our investment. We also look at potential downside cases to determine a company’s ability to service its debt in a stressed credit environment. 
 Elements of the qualitative analysis we use in evaluating investment opportunities include the following: 
 •

 industry fundamentals; 
 ​
 •

 competitive position and market share; 
 ​
 •

 past ability to work through historical down-cycles; 
 ​
 •

 quality of financial and technology infrastructure; 
 ​
 •

 sourcing risks and opportunities; 
 ​
 •

 labor and union strategy; 
 ​

 technology risk;

 •

 diversity of customer base and product lines; 
 ​
 •

 quality of financial sponsor (if applicable); and

 ​
 Elements of the quantitative analysis we use in evaluating investment opportunities include the following: 
 •

 income statement analysis of growth and margin trends; 
 ​
 •

 cash flow analysis of capital expenditures and free cash flow; 
 ​
 •

 financial ratio and market share standing among comparable companies;

 •

 downside protection to limit losses in an event of default; 
 ​
 •

 risk adjusted returns and relative value analysis; and 
 ​
 •

 enterprise and asset valuations. 
 ​
 The origination, structuring and credit approval processes are fully integrated. Our credit team is directly involved in all due diligence and analysis prior to the formal credit approval process by the Investment Committee. 
Investment Committee 
 The Investment Committee consists of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Investment Officer, and an additional member of the Board of Directors. The Investment Committee serves to provide investment consistency and adherence to our core investment philosophy and policies. 
 Upon completion of the due diligence investigation, the underwriting team of investment professionals/analysts will prepare a credit underwriting memorandum that will summarize the contemplated transaction, present the investment highlights, analyze the risk in the transaction and mitigating factors to those risks, analyze the prospective portfolio’s historical financial statements, financial projections, industry and management team, and will then present this memorandum with its recommendations to the Investment Committee for review and approval. 
 The approval of a majority of the Investment Committee is required for all investments of less than $15 million, and the unanimous approval of the Investment Committee is required for investments of $15 million or greater. 
 Monitoring 
 Our management team has significant experience monitoring credit portfolios. Along with origination and credit analysis, portfolio management is one of the key elements of our business. Most of our investments will not be liquid and, therefore, we must prepare to act quickly if potential issues arise so that we can work closely with management and the private equity sponsor, if applicable, of the portfolio company to take any necessary remedial action. In addition, most of our senior management team, has substantial workout and restructuring experience.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 In order to assist us in detecting issues with our Debt Securities Portfolio companies as early as possible, we perform a financial analysis at least quarterly on each portfolio company. This analysis typically includes: 
 •

 A summary of the portfolio company’s current total credit exposure as well as the KCAP portion of this exposure. 
 ​
 •

 A summary and update of the portfolio company’s financial condition and performance, including but not limited to, performance versus plan, deterioration/improvement in market position, or industry fundamentals, management changes or additions, and ongoing business strategy. 
 ​
 •

 Reaffirmation of, or proposal to change, the risk rating of the underlying investment. 
 ​
 •

 A summary of the portfolio company’s financial covenant results vis a vis financial covenant levels established in the credit agreement. 
 ​
 Watch list credits are followed closely and discussed periodically with the Chief Investment Officer, as appropriate. 
 The Externalization Agreement 
 At a meeting of our Board of Directors held on December 12, 2018, the Board, including all of its independent directors, unanimously voted to approve the Advisory Agreement, contingent upon entering into the Externalization Agreement, obtaining Company stockholder approval of the Advisory Agreement, and closing of the transactions contemplated by the Externalization Agreement, and determined that the Advisory Agreement is in the best interests of us and our stockholders. At the Special Meeting held on February 19, 2019, our stockholders approved the Advisory Agreement. If the transactions contemplated by the Externalization Agreement are completed, upon the Closing, we will commence operations as an externally managed BDC managed by the Adviser. 
 Pursuant to the Externalization Agreement with BCP, the Adviser will become our investment adviser in exchange for a cash payment from BCP, or its affiliate, of $25 million, or approximately $0.67 per share of our common stock, directly to our stockholders. In addition, following the Closing, the Adviser (or its affiliate) will use up to $10 million of the incentive fee actually paid to the Adviser prior to the second anniversary of the Closing date to buy newly issued shares of our common stock at the most recently determined net asset value per share of our common stock at the time of such purchase. For the period of one year from the first day of the first quarter following the quarter in which the Advisory Agreement becomes effective, the Adviser will permanently forego up to the full amount of the incentive fees earned by the Adviser without recourse against or reimbursement by the Company, to the extent necessary in order to achieve aggregate net investment income per common share of the Company for such one-year period to be at least equal to $0.40 per share, subject to certain adjustments. BCP and the Adviser’s total financial commitment to the transactions contemplated by the Externalization Agreement is $35.0 million.
 The Company anticipates that the Closing will occur at the end of the quarter ending March 31, 2019, but the Company will issue a press release announcing the record date and payment date of the stockholding payment.
 About the Adviser 
 At the Closing, the Adviser, an affiliate of BC Partners, will become the investment adviser of the Company. LibreMax intends to own a portion of the Adviser. Subject to the overall supervision of the Board, the Adviser will be responsible for managing the Company’s business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring the Company’s investments, and monitoring the Company’s portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. 
 BC Partners is a leading buyout firm with a 30-year history investing across Europe and North America which had assets under management of over $24 billion as of December 19, 2018. The assets under management for BCP are based on actively managed commitments of its managed funds and

BCP operates a private equity investment platform (“BCP PE”) and a credit investment platform (“BCP Credit”) as fully integrated businesses. The investment activity of the Company will take place primarily within the BCP Credit platform. Integration with the broader BCP platform allows BCP Credit to leverage a team of approximately 60 investment professionals across its private equity platform including an eight-member operations team. The BCP Credit Investment Team (the “Investment Team”) is led by Ted Goldthorpe who sits on both the BCP Credit and BCP PE investment committees. An affiliate of the Adviser currently manages a private BDC, BC Partners Lending Corporation, and a private fund in the BCP Credit platform. BCP intends to offer employment to certain Company employees, including but not limited to, the Company’s executive officers. 
 The Adviser will seek to invest on behalf of the Company in performing, well-established middle market businesses that operate across a wide range of industries (i.e., no concentration in any one industry). The Adviser will employ fundamental credit analysis, targeting investments in businesses with relatively low levels of cyclicality and operating risk. The holding size of each position will generally be dependent upon a number of factors including total facility size, pricing and structure, and the number of other lenders in the facility. The Adviser has experience managing levered vehicles, both public and private, and will seek to enhance the Company’s returns through the use of leverage with a prudent approach that prioritizes capital preservation. The Adviser believes this strategy and approach offers attractive risk/return with lower volatility given the potential for fewer defaults and greater resilience through market cycles. 
 Advisory Agreement 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Company will pay the Adviser (i) a base management fee (the “Base Management Fee”) and (ii) an incentive fee (the “Incentive Fee”). For the period from the date of the Advisory Agreement (the “Effective Date”) through the end of the first calendar quarter after the Effective Date, the Base Management Fee will be calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of the Company’s gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts, as of the end of such calendar quarter. Subsequently, the Base Management Fee will be 1.50% of the Company’s average gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters; provided, however, that the Base Management Fee will be 1.00% of the Company’s average gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts, that exceed the product of (i) 200% and (ii) the value of the Company’s net asset value at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. The Incentive Fee will consist of two parts: (1) a portion based on the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income (the “Income-Based Fee”) and (2) a portion based on the net capital gains received on the Company’s portfolio of securities on a cumulative basis for each calendar year, net of all realized capital losses and all unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, in each case calculated from the Effective Date, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains Incentive Fee (the “Capital Gains Fee”). The Income-Based Fee will be 17.50% of pre-incentive fee net investment income with a 7.00% hurdle rate. The Capital Gains Fee will be 17.50%. For more information regarding the terms of the fee structure under the Advisory Agreement, please see our definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on January 15, 2019. 
DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE 
 We determine the net asset value per share of our common stock quarterly. The net asset value per share is equal to the value of our total assets minus liabilities and any preferred stock outstanding divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Our net asset value per share was $4.23 and $4.87 as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Since we report our assets at fair value for each reporting period, net asset value also represents the amount of stockholders’ equity per share for the reporting period. Our net asset value is comprised mostly of investment assets less debt and other liabilities:

 Our balance sheet at fair value and resultant net asset value are calculated on a basis consistent with GAAP. Our per share presentation of such amounts (other than net asset value per share) is an internally derived non-GAAP performance measure calculated by dividing the applicable balance sheet amount by outstanding shares. We believe that the per share amounts for such balance sheet items are helpful in analyzing our balance sheet both quantitatively and qualitatively.

 Valuation 
 As a BDC, we invest primarily in illiquid securities, including loans to and warrants of private companies and interests in other illiquid securities, such as interests in CLO Fund Securities, joint ventures, partnerships and distressed debt securities. These portfolio investments may be subject to restrictions on resale and will generally have no established trading market. As a result, our Board of Directors determines in good faith the fair value of our portfolio investments pursuant to a valuation policy developed in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820: Fair Value”), and a valuation process approved by our Board of Directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act. Our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio. Our Board of Directors is ultimately and solely responsible for making a good faith determination of the fair value of portfolio investments on a quarterly basis. The Company uses an independent valuation firm to provide third party valuation consulting services to the Company and the Board of Directors. For additional information concerning valuation, see “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Valuation of Portfolio Investments”; and Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Competition 
 Our primary competitors also provide financing to prospective portfolio companies. These include commercial banks, specialty finance companies, hedge funds, structured investment funds, other BDCs and investment banks. Our competitors may have a lower cost of funds, and many have access to funding sources that are not available to us. Many of these entities have greater managerial resources than we have, and the 1940 Act imposes certain regulatory restrictions on us as a BDC to which many of our competitors are not subject. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure — We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.” 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 13 employees, including an experienced team of seven investment professionals. 
 REGULATION 
 The following discussion is a general summary of some of the material prohibitions and restrictions governing BDCs generally. It does not purport to be a complete description of all the laws and regulations affecting BDCs. 
 A BDC is a unique kind of investment company that primarily focuses on investing in or lending to private or relatively small publicly traded companies and making managerial assistance available to them. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their directors and officers and certain other related persons and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. We have implemented certain procedures to ensure that we do not engage in any prohibited transactions with any persons affiliated with us. 
 In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of such company’s shares present at a meeting or represented by proxy if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company are present or represented by proxy or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company. 
 Qualifying Assets 
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, or “Qualifying Assets,” unless, at the time the acquisition is made, Qualifying Assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of Qualifying Assets relevant to our business are the following: 
 •

 Securities of an “eligible portfolio company” purchased in transactions not involving any public offering. An “eligible portfolio company” is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: 
 ​
 (a)

 is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 
 ​
 (b)

 is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 
 ​
 (c)

 satisfies any of the following: 
 ​
 (i)

 does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange (or, if it has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million); 
 ​
 (ii)

 is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; 
 ​

​
  12

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 (iii)

 is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million; or 
 ​
 (iv)

 does not have outstanding any class of securities with respect to which a broker or dealer may extend margin credit. 
 ​
 •

 Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control; 
 ​
 •

 Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company and is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization; 
 ​
 •

 Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the conversion of warrants or rights relating to such securities; and 
 ​
 •

 Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 
 ​
 Significant Managerial Assistance 
 A BDC must be organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above. In addition, BDCs must generally offer to make available to such issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where we purchase such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons is the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company through monitoring of portfolio company operations, selective participation in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising a portfolio company’s officers or other organizational or financial guidance. 
Temporary Investments 
 Pending investment in other types of “Qualifying Assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that at least 70% of our assets are “Qualifying Assets.” Typically, we invest in U.S. treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements that are treated, under applicable tax rules, as being issued by a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests imposed on us by the Code to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements treated as issued, under applicable tax rules, by a single counterparty in excess of this limit. We monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
Indebtedness; Coverage Ratio 
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% (or 150% effective as of March 29, 2019) immediately after each such issuance. In addition, with respect to certain types of senior securities, we must make provisions to prohibit any dividend distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of certain of our securities, unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. As noted above, on March 29, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, 

 13

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 as amended by the SBCA. As a result, our asset coverage requirement for senior securities will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective as of March 29, 2019. However, despite the SBCA, we will continue to be prohibited by the indentures governing our 6.125% Notes (as defined and discussed in Note 6 — “Borrowings” below) from making distributions on our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, falls below 200%. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary purposes. For a discussion of the risks associated with the resulting leverage, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure — We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.” As of December 31, 2018, our asset coverage ratio was 249%, above the minimum required asset coverage level of 200%. 
Common Stock 
 We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our common stock is to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such common stock (less any distributing commission or discount). We may also make rights offerings to our stockholders at prices per share less than the net asset value per share, subject to applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital.” 
Code of Ethics 
 We adopted and maintain a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. A copy of the code of ethics is available on the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website at http://www.kcapfinancial.com. Our code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. Copies may be obtained by electronic request to publicinfo@sec.gov 
 Privacy Principles 
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
 Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although some non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as is necessary to service stockholder accounts, such as to a transfer agent, or as otherwise permitted by law. 
 We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to our employees with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders. 
 Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures 
 Although the securities we hold are not typically voting securities, some of our investments could entitle us to voting rights. If this were to occur we would vote our portfolio securities in the best interest of our stockholders and we would review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although we would generally vote against proposals that we believe may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if we were to believe there exists a compelling long-term reason to do so. 

 14

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Our voting decisions would be made by our Investment Committee. To ensure that our vote would not the product of a conflict of interest, we would require that (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 
Other 
 We are subject to examination by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 
 We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from indemnifying any director or officer against any liability to our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office. 
 We are required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and to review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We have a designated Chief Compliance Officer who is responsible for administering these policies and procedures. 
 TAXATION AS A REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANY 
 We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a Regulated Investment Company (“RIC”) under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and intend to operate in a manner to maintain our RIC tax treatment. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary taxable income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). 
 Taxation as a RIC 
 For any taxable year in which we qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain, defined as net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses, we distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any net ordinary income or net capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 
 We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on our undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (a) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (b) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (c) any income or gains realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”). For this purpose, however, any net ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year will be considered to have been distributed by year end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). Although we generally endeavor to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may incur a U.S. federal excise tax. 
 To qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 
 •

 qualify to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 
 ​
 •

 derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other 
 ​

​
  15

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, and net income derived from interests in “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (which generally are partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive 90% of their income from interest, dividends and other permitted RIC income) (the “90% Income Test”); and 
 •

 diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 
 ​
 ◦

 at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 
 ​
 ◦

 no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the “Diversification Tests”). 
 ​
 If we do not satisfy the requirements of the Diversification Tests as of the end of any quarter, we will not lose our status as RIC provided that (i) we satisfied the requirements in a prior quarter and (ii) our failure to satisfy the requirements in the current quarter is not due in whole or in part to an acquisition of any security or other property. 
 We may invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which may result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income, franchise or withholding liabilities. 
 We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. If we are not able to obtain sufficient cash from other sources to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify as a RIC and become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on all of our taxable income without the benefit of the dividends-paid deduction. 
 Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order (i) to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and to otherwise eliminate our liability for U.S. federal income and excise taxes and (ii) to satisfy the Diversification Tests. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to borrow additional funds or to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless a certain “asset coverage” test is met. See “Regulation — Indebtedness; Coverage Ratio.” Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement or the Diversification Tests may be limited by (a) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (b) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, or the Diversification Tests, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 
 Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (a) treat dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income as non-qualified dividend income, (b) treat dividends that would otherwise be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction as ineligible for such treatment, (c) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (d) convert lower-taxed long-term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (e) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (f) cause us to recognize income or gain

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 without a corresponding receipt of cash, (g) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (h) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (i) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We intend to monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these provisions and prevent our disqualification as a RIC. 
 Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such capital gain or loss generally will be long- term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. 
 Some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not satisfy the 90% Income Test. In order to ensure that such income and fees do not disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may hold assets that generate such income and provide services that generate such fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will be required to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees. 
 Failure to Qualify as a Regulated Investment Company 
 If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions made would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income that, subject to certain limitations, may be eligible for the 20.0% maximum rate to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five years. 
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN 
 We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash as provided below. As a result, if our Board of Directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash distribution, then our stockholders who have not “opted out” of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash. 
 No action is required on the part of a registered stockholder to have such shareholder’s cash distribution reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered stockholder may elect to receive an entire distribution in cash by notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the plan administrator and our transfer agent and registrar, in writing so that such notice is received by the plan administrator no later than the record date for distributions to stockholders. The plan administrator will set up an account for shares acquired through the plan for each stockholder who has not elected to receive distributions in cash and hold such shares in non-certificated form. Upon request by a stockholder participating in the plan, received in writing not less than ten days prior to the record date, the plan administrator will, instead of crediting shares to the participant’s account, issue a certificate registered in the participant’s name for the number of whole shares of our common stock and a check for any fractional share. 
 Those stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive distributions in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election. 
 We intend to use primarily newly issued shares to implement the plan, whether our shares are trading at a premium or at a discount to net asset value. However, we reserve the right to purchase shares in the open market in connection with our implementation of the plan. The number of shares to be issued to a stockholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to such stockholder

 by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on the dividend payment date. Market price per share on that date will be the closing price for such shares on The NASDAQ Global Select Market or, if no sale is reported for such day, at the average of their reported bid and asked prices. Shares purchased in open market transactions by the plan administrator of the dividend reinvestment plan will be allocated to a stockholder based upon the average purchase price, excluding any brokerage charges or other charges, of all shares of common stock purchased with respect to the distribution. 
 There are no brokerage charges or other charges to stockholders who participate in the plan. The plan administrator’s fees under the plan are paid by us. If a participant elects by written notice to the plan administrator to have the plan administrator sell part or all of the shares held by the plan administrator in the participant’s account and remit the proceeds to the participant, the plan administrator is authorized to deduct a $15.00 transaction fee plus a $0.10 per share brokerage commission from the proceeds. 
 If your distributions are reinvested, you will be required to pay tax on the distributions in the same manner as if the distributions were received in cash. The taxation of distributions will not be affected by the form in which you receive them. 
 Participants may terminate their accounts under the plan by notifying the plan administrator via its website at www.amstock.com, by filling out the transaction request form located at bottom of their statement and sending it to the plan administrator at the address set forth below or by calling the plan administrator at 1-866-668-8564. 
 The plan may be terminated by us upon notice in writing mailed to each participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of any dividend by us. All correspondence concerning the plan should be directed to, and additional information about the plan may be obtained from, the plan administrator by mail at American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, Attn. Dividend Reinvestment Department, P.O. Box 922, Wall Street Station, New York, NY 10269-0560 or by telephone at 1-866-668-8564.
