Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Introduction
 
Coca‑Cola Consolidated, Inc. (formerly Coca‑Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated), a Delaware corporation (together with its majority-owned subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), distributes, markets and manufactures nonalcoholic beverages in territories spanning 14 states and the District of Columbia. The Company was incorporated in 1980 and, together with its predecessors, has been in the nonalcoholic beverage manufacturing and distribution business since 1902. We are the largest Coca‑Cola bottler in the United States. Approximately 88% of our total bottle/can sales volume to retail customers consists of products of The Coca‑Cola Company, which include some of the most recognized and popular beverage brands in the world. We also distribute products for several other beverage companies, including BA Sports Nutrition, LLC (“BodyArmor”), Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (“Dr Pepper”) and Monster Energy Company (“Monster Energy”). Our purpose is to honor God, to serve others, to pursue excellence and to grow profitably. Our stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “COKE.”
Ownership
 
As of December 30, 2018, The Coca‑Cola Company owned approximately 27% of the Company’s total outstanding Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a consolidated basis, representing approximately 5% of the total voting power of the Company’s Common Stock and Class B Common Stock voting together. As long as The Coca‑Cola Company holds the number of shares of Common Stock it currently owns, it has the right to have its designee proposed by the Company for nomination to the Company’s Board of Directors, and J. Frank Harrison, III, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and trustees of certain trusts established for the benefit of certain relatives of J. Frank Harrison, Jr. have agreed to vote the shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock which they control, representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company’s combined Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, in favor of such designee. The Coca‑Cola Company does not own any shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock.
Beverage Products
 
We offer a range of nonalcoholic beverage products and flavors designed to meet the demands of our consumers,
 including both sparkling and still beverages. Sparkling beverages are carbonated beverages and the Company’s principal sparkling beverage is Coca‑Cola.
 Still beverages include energy products and noncarbonated beverages such as bottled water, tea, ready to drink coffee, enhanced water, juices and sports drinks.
 
Our sales are divided into two main categories: (i) bottle/can sales and (ii) other sales. Bottle/can sales include products packaged primarily in plastic bottles and aluminum cans. Other sales include sales to other Coca‑Cola bottlers, “post-mix” products, transportation revenue and equipment maintenance revenue. Post-mix products are dispensed through equipment that mixes fountain syrups with carbonated or still water, enabling fountain retailers to sell finished products to consumers in cups or glasses.
 
Bottle/can sales represented approximately 84% of total net sales for each of fiscal 2018 (“2018”), fiscal 2017 (“2017”) and fiscal 2016 (“2016”). The sparkling beverage category represented approximately 62%, 63% and 66% of total bottle/can sales during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
The following table sets forth some of our principal products, including products of The Coca‑Cola Company and products licensed to us by other beverage companies.

System Transformation
 
As part of The Coca‑Cola Company’s plans to refranchise its North American bottling territories, we completed a series of transactions from April 2013 to October 2017 with The Coca‑Cola Company, Coca‑Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (“CCR”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Coca‑Cola Company, and Coca‑Cola Bottling Company United, Inc. (“United”), an independent bottler that is unrelated to us, to significantly expand our distribution and manufacturing operations (the “System Transformation”). The System Transformation included the acquisition and exchange of rights to serve distribution territories and related distribution assets, as well as the acquisition and exchange of regional manufacturing facilities and related manufacturing assets. Final post-closing adjustments in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable asset purchase agreement or asset exchange agreement have been completed for all System Transformation transactions.
 
Following the completion of the System Transformation, we are party to several key agreements that (i) provide us with rights to distribute, market and manufacture beverage products and (ii) coordinate our role in the North American Coca‑Cola system. The following sections summarize certain of these key agreements.
 
Beverage Distribution and Manufacturing Agreements
 
We have rights to distribute, promote, market and sell certain nonalcoholic beverages of The Coca‑Cola Company pursuant to a comprehensive beverage agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR. We also have rights to manufacture, produce and package certain beverages bearing trademarks of The Coca‑Cola Company pursuant to a regional manufacturing agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company. These agreements, which are the principal agreements we have with The Coca‑Cola Company and its affiliates following completion of the System Transformation, are described below under the headings “Distribution Agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR” and “Manufacturing Agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company.”
 
In addition to our agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR, we also have rights to manufacture and/or distribute certain beverage brands owned by other beverage companies, including Dr Pepper and Monster Energy, pursuant to agreements with such other beverage companies. Certain of these agreements are described below under the heading “Distribution Agreements with Other Beverage Companies.”
 
Distribution Agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR
 
We have exclusive rights to distribute, promote, market and sell certain beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company in specific geographic territories pursuant to a comprehensive beverage agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR entered into on March 31, 2017 (as amended, the “CBA”), in exchange for which we are required to make quarterly sub-bottling payments to CCR. The amount of these payments is based on gross profit derived from our sales of beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company as well as certain cross-licensed beverage brands not owned or licensed by The Coca‑Cola Company. These sub-bottling payments to CCR are for the territories we acquired in the System Transformation and are not applicable to those territories we served prior to the System Transformation or to those territories we acquired in an exchange transaction. Since March 31, 2017, we have entered into a series of amendments to the CBA with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR to add or remove, as applicable, all territories we acquired or exchanged after that date in the System Transformation.
 
The CBA contains provisions that apply in the event of a potential sale of our company or our aggregate businesses related to the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company. Pursuant to the CBA, we may only sell our distribution business to either The Coca‑Cola Company or third-party buyers approved by The Coca‑Cola Company. We may obtain a list of approved third-party buyers from The Coca‑Cola Company on an annual basis or can seek The Coca‑Cola Company’s approval of a potential buyer upon receipt of a third-party offer to purchase our distribution business. If we wish to sell our distribution business to The Coca‑Cola Company and are unable to agree with The Coca‑Cola Company on the terms of a binding purchase and sale agreement, including the purchase price for our distribution business, the CBA provides that we may either withdraw from negotiations or initiate a third-party valuation process to determine the purchase price and, upon this determination, opt to continue with our potential sale to The Coca‑Cola Company. If we elect to continue with our potential sale, The Coca‑Cola Company will then have the option to (i) purchase our distribution business at the purchase price determined by the third-party valuation process and pursuant to the sale terms set forth in the CBA (including, to the extent not otherwise agreed to by us and The Coca‑Cola Company, default non-price terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement), or (ii) elect not to purchase our distribution business, in which case the CBA will be automatically amended to, among other things, permit us to sell our distribution business to any third party without obtaining The Coca‑Cola Company’s prior approval.

The CBA further provides:
 
 
• | the right of The Coca‑Cola Company to terminate the CBA in the event of an uncured default by us, in which case The Coca‑Cola Company (or its designee) is required to acquire our distribution business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the requirement that we maintain an annual equivalent case volume per capita change rate that is not less than one standard deviation below the median of the rates for all U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers for the same period; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the requirement that we make minimum, ongoing capital expenditures in our distribution business at a specified level.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The CBA prohibits us from producing, manufacturing, preparing, packaging, distributing, selling, dealing in or otherwise using or handling any beverages, beverage components or other beverage products (i) other than the beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company and expressly permitted cross-licensed brands and (ii) unless otherwise consented to by The Coca‑Cola Company. The CBA has a term of ten years and is renewable by us indefinitely for successive additional terms of ten years, unless earlier terminated as provided therein.
 
As part of the System Transformation, on March 31, 2017, each of our then-existing bottling agreements for The Coca‑Cola Company beverage brands was automatically amended, restated and converted into the CBA (the “Bottling Agreement Conversion”), pursuant to a territory conversion agreement we entered into with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR on September 23, 2015. The Bottling Agreement Conversion included, subject to certain limited exceptions, all of our then-existing comprehensive beverage agreements, master bottle contracts, allied bottle contracts and other bottling agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company or CCR that authorized us to produce and/or distribute beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company in all territories where we (or one of our affiliates) had rights to market, promote, distribute and sell beverage products owned or licensed by The Coca‑Cola Company.
 
In connection with the Bottling Agreement Conversion, each then-existing bottling agreement for The Coca‑Cola Company beverage brands between The Coca‑Cola Company and certain of our subsidiaries, including Piedmont Coca‑Cola Bottling Partnership, a partnership formed by us and The Coca‑Cola Company, was also amended, restated and converted into a comprehensive beverage agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company, pursuant to which the subsidiary was granted certain exclusive rights to distribute, promote, market and sell certain beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company in certain territories. These comprehensive beverage agreements are substantially similar to the CBA and, as with the treatment of the territories served by the Company prior to the System Transformation under the CBA, do not require our subsidiaries to make quarterly sub-bottling payments to CCR.
 
Manufacturing Agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company
 
We have rights to manufacture, produce and package certain beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company at our manufacturing plants pursuant to a regional manufacturing agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company entered into on March 31, 2017 (as amended, the “RMA”). These beverages may be distributed by us for our own account in accordance with the CBA, or may be sold by us to certain other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers and to the Coca‑Cola North America division of The Coca‑Cola Company (“CCNA”) in accordance with the RMA. Pursuant to the RMA, the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, that the Company charges for these sales to CCNA or other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers are unilaterally established by CCNA from time to time. Since March 31, 2017, we entered into a series of amendments to the RMA with The Coca‑Cola Company to add or remove, as applicable, all regional manufacturing facilities we acquired or exchanged after that date in the System Transformation.
 
Under the RMA, our aggregate business primarily related to the manufacture of certain beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company and permitted third-party beverage products is subject to the same agreed upon sale process provisions in the CBA, including the obligation to obtain The Coca‑Cola Company’s prior approval of a potential purchaser of our manufacturing business and provisions for the sale of such business to The Coca‑Cola Company. The RMA requires that we make minimum, ongoing capital expenditures in our manufacturing business at a specified level. The Coca‑Cola Company has the right to terminate the RMA in the event of an uncured default by us under the CBA or in the event of an uncured breach of our material obligations under the RMA or the NPSG Governance Agreement (as defined below).
 
The RMA prohibits us from manufacturing any beverages, beverage components or other beverage products (i) other than the beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company and certain expressly permitted cross‑licensed brands, and (ii) unless otherwise consented to by The Coca‑Cola Company. Subject to The Coca‑Cola Company’s termination rights, the RMA has a term that continues for the duration of the term of the CBA.
 
As part of the System Transformation and concurrent with the Bottling Agreement Conversion, on March 31, 2017, each of our then-existing manufacturing agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company was amended, restated and converted into the RMA.

Finished Goods Supply Arrangements
 
We have finished goods supply arrangements with other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers to buy and sell finished products produced under trademarks owned by The Coca‑Cola Company in accordance with the RMA, pursuant to which the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished products are unilaterally established by CCNA from time to time. In most instances, the Company’s ability to negotiate the prices at which it purchases finished goods bearing trademarks owned by The Coca‑Cola Company from, and the prices at which it sells such finished goods to, other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers is limited pursuant to these pricing provisions.
Manufacturing and/or Distribution Agreements with Other Beverage Companies
 
In addition to our distribution and manufacturing agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company, we also have manufacturing and/or distribution agreements with other beverage companies, including Dr Pepper and Monster Energy.
 
Our distribution agreements with Dr Pepper permit us to distribute Dr Pepper beverage brands, as well as certain post-mix products of Dr Pepper. Certain of our agreements with Dr Pepper also authorize us to manufacture certain Dr Pepper beverage brands. Our distribution agreement with Monster Energy grants us the rights to distribute certain products offered, packaged and/or marketed by Monster Energy.
 
Under our distribution agreements with other beverage companies, the price for syrup, concentrate or finished products is set by the beverage company from time to time. Similar to the CBA, these beverage agreements contain restrictions on the use of trademarks, approved bottles, cans and labels and sale of imitations or substitutes, as well as termination for cause provisions. The territories covered by beverage agreements with other beverage companies are not always aligned with the territories covered by the CBA, but are generally within those territory boundaries.
 
Sales of beverages under these agreements with other beverage companies represented approximately 12%, 7% and 10% of our bottle/can sales volume to retail customers for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Other Agreements related to the Coca‑Cola System
 
As part of the System Transformation process, we entered into agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company, CCR and other Coca‑Cola bottlers regarding product supply, information technology services and other aspects of the North American Coca‑Cola system, as described below. Many of these agreements involve new system governance structures providing for greater participation and involvement by bottlers, which require increased demands on the Company’s management and more collaboration and alignment by the participating bottlers in order to successfully implement Coca‑Cola system plans and strategies. 
 
Incidence-Based Pricing Agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company
 
The Company has incidence-based pricing agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company, which establish the prices charged by The Coca‑Cola Company to the Company for (i) concentrates of sparkling and certain still beverages produced by the Company and (ii) certain purchased still beverages. Under the incidence-based pricing agreements, the prices charged by The Coca‑Cola Company are impacted by a number of factors, including the incidence rate in effect, our pricing and sales of finished products, the channels in which the finished products are sold and package mix and in the case of products sold by The Coca‑Cola Company to us in finished form, the cost of goods for certain elements used in such products. The Coca‑Cola Company has no rights under the incidence-based pricing agreements to establish the resale prices at which we sell products, but does have the right to establish certain pricing under other agreements, including the RMA.
 
National Product Supply Governance Agreement
 
We are a member of a national product supply group (the “NPSG”), comprised of The Coca‑Cola Company and certain other Coca‑Cola bottlers who are regional producing bottlers in The Coca‑Cola Company’s national product supply system (collectively with the Company, the “NPSG Members”), pursuant to a national product supply governance agreement executed in October 2015 with The Coca‑Cola Company and certain other Coca‑Cola bottlers (as amended, the “NPSG Governance Agreement”). The stated objectives of the NPSG include, among others, (i) Coca‑Cola system strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning; (ii) network optimization of plant to distribution center sourcing; and (iii) new product/packaging infrastructure planning.
 
Under the NPSG Governance Agreement, the NPSG Members established certain governance mechanisms, including a governing board (the “NPSG Board”) comprised of representatives of certain NPSG Members. The NPSG Board makes and/or oversees and directs certain key decisions regarding the NPSG, including decisions regarding the management and staffing of the NPSG and the 
 6


funding for its ongoing operations. Pursuant to the decisions of the NPSG Board made from time to time and subject to the terms and conditions of the NPSG Governance Agreement, each NPSG Member is required to make certain investments in its respective manufacturing assets and implement Coca‑Cola system strategic investment opportunities consistent with the NPSG Governance Agreement. We are also obligated to pay a certain portion of the costs of operating the NPSG.
 
CONA Services LLC
 
We are a member of CONA Services LLC (“CONA”), an entity formed with The Coca‑Cola Company and certain other Coca‑Cola bottlers to provide business process and information technology services to its members.
 
We are party to a master services agreement with CONA (the “CONA MSA”), pursuant to which CONA agreed to make available, and we became authorized to use, the Coke One North America system (the “CONA System”), a uniform information technology system developed to promote operational efficiency and uniformity among North American Coca‑Cola bottlers. As part of making the CONA System available to us, CONA provides us with certain business process and information technology services, including the planning, development, management and operation of the CONA System in connection with our direct store delivery and manufacture of products.
 
We are authorized under the CONA MSA to use the CONA System in connection with our distribution, promotion, marketing, sale and manufacture of beverages we are authorized to distribute or manufacture under the CBA, the RMA or any other agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company, subject to the provisions of the CONA operating agreement and any licenses or other agreements relating to products or services provided by third parties and used in connection with the CONA System. In exchange for our rights to use the CONA System and receive CONA-related services under the CONA MSA, we are charged service fees by CONA. We are obligated to pay the service fees under the CONA MSA even if we are not using the CONA System for all or any portion of our distribution and manufacturing operations.
 
Amended and Restated Ancillary Business Letter
 
As part of the System Transformation, we entered into an amended and restated ancillary business letter with The Coca‑Cola Company on March 31, 2017 (the “Ancillary Business Letter”), pursuant to which we were granted advance waivers to acquire or develop certain lines of business involving the preparation, distribution, sale, dealing in or otherwise using or handling of certain beverage products that would otherwise be prohibited under the CBA or any similar agreement.
 
Under the Ancillary Business Letter, subject to certain limited exceptions, we are prohibited from acquiring or developing any line of business inside or outside of our territories governed by the CBA or any similar agreement prior to January 1, 2020 without the consent of The Coca‑Cola Company, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. After January 1, 2020, The Coca‑Cola Company would be required to consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld) to our acquisition or development of (i) any grocery, quick service restaurant, or convenience and petroleum store business engaged in the sale of beverages, beverage components and other beverage products not otherwise authorized or permitted by the CBA, or (ii) any other line of business for which beverage activities otherwise prohibited under the CBA represent more than a certain threshold of net sales (subject to certain limited exceptions).

Markets Served and Facilities
 
As of December 30, 2018, we served approximately 66 million consumers within our territories, which comprised 7 principal markets. Certain information regarding each of these markets follows:
 
 
Market | Description | Approximate Population | Manufacturing Plants | Number of Distribution Centers
-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------

Raw Materials
 
In addition to concentrates purchased from The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies for use in our beverage manufacturing, we also purchase sweetener, carbon dioxide, plastic bottles, cans, closures and other packaging materials, as well as equipment for the distribution, marketing and production of nonalcoholic beverages.
 
We purchase all of our plastic bottles from Southeastern Container and Western Container, two manufacturing cooperatives we co-own with several other Coca‑Cola bottlers, and all of our aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers.
 
Along with all other Coca‑Cola bottlers in the United States, we are a member of Coca-Cola Bottlers’ Sales & Services Company, LLC (“CCBSS”), which was formed in 2003 to provide certain procurement and other services with the intention of enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of the Coca‑Cola bottling system in the United States. CCBSS negotiates the procurement for the majority of our raw materials, excluding concentrate, and we receive a rebate from CCBSS for the purchase of these raw materials.
 
We are exposed to price risk on commodities such as aluminum, corn, PET resin (a petroleum- or plant-based product), and fuel, which affects the cost of raw materials used in the production of our finished products. Examples of the raw materials affected include aluminum cans and plastic bottles used for packaging and high fructose corn syrup used as a product ingredient. Further, we are exposed to commodity price risk on oil, which impacts our cost of fuel used in the movement and delivery of our products. We participate in commodity hedging and risk mitigation programs, including programs administered by CCBSS and programs we administer. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. 
 
Customers and Marketing
 
The Company’s products are sold and distributed through various channels, which include selling directly to retail stores and other outlets such as food markets, institutional accounts and vending machine outlets. All the Company’s beverage sales were to customers in the United States.
 
The following table summarizes the percentage of the Company’s total bottle/can sales volume to its largest customers, as well as the percentage of the Company’s total net sales that such volume represents:
 
 
 | Fiscal Year | 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------+---
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
Approximate percent of the Company’s total bottle/can sales volume | | | | | | | | 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. | | 19 | % | | 19 | % | 20 | %
The Kroger Company | | 11 | % | | 10 | % | 6 | %
Total approximate percent of the Company’s total bottle/can sales volume | | 30 | % | | 29 | % | 26 | %
Approximate percent of the Company’s total net sales | | | | | | | | 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. | | 14 | % | | 13 | % | 14 | %
The Kroger Company | | 8 | % | | 7 | % | 5 | %
Total approximate percent of the Company’s total net sales | | 22 | % | | 20 | % | 19 | %

 
The loss of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or The Kroger Company as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company. No other customer represented greater than 10% of the Company’s total net sales.
 
New product introductions, packaging changes and sales promotions are the primary sales and marketing practices in the nonalcoholic beverage industry and have required, and are expected to continue to require, substantial expenditures. Recent brand introductions include BodyArmor, McCafé® and Hubert’s Lemonade. Recent product introductions in our business include new flavor varieties within certain brands such as Tum-E Yummies Big Berry Blast, Diet Coke Feisty
 Cherry, Fanta Green Apple, Tum-E Yummies Fruit Punch Party, Minute Maid Kiwi Strawberry, Diet Coke Ginger Lime and Diet Coke Blood Orange. Recent packaging introductions include 24 packs of 12‑ounce Minute Maid Juice to go, 25.4‑ounce bottles for Monster Hydro, 16‑ounce bottles for BodyArmor, 13.7‑ounce glass bottles for Monster Caffe and 16‑ounce glass bottles for Hubert’s Lemonade.
 
We sell our products primarily in non-refillable bottles and cans, in varying package configurations from market to market. For example, there may be as many as 30 different packages for Diet Coke within a single geographic area. Bottle/can sales volume to retail customers during 2018 was approximately 52% bottles and 48% cans.

We rely extensively on advertising in various media outlets, primarily online, television and radio, for the marketing of our products. The Coca‑Cola Company, Monster Energy and Dr Pepper make substantial expenditures on advertising programs in our territories from which we benefit. Although The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have provided us with marketing funding support in the past, our beverage agreements generally do not obligate such funding.
 
We also expend substantial funds on our own behalf for extensive local sales promotions of our products. Historically, these expenses have been partially offset by marketing funding support provided to us by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies in support of a variety of marketing programs, such as point-of-sale displays and merchandising programs. We consider the funds we expend for marketing and merchandising programs necessary to maintain or increase revenue.
 
In addition to our marketing and merchandising programs, we believe a sustained and planned charitable giving program to support communities is an essential component to the success of our brand and, by extension, our sales. In 2018, the Company made cash donations of approximately $4.9 million to various charities and donor-advised funds in light of the Company’s financial performance, distribution territory footprint and future business prospects. The Company intends to continue its charitable contributions in future years, subject to the Company’s financial performance and other business factors.
 
Seasonality
 
Business seasonality results primarily from higher unit sales of the Company’s products in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. We believe that we and other manufacturers from whom we purchase finished products have adequate production capacity to meet sales demand for sparkling and still beverages during these peak periods. See “Item 2. Properties” for information relating to utilization of our manufacturing plants. Sales volume can also be impacted by weather conditions. Fixed costs, such as depreciation expense, are not significantly impacted by business seasonality.
Competition
 
The nonalcoholic beverage market is highly competitive for both sparkling and still beverages. Our competitors include bottlers and distributors of nationally and regionally advertised and marketed products, as well as bottlers and distributors of private label beverages. Our principal competitors include local bottlers of PepsiCo, Inc. products and, in some regions, local bottlers of Dr Pepper products.
 
The principal methods of competition in the nonalcoholic beverage industry are point-of-sale merchandising, new product introductions, new vending and dispensing equipment, packaging changes, pricing, price promotions, product quality, retail space management, customer service, frequency of distribution and advertising. We believe we are competitive in our territories with respect to these methods of competition.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our businesses are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies of the United States, including laws and regulations governing the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, packaging, labeling, content, quality and safety of our products, our occupational health and safety practices, and the transportation and use of many of our products.
 
We are required to comply with a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act; and laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools.
 
As a manufacturer, distributor and seller of beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies in exclusive territories, we are subject to antitrust laws of general applicability. However, pursuant to the United States Soft Drink Interbrand Competition Act, soft drink bottlers, such as us, are permitted to have exclusive rights to manufacture, distribute and sell a soft drink product in a defined geographic territory if that soft drink product is in substantial and effective competition with other products of the same general class in the market. We believe such competition exists in each of the exclusive geographic territories in the United States in which we operate.

In response to the growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns of today’s youth, a number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. Restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on our products, image and reputation.
 
Most beverage products sold by the Company are classified as food or food products and are therefore eligible for purchase using supplemental nutrition assistance (“SNAP”) benefits by consumers purchasing them for home consumption. Energy drinks with a nutrition facts label are also classified as food and are eligible for purchase for home consumption using SNAP benefits, whereas energy drinks classified as a supplement by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) are not. Regulators may restrict the use of benefit programs, including SNAP, to purchase certain beverages and foods.
 
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed, or are considering imposing, taxes, labeling requirements or other limitations on, or regulations pertaining to, the sale of certain of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the manufacture of our products, including certain of our products that contain added sugars or sodium, exceed a specified caloric content, or include specified ingredients such as caffeine.
 
Legislation has been proposed in Congress and by certain state and local governments which would prohibit the sale of soft drink products in non-refillable bottles and cans or require a mandatory deposit as a means of encouraging the return of such containers, each in an attempt to reduce solid waste and litter. Similarly, we are aware of legislation that would impose fees or taxes on various types of containers that are used in our business. We are currently not impacted by these types of proposed legislation, but it is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted within our territories in the future.
 
We are also subject to federal and local environmental laws, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. Our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated on-site and sent to third-party owned and operated off-site licensed facilities.
 
Environmental Remediation
 
We do not currently have any material commitments for environmental compliance or environmental remediation for any of our properties. We do not believe compliance with enacted or adopted federal, state and local provisions pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or our competitive position.
