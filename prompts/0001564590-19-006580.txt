Overview
 We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing first-in-class muscle activators and best-in-class muscle inhibitors as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which muscle performance is compromised and/or declining. We have discovered and are developing muscle-directed investigational medicines that may potentially improve the healthspan of people with devastating cardiovascular and neuromuscular diseases of impaired muscle function. Our research and development activities relating to the biology of muscle function have evolved from our knowledge and expertise regarding the cytoskeleton, a complex biological infrastructure that plays a fundamental role within every human cell. As a leader in muscle biology and the mechanics of muscle performance, we are developing small molecule drug candidates specifically engineered to impact muscle function and contractility. 
 Our drug candidates currently in clinical development are: omecamtiv mecarbil, a novel cardiac myosin activator which we are developing for the potential treatment of heart failure, reldesemtiv, a novel fast skeletal muscle troponin activator (“FSTA”) which we are developing for the potential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”), CK-3773274 (“CK-274”), a novel cardiac myosin inhibitor, which we are developing for the potential treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (“HCM”) and AMG 594, a novel cardiac troponin activator which is the subject of a Phase 1 clinical study.
 Omecamtiv mecarbil is being evaluated for the potential treatment of heart failure under a strategic alliance with Amgen established in 2006 to discover, develop, and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics designed to activate cardiac muscle contractility pursuant to the collaboration and option agreement dated December 29, 2006, as amended (the “Amgen Agreement”). Amgen, in collaboration with Cytokinetics, is conducting GALACTIC-HF (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure), a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil in heart failure. In collaboration with Amgen, we are conducting METEORIC-HF (Multicenter Exercise Tolerance Evaluation of Omecamtiv Mecarbil Related to Increased Contractility in Heart Failure), a second Phase 3 clinical trial intended to evaluate its potential to increase exercise performance.
 Reldesemtiv selectively activates the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex in the sarcomere by increasing its sensitivity to calcium, leading to an increase in skeletal muscle contractility. Cytokinetics and Astellas are developing reldesemtiv under the Amended and Restated License and Collaboration Agreement dated December 22, 2014, as amended (the “Astellas Agreement”). Astellas holds an exclusive license to develop and commercialize reldesemtiv worldwide, subject to our development and commercialization participation rights. In collaboration with Astellas, we conducted a Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with SMA and we are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with ALS, called FORTITUDE-ALS (Functional Outcomes in a Randomized Trial of Investigational Treatment with CK-2127107 to Understand Decline in Endpoints – in ALS). Astellas, in collaboration with us, conducted a Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”) and a Phase 1b clinical trial of reldesemtiv in elderly subjects with limited mobility. 
 CK-274 is a novel, oral, small molecule cardiac myosin inhibitor that we discovered independent of our collaborations. CK-274 arose from an extensive chemical optimization program conducted with careful attention to therapeutic index and pharmacokinetic properties that may translate into best-in-class potential in clinical development. CK-274 was designed to reduce the hypercontractility that is associated with HCM. In preclinical models, CK-274 reduces myocardial contractility by binding directly to cardiac myosin at a distinct and selective allosteric binding site, thereby preventing myosin from entering a force producing state. CK-274 reduces the number of active actin-myosin cross bridges during each cardiac cycle and consequently reduces myocardial contractility. This mechanism of action may be therapeutically effective in conditions characterized by excessive hypercontractility, such as HCM. We are conducting a Phase 1 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-part, single and multiple ascending dose clinical trial of CK-274 in healthy adult subjects.
 AMG 594 was discovered under our joint research program with Amgen. In collaboration with Cytokinetics, Amgen is conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single and multiple ascending dose, single-center Phase 1 study to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AMG 594 in healthy subjects.
 Our research continues to drive innovation and leadership in muscle biology, evidenced by three new muscle biology directed compounds advancing from research to development in 2018. All of our drug candidates have arisen from our cytoskeletal research activities. Our focus on the biology of the cytoskeleton distinguishes us from other biopharmaceutical companies, and potentially positions us to discover and develop novel therapeutics that may be useful for the treatment of severe diseases and medical conditions. Each of our drug candidates has a novel mechanism of action compared to currently marketed drugs, which we believe validates our focus on the cytoskeleton as a productive area for drug discovery and development. We intend to leverage our experience in muscle contractility to expand our current pipeline and expect to identify additional potential drug candidates that may be suitable for clinical development.

Corporate Strategy 
 We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing first-in-class muscle activators and best-in-class muscle inhibitors as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which muscle performance is compromised and/or declining. As a leader in muscle biology and the mechanics of muscle performance, we are developing small molecule drug candidates specifically engineered to impact muscle function and contractility. Our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize novel drug products that modulate muscle function that may benefit people living with serious diseases or medical conditions, with the intent of establishing a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company. 
 The key components of our Corporate Strategy are: 
  
• | Progress proprietary research programs focused on muscle into development. We believe that our extensive understanding of muscle biology and our proprietary research technologies should enable us to discover and potentially to develop drug candidates with novel mechanisms of action that may offer potential benefits not provided by existing drugs and which may have application across a broad array of diseases and medical conditions. We expect that we may be able to leverage our expertise in muscle contractility to expand programs related to other areas of muscle function and which may extend to the potential treatment of other serious medical diseases and conditions. Progressing related programs in parallel may afford us an opportunity to build a broader business that could benefit from multiple products that serve related clinical and commercial needs associated with impaired muscle function, muscle weakness and fatigue. In addition, this strategy may enable us to diversify certain technical, financial and operating risks by advancing several drug candidates in parallel.

• | Advance next-generation skeletal and cardiac muscle-directed compounds into clinical development. We take a purpose-driven approach by leveraging our extensive muscle biology expertise to engineer compounds with specific characteristics aimed at treating diseases that impact muscle function. By increasing muscle strength and performance, our drug candidates may preserve and extend independence and self-reliance in people suffering from debilitating diseases. We have established select strategic alliances to support certain drug development programs while preserving significant development and commercialization rights. We believe that such alliances may allow us to obtain financial support and to capitalize on the therapeutic area expertise and resources of our partners that can potentially accelerate the development and commercialization of our drug candidates. Where we deem appropriate, we plan to retain certain rights to participate in the development and commercialization of drug candidates arising from our programs and alliances, so that we can expand and capitalize on our own internal development capabilities and build our commercialization capabilities.

• | Conduct clinical development of novel, first-in-class and/or best-in-class muscle activators/inhibitors for the potential treatment of ALS, SMA, heart failure, HCM and other diseases impacting muscle function. Our portfolio consists of drug candidates that are in clinical development in principally four therapeutic areas, namely ALS, SMA, heart failure and HCM which may also inform their further development in other diseases characterized by either limited or excessive muscle function. We believe that by focusing on these disease areas that are associated with well-organized physician-investigator groups, significant unmet clinical needs, and strong patient and disease advocacy, we may enhance our effectiveness in enrolling and conducting clinical trials to answer important questions about the dosing, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the potential safety and efficacy of our drug candidates. We believe that our development programs can improve our ability to realize value from our and our partners’ clinical development activities. As we advance our drug candidates into later-stage clinical development, we extensively evaluate previous clinical trial designs and results to assess key learnings that may be applied to our late-stage clinical development activities. We believe this may result in more successful later-stage clinical development activities that may increase the likelihood of developing effective therapies that can address the needs of people living with these devastating diseases.

• | Collaborate with patient communities to support the urgent development of new medicines for diseases of impaired muscle function with pressing unmet medical needs. Central to our corporate strategy are the people living with a disease or medical condition characterized by impaired muscle function. We focus our development and commercialization activities on diseases that lack effective therapies and, in some cases, those with no approved medicines. We recognize that by applying our extensive knowledge of muscle biology towards the development of novel therapies for the people living with these diseases, we aim to improve lives of not only patients but also their caregivers and families. We collaborate with these individuals and their communities to ensure our potential drugs address their urgent needs and that we understand and appreciate the issues associated with these diseases and conditions. We work collaboratively with entities, such as patient advocacy groups, that focus on policies, guidelines and practices to accelerate development and commercialization of novel therapies, when possible and appropriate, and on ensuring that the voice of their constituencies are heard.

• | Mature our company’s operations to enable development, registration and commercialization of muscle biology drug candidates across North America and Europe. With a focus on disease areas for which there are serious unmet medical needs, we direct our activities to potential commercial opportunities in concentrated and tractable customer segments, such as hospital specialists and disease-specific centers of excellence, which may be addressed by smaller, targeted sales

forces. In preparing for the potential commercialization of our drug candidates directed to these markets, we are focusing our activities on the key issues facing patients and payors, including the principal drivers of clinical and economic burdens associated with these diseases. We also focus on opportunities that multiple stakeholders may recognize as creating value. Accordingly, targeting unmet medical needs in these areas may provide us competitive advantages and support our development of a potential franchise in diseases involving muscle function. In these markets, we believe that a company with limited resources may be able to compete effectively against larger, more established companies with greater financial and commercial resources. For these opportunities, we intend to develop clinical development and sales and marketing capabilities in North America and Europe with the goal of becoming a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company.

Research and Development Programs
 Our long-standing interest in the cytoskeleton has led us to focus our research and development activities on the biology of muscle function and, in particular, small molecule modulation of muscle contractility. We believe that our expertise in the modulation of muscle contractility is an important differentiator for us. Our preclinical and clinical experience in muscle contractility may position us to discover and develop additional novel therapies that have the potential to improve the health of patients with severe and debilitating diseases or medical conditions.
 Small molecules that affect muscle contractility may have several applications for a variety of serious diseases and medical conditions. For example, heart failure is a disease often characterized by impaired cardiac muscle contractility which may be treated by modulating the contractility of cardiac muscle. Similarly, certain diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness may be amenable to treatment by enhancing the contractility of skeletal muscle. Because the modulation of the contractility of different types of muscle, such as cardiac and skeletal muscle, may be relevant to multiple diseases or medical conditions, we believe we can leverage our expertise in these areas to more efficiently discover and develop potential drug candidates that modulate the applicable muscle type for multiple indications.
 We segment our research and development activities related to muscle contractility by our cardiac muscle contractility program and our skeletal muscle contractility program.  We also conduct research and development on novel treatments for disorders involving muscle function beyond muscle contractility.
 Our research and development expenses were $89.1 million for 2018, $90.3 million for 2017 and $59.9 million for 2016.
 Cardiac Muscle Program
 Our cardiac muscle contractility program is focused on the cardiac sarcomere, the basic unit of muscle contraction in the heart. The cardiac sarcomere is a highly ordered cytoskeletal structure composed of cardiac myosin, actin and a set of regulatory proteins. Cardiac myosin is the cytoskeletal motor protein in the cardiac muscle cell. It is directly responsible for converting chemical energy into the mechanical force, resulting in cardiac muscle contraction. Our most advanced cardiac program is based on the hypothesis that activators of cardiac myosin may address certain adverse properties of existing positive inotropic agents. Current positive inotropic agents, such as beta-adrenergic receptor agonists or inhibitors of phosphodiesterase activity, increase the concentration of intracellular calcium, thereby increasing cardiac sarcomere contractility. The effect on calcium levels, however, also has been linked to potentially life-threatening side effects. In contrast, our novel cardiac myosin activators work by a mechanism that directly stimulates the activity of the cardiac myosin motor protein, without increasing the intracellular calcium concentration. They accelerate the rate-limiting step of the myosin enzymatic cycle and shift it in favor of the force-producing state. Rather than increasing the velocity of cardiac contraction, this mechanism instead lengthens the systolic ejection time, which results in increased cardiac function in a potentially more oxygen-efficient manner.
 Our earlier stage cardiac program is based on the hypothesis that inhibitors of hyperdynamic contraction and obstruction of left ventricular blood flow may counteract the pathologic effects of mutations in the sarcomere that lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. A targeted oral therapy addressing this disease etiology may improve symptoms, exercise capacity and potentially slow disease progression. 
 Omecamtiv mecarbil
 Our lead drug candidate from our cardiac contractility program is omecamtiv mecarbil, a novel cardiac myosin activator. We expect omecamtiv mecarbil to be developed as a potential treatment across the continuum of care in heart failure both for use in the hospital setting and for use in the outpatient setting. Omecamtiv mecarbil is the subject of a Phase 3 development program in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction under our strategic alliance with Amgen.
 Amgen Strategic Alliance
 Our strategic alliance with Amgen to discover, develop, and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics designed to activate cardiac muscle, including omecamtiv mecarbil, for the potential treatment of heart failure is governed by the Amgen Agreement. Amgen has exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds

subject to our specified development and commercial participation rights. Amgen has also entered an alliance with Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier (“Servier”) for exclusive commercialization rights in Europe as well as the Commonwealth of Independent States (“CIS”), including Russia. Servier contributes funding for development and provides strategic support to the program.
 Under the Amgen Agreement we are eligible for potential additional pre-commercialization and commercialization milestone payments of over $600.0 million in the aggregate on omecamtiv mecarbil and other potential products arising from research under the collaboration, and royalties that escalate based on increasing levels of annual net sales of products commercialized under the agreement. 
 The Amgen Agreement provided for us to receive increased royalties by co-funding the Phase 3 development program for omecamtiv mecarbil and other drug candidates under the collaboration. We fully exercised this option and co-invested $40.0 million in the Phase 3 development program of omecamtiv mecarbil in exchange for a total incremental royalty from Amgen of up to 4% on increasing worldwide sales of omecamtiv mecarbil outside Japan and the right to co-promote omecamtiv mecarbil in institutional care settings in North America, with reimbursement by Amgen for certain sales force activities (the “Co-Invest Option”). A joint commercial operating team comprising representatives of Cytokinetics and Amgen will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the commercialization program of omecamtiv mecarbil. 
 Amgen generally has discretion to elect whether to pursue or abandon the development of omecamtiv mecarbil and may terminate our strategic alliance for any reason upon six months’ prior notice. With our consent, Amgen granted Servier an option to commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil in Europe and the CIS, including Russia, which Servier decided to exercise. In August 2016, we entered into a letter agreement with Amgen and Servier, which provides that if Amgen’s rights to omecamtiv mecarbil are terminated with respect to the territory subject to Servier’s sublicense, the sublicensed rights previously granted by Amgen to Servier with respect to omecamtiv mecarbil, will remain in effect and become a direct license or sublicense of such rights by us to Servier, on substantially the same terms as those in the Option, License and Collaboration Agreement between Amgen and Servier.
 Omecamtiv Mecarbil: Clinical Development
 GALACTIC-HF: GALACTIC-HF (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure) is a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil which is being conducted by Amgen, in collaboration with Cytokinetics. The primary objective of this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial is to determine if treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil when added to standard of care is superior to standard of care plus placebo in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure events in patients with high risk chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. GALACTIC-HF is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) with the FDA. GALACTIC-HF is planned to enroll approximately 8,000 symptomatic chronic heart failure patients in over 900 sites in 35 countries who are either currently hospitalized for a primary reason of heart failure or have had a hospitalization or admission to an emergency room for heart failure within one year prior to screening. Patients are randomized to either placebo or omecamtiv mecarbil with dose titration up to a maximum dose of 50 mg twice daily based on the plasma concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil after initiation of drug therapy. The primary endpoint is a composite of time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure event, whichever occurs first, with heart failure event defined as hospitalization, emergency room visit, or urgent unscheduled clinic visit for heart failure. Secondary endpoints include time to cardiovascular death; patient reported outcomes as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score; time to first heart failure hospitalization; and all-cause death.
 METEORIC-HF: In collaboration with Amgen, we are conducting METEORIC-HF (Multicenter Exercise Tolerance Evaluation of Omecamtiv Mecarbil Related to Increased Contractility in Heart Failure), a second Phase 3 clinical trial intended to evaluate its potential to increase exercise performance. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to omecamtiv mecarbil, which will be started at 25 mg twice daily and titrated to 25, 37.5 or 50 mg twice daily based on the same PK-guided dosing regimen as is used in GALACTIC-HF, or to placebo. METEORIC-HF is planned to enroll approximately 270 symptomatic chronic heart failure patients in nine countries. The primary endpoint of METEORIC-HF is change in peak oxygen uptake on Cardio-Pulmonary Exercise Testing (“CPET”) from baseline to Week 20. Secondary endpoints include change in total workload during CPET from baseline to Week 20, change in ventilatory efficiency during CPET from baseline to Week 20 and change in the average daily activity units measured over 2 weeks from baseline to Week 18-20. 
 AMG 594
 AMG 594 is a novel, selective, oral, small molecule cardiac troponin activator which was discovered under our joint research program with Amgen. In preclinical models, AMG 594 increases myocardial contractility by binding to cardiac troponin through an allosteric mechanism that sensitizes the cardiac sarcomere to calcium, facilitating more actin-myosin cross bridge formation during each cardiac cycle thereby resulting in increased myocardial contractility. Similar to cardiac myosin activation, preclinical research has shown that cardiac troponin activation does not change the calcium transient of cardiac myocytes. In collaboration with Cytokinetics, Amgen is conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single and multiple ascending dose, single-center Phase 1 study to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AMG 594 in healthy subjects. The study design includes several single ascending dose cohorts and three multiple ascending dose cohorts, with eight healthy subjects per cohort.

Omecamtiv Mecarbil: Heart Failure Commercial Market
 Heart failure is a widespread and debilitating syndrome affecting millions of people in the United States. The high and rapidly growing prevalence of heart failure translates into significant hospitalization rates and associated societal costs. About 6.4 million people in the United States have heart failure (approximately half with reduced ejection fraction), resulting in nearly one million hospital discharges with the primary diagnosis of heart failure and approximately 300,000 deaths each year. For people over 65 years of age, heart failure incidences approach 10 per 1000 and approximately 50% of people diagnosed with heart failure will die within 5 years of diagnosis. These numbers are increasing due to the aging of the U.S. population and an increased likelihood of survival following acute myocardial infarctions. 
 The costs to society attributable to heart failure are high, especially as many chronic heart failure patients suffer repeated acute episodes. Despite currently available therapies, readmission rates for heart failure patients remain high. In general, the mortality following hospitalization for patients with heart failure is approximately 10% at 30 days, 22% at one year and 42% at 5 years, despite the availability of therapeutic alternatives for treatment of these patients. These poor outcomes in the setting of current therapies point to the need for novel therapeutics that may offer further reductions in morbidity and mortality. The annual cost of heart failure to the U.S. health care system is estimated to be $32 billion and is predicted to grow to almost $70 billion by the year 2030. Approximately 70% of those costs are due to hospitalization, home health and physician care. In the U.S., Medicare is one of the largest payors for heart failure related costs. Approximately 50% of Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure are concentrated in the top 20% of the hospital referral regions in the U.S. New drug therapies that could reduce the number of hospitalizations could decrease the cost to the health care system.
 CK-274
 CK-274 is a novel, oral, small molecule cardiac myosin inhibitor that our company scientists discovered independent of our collaborations. CK-274 arose from an extensive chemical optimization program conducted with careful attention to therapeutic index and pharmacokinetic properties that may translate into best-in-class potential in clinical development. CK-274 was designed to reduce the hypercontractility that is associated with HCM. In preclinical models, CK-274 reduces myocardial contractility by binding directly to cardiac myosin at a distinct and selective allosteric binding site, thereby preventing myosin from entering a force producing state. CK-274 reduces the number of active actin-myosin cross bridges during each cardiac cycle and consequently reduces myocardial contractility. This mechanism of action may be therapeutically effective in conditions characterized by excessive hypercontractility, such as HCM.
 In preclinical models of cardiac function, CK-274 reduced cardiac contractility in a predictable dose and exposure dependent fashion. In preclinical models of disease, CK-274 reduced compensatory cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. The preclinical pharmacokinetics of CK-274 were characterized, evaluated and optimized for potential ease-of-use in the clinical setting. The initial focus of our development program for CK-274 will include an extensive characterization of its pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship as has been a hallmark of our development programs in muscle pharmacology. The overall development program will assess the potential of CK‑274 to improve exercise capacity and relieve symptoms in patients with hyperdynamic ventricular contraction due to HCM.
 CK-274: Clinical Development
 We are conducting a Phase 1 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-part, single and multiple ascending dose clinical trial of CK-274 to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CK-274 in healthy subjects. 
 CK-274: HCM Commercial Market
 HCM is the most common inherited cardiovascular disorder. HCM is a disease in which the heart muscle (myocardium) becomes abnormally thick (hypertrophied). The thickening of cardiac muscle leads to the inside of the left ventricle becoming smaller and stiffer, and thus the ventricle becomes less able to relax and fill with blood. This ultimately limits the heart’s pumping function, resulting in symptoms including chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or fainting during physical activity. A subset of patients with HCM are at high risk of progressive disease which can lead to atrial fibrillation, stroke and death due to arrhythmias. There are no current medical treatments that directly address the hypercontractility that underlies HCM.
Skeletal Muscle Contractility Program
 Our skeletal muscle contractility program is focused on the activation of the skeletal sarcomere, the basic unit of skeletal muscle contraction. The skeletal sarcomere is a highly ordered cytoskeletal structure composed of skeletal muscle myosin, actin, and a set of regulatory proteins, which include the troponins and tropomyosin. This program leverages our expertise developed in our ongoing discovery and development of cardiac sarcomere activators, including the cardiac myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil.
 We believe that our skeletal sarcomere activators may lead to new therapeutic options for diseases and medical conditions associated with neuromuscular dysfunction and potentially also conditions associated with aging and muscle weakness and wasting.  The clinical effects of muscle weakness and wasting, fatigue and loss of mobility can range from decreased quality of life to, in some instances, life-threatening complications. By directly improving skeletal muscle function, a small molecule activator of the skeletal sarcomere potentially could enhance functional performance and quality of life in patients suffering from diseases or medical

conditions associated with skeletal muscle weakness or wasting, such as ALS, SMA, COPD or sarcopenia (general frailty associated with aging).
 Reldesemtiv
 Reldesemtiv selectively activates the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex in the sarcomere by increasing its sensitivity to calcium, leading to an increase in skeletal muscle contractility. Reldesemtiv has demonstrated pharmacological activity in preclinical models and evidence of potentially clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effects in humans. The FDA has granted reldesemtiv orphan drug designation for the potential treatment of SMA. 
Astellas Strategic Alliance 
 Our strategic alliance with Astellas to advance novel therapies for diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle impairment and weakness is governed by the Astellas Agreement. We initially exclusively licensed to Astellas rights to co-develop and potentially co-commercialize reldesemtiv and other FSTAs in non-neuromuscular indications and to develop and commercialize other novel mechanism skeletal muscle activators in all indications, subject to certain Cytokinetics’ development and commercialization rights. Subsequently, we and Astellas expanded the strategic alliance to include certain neuromuscular indications, including SMA, for reldesemtiv and other FSTAs and to advance reldesemtiv into Phase 2 clinical development, initially in SMA. In 2016, we and Astellas further expanded the strategic alliance to include the development of reldesemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS, as well as the possible development in ALS of other FSTAs previously licensed by us to Astellas, and granted Astellas an option for a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of our first-generation FSTA, tirasemtiv (the “Option on Tirasemtiv”).
 The strategic alliance with Astellas includes a joint research program focused on the discovery of additional next-generation skeletal muscle activators, including sponsored research at Cytokinetics. This research program has been extended through 2019.
 We have options to conduct early-stage development for certain agreed indications at our initial expense, subject to reimbursement if development continues under the strategic alliance; to co-promote collaboration products containing FSTAs for neuromuscular indications in the U.S., Canada and Europe; and to co-promote other collaboration products in the U.S. and Canada. Astellas will reimburse us for certain expenses associated with our co-promotion activities. 
 Astellas is primarily responsible for the development of reldesemtiv in ALS, but we are conducting FORTITUDE-ALS and will share in the operational responsibility for subsequent clinical trials. Subject to specified guiding principles, decision making will be by consensus, subject to escalation and, if necessary, Astellas’ final decision-making authority on the development (including regulatory affairs), manufacturing, medical affairs and commercialization of reldesemtiv and other FSTAs in ALS. We and Astellas share equally the costs of developing reldesemtiv in ALS for potential registration and marketing authorization in the U.S. and Europe, provided that (i) Astellas has agreed to solely fund Phase 2 development costs of reldesemtiv in ALS subject to a right to recoup our share of such costs plus a 100% premium on such amounts by reducing future milestone and royalty payments to us and (ii) we may defer (but not eliminate) a portion of our co-funding obligation for development activities after Phase 2 for up to 18 months, subject to certain conditions. We have the right to co-fund our share of such Phase 2 development costs on a current basis, in which case there would not be a premium due to Astellas.
 Based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria, we may receive over $600.0 million in milestone payments relating to the development and commercial launch of collaboration products, including up to $112.0 million (of which we have received $17.0 million) relating to early development of reldesemtiv and for later-stage development and commercial launch milestones for reldesemtiv in non-neuromuscular indications, and over $100.0 million in development and commercial launch milestones for reldesemtiv in each of SMA and other neuromuscular indications. We may also receive up to $200.0 million in payments for achievement of pre-specified sales milestones related to net sales of all collaboration products. 
 If Astellas commercializes any collaboration products, we will also receive royalties on sales of such collaboration products, including royalties ranging from the high single digits to the high teens on sales of products containing reldesemtiv. We can co-fund certain development costs for reldesemtiv and other compounds in exchange for increased milestone payments and royalties; such royalties may increase under certain scenarios to exceed twenty percent. In addition to the foregoing development, commercial launch and sales milestones, we may also receive payments for the achievement of pre-specified milestones relating to the joint research program.
 Astellas generally has discretion to elect whether to pursue or abandon the development of reldesemtiv and other collaboration products, in whole or in part. Astellas may terminate our strategic alliance in whole or in part for any reason upon six months’ prior notice at any time following expiration of the strategic alliance’s research term, which will expire December 31, 2019.
 Reldesemtiv: Clinical Development 
 SMA: In June 2018, we announced data from a hypothesis-generating, Phase 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study in patients with SMA which was designed to determine potential pharmacodynamic effects of a suspension formulation of reldesemtiv following 8 weeks of oral dosing in each of two cohorts of 36 patients with Type II, Type III, or Type IV disease were

presented at the 2018 Annual Cure SMA Conference in Dallas. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of reldesemtiv. The study showed statistically significant concentration-dependent increases in changes from baseline in Six Minute Walk Distance (“6MWD”), a sub-maximal exercise test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The study also showed statistically significant increases for Maximal Expiratory Pressure (“MEP”), a measure of strength of respiratory muscles. Other assessments, including the Hammersmith Functional Motor Score - Extended, Revised Upper Limb Module, Timed Up-and-Go, Forced Vital Capacity, and the SMA Health Index (“SMA-HI”), a patient reported outcome measure (“PROM”) developed to comply with FDA standards for PROMs, did not demonstrate differences between reldesemtiv versus placebo. Adverse events were similar between groups receiving reldesemtiv and placebo. 
 Additional results presented at the 2018 Muscle Study Group Scientific Meeting in Oxford, U.K. showed sustained increases in 6MWD and MEP four weeks after discontinuation of study drug (i.e., follow-up). A post-hoc analysis also showed that changes from baseline in the 6MWD at 450 mg twice daily were significantly correlated with changes from baseline on certain domains of the SMA-HI intended to reflect improved endurance, especially Fatigue and Activity Participation. Decreases in SMA-HI scores reflect reduced disease burden as measured by that PROM, indicating that as 6MWD increases, disease burden assessed by that domain of the SMA-HI is reduced.
 In January 2019, we announced that we received feedback from the FDA that the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) is an acceptable primary efficacy endpoint for a potential registration program for reldesemtiv in patients with SMA who have maintained ambulatory function. The FDA also recommended adding a global function scale as a secondary endpoint. 
 ALS: In collaboration with Astellas, we are conducting FORTITUDE-ALS. This trial was designed to enroll approximately 450 eligible ALS patients to be randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive either 150 mg, 300 mg or 450 mg of reldesemtiv or placebo dosed orally twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of FORTITUDE-ALS is the change from baseline in the percent predicted slow vital capacity (“SVC”) at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints include slope of the change from baseline in the mega-score of muscle strength measured by hand held dynamometry (“HHD”) and handgrip dynamometry in patients on reldesemtiv; change from baseline in the ALS Functional Rating Scale – Revised (“ALSFRS-R”); incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”); and plasma concentrations of reldesemtiv at the sampled time points during the study. Exploratory endpoints will be measured including the effect of reldesemtiv versus placebo on self-assessments of respiratory function made at home by the patient with help as needed by the caregiver; disease progression through quantitative measurement of speech production characteristics over time; disease progression through quantitative measurement of handwriting abilities over time; and change from baseline in quality of life (as measured by the ALSAQ-5) in patients on reldesemtiv. In November 2018, we announced completion of enrollment in FORTITUDE-ALS. We expect results from this trial in the second quarter of 2019.
 COPD: Astellas, in collaboration with Cytokinetics, conducted a Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with COPD designed to assess the effect of reldesemtiv on physical function in patients with COPD. In October 2018, we announced that this trial did not meet the primary endpoint and did not demonstrate a statistically significant treatment difference in any of the secondary endpoints. Adverse events were similar between groups receiving reldesemtiv and placebo.
 Frailty: Astellas, in collaboration with Cytokinetics, conducted a Phase 1b clinical trial of reldesemtiv in elderly subjects with limited mobility. In October 2018, we announced that an interim analysis of this study had been conducted, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee for this trial determined that the pre-defined criteria for lack of efficacy of reldesemtiv had been met and Astellas had notified investigators to halt further enrollment in the trial.
 The clinical trials program for reldesemtiv may proceed for several years, and we may not generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed, regulatory approval is achieved, and the drug is commercialized. We cannot predict if or when this may occur. 
 Our expenditures will increase if Astellas terminates development of reldesemtiv or related compounds and we elect to develop them independently, or if we conduct early-stage development for certain agreed indications at our initial expense, subject to reimbursement if development continues under the collaboration. 
 CK-3762601
 In October 2018, we announced that we and Astellas are advancing CK-3762601 (“CK-601”), a next-generation FSTA, into IND-enabling studies, which triggered a $2 million milestone payment from Astellas to us. CK-601 was designed in a joint research program conducted by the companies’ scientists to have different pharmacokinetics and physicochemical properties than reldesemtiv which may inform its development for the treatment of diseases and conditions associated with both neuromuscular and non-neuromuscular etiology and pathogenesis.

Ongoing Research in Skeletal Muscle Activators 
 Our research program with Astellas has been extended through 2019. Our research on the direct activation of skeletal muscle continues in two areas. We are conducting translational research in preclinical models of disease and muscle function with FSTAs to explore the potential clinical applications of this novel mechanism in diseases or conditions associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction. We also intend to conduct preclinical research on other chemically and pharmacologically distinct mechanisms to activate the skeletal sarcomere. 
 Commercial Market for SMA: SMA is a severe neuromuscular disease that occurs in 1 in every 6,000 to 10,000 live births each year resulting in a prevalence of 10,000 to 15,000 patients in the U.S. and is one of the most common fatal genetic disorders. SMA manifests in various degrees of severity as progressive muscle weakness resulting in respiratory and mobility impairment. There are four types of SMA, distinguished by the time of the initial onset of muscle weakness and the severity of related symptoms: Type I (severe), Type II (intermediate), Type III (juvenile) and Type IV (adult onset). Life expectancy and disease severity varies by type of SMA from Type I, who have the worst prognosis and a life expectancy of approximately two years from birth, to Type IV, who have a normal life span but with gradual weakness in the proximal muscles of the extremities resulting in mobility issues. Type II, III and IV patients are often characterized by their ambulatory status as it is an important driver of clinical decisions and care and constitute 50% of the incident patient population but as much as 90% of the prevalent patient population. Few treatment options exist for these patients, resulting in a high unmet need for new therapeutic options to ameliorate symptoms, improve muscle function and modify disease progression. 
 Commercial Market for ALS: Limited options exist for the treatment of patients with ALS, which affects as many as 30,000 Americans, with an estimated 5,600 new cases diagnosed each year in the U.S. Based on our primary market research, the per capita prevalence and incidence appears similar in the major European markets. ALS is 20% more common in men than women; however, with increasing age, the prevalence becomes more equal between men and women. The life expectancy of an ALS patient averages two to five years from the time of diagnosis, mostly due to respiratory issues. Of the patients diagnosed with ALS, 5 to 10% have a family history of the disease (familial ALS) and remaining 90 to 95% have the sporadic form. The majority of patients with ALS in the U.S. and Europe receive treatment at a concentrated number of multidisciplinary centers that specialize in the unique needs of these patients. In the U.S., there are approximately 150 ALS multidisciplinary clinics, according to either the ALS Association or the Muscular Dystrophy Association. For most patients with ALS, death is usually due to respiratory failure because of diminished strength in the skeletal muscles responsible for breathing. We believe that there is an urgent need for novel therapies to address the unmet medical issues of this patient population which could be addressed by a small, targeted sales force. 
 Other Commercial Markets for Skeletal Muscle Activators: We continue to evaluate potential commercial markets for other potential indications for skeletal muscle activators.
 Tirasemtiv
 In November 2017, we announced that VITALITY-ALS, a Phase 3 clinical trial of tirasemtiv in patients with ALS, did not meet its primary endpoint of change from baseline in SVC and we suspended development of tirasemtiv. After consulting with an advisory board of ethicists, patient advocates, trial investigators and experts in pre-approval access to assess whether and how best to continue providing tirasemtiv to those people living with ALS participating in VIGOR-ALS, an open-label extension clinical trial designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of tirasemtiv in patients with ALS, we closed VIGOR-ALS and established a Managed Access Program for patients previously enrolled in VIGOR-ALS to remain on tirasemtiv.
Beyond Muscle Contractility
 We developed preclinical expertise in the mechanics of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle that extends from proteins to tissues to intact animal models. Our translational research in muscle contractility has enabled us to better understand the potential impact of small molecule compounds that increase skeletal or cardiac muscle contractility and to apply those findings to the further evaluation of our drug candidates in clinical populations. In addition to contractility, other major functions of muscle play a role in certain diseases that could benefit from novel mechanism treatments. Accordingly, our knowledge of muscle contractility may serve as an entry point to the discovery of novel treatments for disorders involving muscle functions other than muscle contractility. We are leveraging our current understandings of muscle biology to investigate new ways of modulating these other aspects of muscle function for other potential therapeutic applications.
Intellectual Property
 Our policy is to seek patent protection for the technologies, inventions and improvements that we develop that we consider important to the advancement of our business. As of December 31, 2018, we owned, co-owned or licensed 96 issued U.S. patents, over 360 issued patents in various foreign jurisdictions, and over 225 additional pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our commercial success will depend on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for our drug candidates and 
 
10
 

technologies and our successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents cover them or we maintain them as trade secrets.
 With regard to our drug candidates directed to muscle biology targets, we have a U.S. patent covering omecamtiv mecarbil and U.S. patents covering our skeletal muscle sarcomere activators including, but not limited to reldesemtiv, which expire in 2027 and 2031, respectively, unless extended or otherwise adjusted. We also have issued patents in various foreign jurisdictions and additional U.S. and foreign patent applications pending for these drug candidates. It is not known or determinable whether other patents will issue from any of our other pending applications or what the expiration dates would be for any other patents that do issue.
 Our drug candidates are still in clinical development and have not yet been approved by the FDA. If any of these drug candidates are approved, then pursuant to federal law, we may apply for an extension of the U.S. patent term for one patent covering the approved drug, which could extend the term of the applicable patent by up to a maximum of five additional years.
 The degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. Due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the claim scope of these patents, our ability to enforce our existing patents and to obtain and enforce patents that may issue from any pending or future patent applications is uncertain and involves complex legal, scientific and factual questions. The standards that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and are subject to change. To date, no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. Thus, we cannot be sure that any patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by, co-owned, or licensed to us. Even if patents do issue, we cannot be sure that the claims of these patents will be held valid or enforceable by a court of law, will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products, or will afford us a commercial advantage over competitive products. For example:
  
• | we or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications or issued patents;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for the inventions covered by our pending patent applications or issued patents;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | some or all of our or our licensors’ pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or the claims that issue may be narrow in scope and not provide us with competitive advantages;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our and our licensors’ issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable drugs or therapies or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our or our licensors’ patent applications or patents may be subject to interference, post-grant proceedings, opposition or similar legal and administrative proceedings that may result in a reduction in their scope or their loss altogether;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we may not develop additional proprietary technologies or drug candidates that are patentable; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the patents of others may prevent us or our partners from discovering, developing or commercializing our drug candidates.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The defense and prosecution of intellectual property infringement suits, interferences, post-grant proceedings, oppositions and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly, time-consuming to pursue and divert resources. The outcome of these types of proceedings is uncertain and could significantly harm our business.
 Our ability to commercialize drugs depends on our ability to use, manufacture and sell those drugs without infringing the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist that may be relevant to the therapeutic areas and chemical compositions of our drug candidates. While we are aware of certain relevant patents and patent applications owned by third parties, there may be issued patents or pending applications of which we are not aware that could cover our drug candidates. Because patent applications are often not published immediately after filing, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which could later result in issued patents that our activities with our drug candidates could infringe.
 The development of our drug candidates and the commercialization of any resulting drugs may be impacted by patents of companies engaged in competitive programs with significantly greater resources. This could result in the expenditure of significant legal fees and management resources.
 We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are often difficult to protect, especially outside of the United States. While we believe that we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, partners and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our trade secrets to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and is using our trade 
 
11
 

secrets would be expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Even if we are able to maintain our trade secrets as confidential, our competitors may independently develop information that is equivalent or similar to our trade secrets.
 We seek to protect our intellectual property by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of their employment or engagement, through which we seek to protect our intellectual property. Agreements with our employees also preclude them from bringing the proprietary information or materials of third parties to us. We also require confidentiality agreements or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential information or materials.
 For further details on the risks relating to our intellectual property, please see the risk factors under Item 1A of this report, including, but not limited to, the risk factors entitled “Our success depends substantially upon our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection relating to our drug candidates and research technologies” and “If we are sued for infringing third-party intellectual property rights, it will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome would have a significant adverse effect on our business.”
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our drug candidates and drugs.
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before our drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication in accordance with good clinical practices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of a new drug application (“NDA”) to the FDA, which must usually be accompanied by payment of a substantial user fee;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) regulations and FDA audits of select clinical investigator sites to assess compliance with good clinical practices (“GCP”); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Similar regulatory procedures generally apply in countries outside of the United States. This testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, and studies to evaluate toxicity and pharmacokinetics in animals. The results of non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND application to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects may be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Our submission of an IND or a foreign equivalent, or those of our collaborators, may not result in authorization from the FDA or its foreign equivalent to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) or its foreign equivalent for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB or their foreign equivalents, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Clinical Trials. For purposes of an NDA or equivalent submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following three sequential phases, which may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1: Phase 1 trials include the initial introduction of a drug candidate into humans. These studies may be conducted in patients, but are usually conducted in healthy volunteer subjects. These studies are designed to determine the metabolic and pharmacologic actions of the drug candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1, sufficient information about the drug candidate’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 trials. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
12
 

 
• | Phase 2: Phase 2 trials include the early controlled clinical studies conducted to obtain some preliminary data on the effectiveness of the drug candidate for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition. This phase of testing also helps determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug candidate. These clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to make an initial determination of potential efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2a clinical trials generally are designed to study the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties and to conduct a preliminary assessment of safety of the drug candidate over a measured dose response range. In some cases, a sponsor may decide to conduct a Phase 2b clinical trial, which is a second, typically larger, confirmatory Phase 2 trial that could, if positive and accepted by a regulatory authority, support approval of a drug candidate. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: If the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the drug candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are then undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 trials are also intended to provide an adequate basis for extrapolating the results to the general population and transmitting that information in the drug labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include several hundred to several thousand people, and are usually longer in duration than Phase 2 trials. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 At any time during the conduct of a clinical trial, the FDA or a foreign equivalent can impose a clinical hold on the trial if it believes the trial is unsafe or that the protocol is clearly deficient in design in meeting its stated objectives, which requires the conduct of the trial to cease until the clinical hold is removed. In some cases, the FDA or foreign equivalent may condition approval of marketing approval for a drug candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after marketing approval, known as Phase 4 clinical trials.
 The clinical trials we conduct for our drug candidates, both before and after approval, and the results of those trials, are generally required to be included in a clinical trials registry database that is available and accessible to the public via the internet. A failure by us to properly participate in the clinical trial database registry could subject us to significant civil monetary penalties.
 Health care providers in the United States, including research institutions from which we or our partners obtain patient information, are subject to privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and state and local privacy laws. In the European Union, these entities are subject to the Directive 95/46-EC of the European Parliament on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and individual European Union member states implementing additional legislation. The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area. Other countries have similar privacy legislation. We could face substantial penalties if we knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a health care provider that has not satisfied the applicable privacy laws. In addition, certain privacy laws and genetic testing laws may apply directly to our operations and/or those of our partners and may impose restrictions on the use and dissemination of individuals’ health information and use of biological samples.
 New Drug/Marketing Approval Application. The results of drug candidate development, preclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. The NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information. In addition, the FDA may require that a proposed Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, also known as a REMS, be submitted as part of the NDA if the FDA determines that it is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. Similar, and in some cases additional, requirements apply in foreign jurisdictions for marketing approval applications for drugs in those jurisdictions. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA often, but not always, follows the advisory committee’s recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA by issuing a complete response letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data, including data in a pediatric population, or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval for an NDA.
 Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our partners do. Once issued, the FDA or foreign equivalent may withdraw a drug approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the drug reaches the market. In addition, the FDA or its foreign counterparts may require further testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance or restrictive distribution programs to monitor the effect of approved drugs which have been commercialized. The FDA and its foreign counterparts have the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, if there are any modifications to a drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain prior FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, or the foreign equivalent, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 
13
 

Satisfaction of FDA regulations and requirements or similar regulations and requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years. The actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidate or disease. Typically, if a drug candidate is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with some of our drug candidates, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of drug candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. The FDA or any other regulatory agency may not grant approvals for new indications for our drug candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Even if a drug candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages or restrictive distribution programs. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug may result in restrictions on the drug or even complete withdrawal of the drug from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain, regulatory approvals for any of our drug candidates would harm our business. In addition, we cannot predict what future U.S. or foreign governmental regulations may be implemented.
 Orphan Drug Designation. Some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. The FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. 
 An FDA orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a drug candidate that has an orphan drug designation receives the first FDA marketing approval for the indication for which the designation was granted, then the approved drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. This means that the FDA may not approve another company’s application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in certain circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the drug with orphan exclusivity or if the holder of the orphan drug designation cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the designation was granted. Competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan drug has exclusivity.
 Special Protocol Assessment.  A sponsor may request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreement with FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement if public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the SPA agreement, or a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy is identified after testing has begun. An SPA does not guarantee that an NDA will be approved.
 Fast Track Designation. Fast track is a process designed by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. Although fast track designation does not affect the standards for approval, the benefits of this designation include scheduled meetings to seek FDA input into development plans, the option of submitting an NDA in sections rather than all components simultaneously, and the potential eligibility for priority review if supported by clinical data.
 Other Regulatory Requirements. Any drugs manufactured or distributed by us or our partners pursuant to FDA approvals or their foreign counterparts are subject to continuing regulation by the applicable regulatory authority, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by these regulatory authorities for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA and other regulatory requirements. If our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA or its foreign counterparts may halt our or our partners’ clinical trials, require us to recall a drug from distribution, or withdraw approval of the NDA for that drug.
 For further details on the risks relating to government regulation of our business, please see the risk factors under Item 1A of this report, including, but not limited to, the risk factor entitled “The regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent our partners or us from obtaining approvals to commercialize some or all of our drug candidates.”
 Competition
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address neuromuscular and cardiovascular diseases and other diseases relating to muscle dysfunction, each of which is highly competitive. We face significant competition from most pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that are also researching and selling products designed to address cardiovascular diseases and diseases and medical conditions associated with skeletal muscle weakness and wasting. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive experience in clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. These companies also have significantly greater research capabilities than we do. In addition, many universities 
 
14
 

and private and public research institutes are active in research of neuromuscular and cardiovascular diseases and other diseases where there is muscle dysfunction, some in direct competition with us.
 We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:
  
• | our drug candidates’ efficacy, safety and tolerability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | the speed and cost-effectiveness with which we develop our drug candidates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the selection of suitable indications for which to develop our drug candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the successful completion of clinical development and laboratory testing of our drug candidates;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the timing and scope of any regulatory approvals we or our partners obtain for our drug candidates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our or our partners’ ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of our approved drugs to meet market demand;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | acceptance of our drugs by physicians and other health care providers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the willingness of third-party payors to provide reimbursement for the use of our drugs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing the intellectual property of others;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the quality and breadth of our technology;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | our employees’ skills and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our cash flows under existing and potential future arrangements with licensees, partners and other parties; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our competitors may develop drug candidates and market drugs that are less expensive and more effective than our future drugs or that may render our drugs obsolete. Our current or future competitors may also commercialize competing drugs before we or our partners can launch any drugs developed from our drug candidates. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and potential parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic alliances.
 If omecamtiv mecarbil is approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, it would compete against other drugs used for the treatment of chronic heart failure. These include generic drugs, such as milrinone, dobutamine or digoxin and branded drugs such as Corlanor (ivabradine), and Entresto®. Omecamtiv mecarbil could also potentially compete against other novel drug candidates and therapies in development, such as those being developed by ARCA biopharma, Inc., Novartis, Bayer, Merck, Theravance Biopharma, Capricor, Cardiorentis AG, Ono Pharmaceutical Company, ARMGO Pharma, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Zensun Sci & Tech, Ltd., and Tenax Therapeutics (formerly known as Oxygen Biotherapeutics, Inc.).

 If reldesemtiv is approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for the treatment of ALS, it may then compete with other drugs used for the treatment of ALS including Radicava (edaravone) and potential new therapies for ALS that are currently being developed by companies such as Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
