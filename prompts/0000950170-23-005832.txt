Overview

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, transformative medicines for neurological diseases. We were formed in January 2020 by Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Arena) to advance a portfolio of centrally acting product candidates designed to be highly selective for specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Our small molecule product candidates were discovered out of the same platform at Arena that represents a culmination of more than 20 years of world-class GPCR research. Arena was purchased by Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) on March 11, 2022 and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
 
We are currently focused on developing the following product candidates in our pipeline:
•LP352, an oral, centrally acting, 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptor subtype (5-HT2C) superagonist, currently in a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial (the PACIFIC Study) expected to evaluate 50 participants ages 12 to 65 years old with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), which may include Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), SCN2A-related disorders, among others, with study enrollment expected to be completed in the first half of 2023 and topline data expected in the second half of 2023; and
 •LP659, a centrally acting, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor subtypes 1 and 5 (S1P1,5) modulator, for which we anticipate initiating a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2023 and anticipate topline single ascending dose (SAD) data in the second half of 2023.
 
LP352, our most advanced product candidate, is a potential best-in-class serotonin receptor agonist anti-seizure medication (ASM) for DEEs. LP352 has shown no measurable impact on 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptor subtypes in preclinical studies to date. 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptor agonism have been associated with significant adverse side effects, including valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension in the case of the 5-HT2B receptor, and euphoria, hallucination, and dissociation in the case of the 5-HT2A receptor. LP352 has the potential to be a clinically differentiated 5-HT2C superagonist for patients with DEEs, a group of severe early-childhood onset epilepsies characterized by refractory seizures and developmental delay and/or regression. Certain compounds in the 5-HT2C agonist class, including FINTEPLA and lorcaserin, have been shown to produce clinical benefit in epilepsy patients, although the side effect profiles of available non-selective 5-HT2 therapies may limit their use due to their activity on receptor subtypes 5-HT2B and/or 5-HT2A. We believe LP352’s potential for high selectivity and novel chemistry may reduce seizures and lead to differentiated non-seizure outcomes in DEE patients, as well as overcome the known or perceived safety limitations of available drugs in the 5-HT2 class.

We are also developing LP659, a centrally acting, S1P1,5 receptor modulator for which aberrant modulation has been shown to be involved in a wide range of neurological diseases. Based on its novel chemistry, potential for high selectivity for specific subtypes of GPCRs and favorable blood-brain-barrier penetration, we believe LP659 has the potential to address multiple inflammatory neurological conditions. LP659 was designed by Arena to have more optimized pharmacology and pharmacokinetics (PK) for its intended S1P receptor subtypes, compared to other known compounds. We believe this potential selectivity and specificity could result in a superior profile in the clinic compared to drugs that may not fully engage the intended GPCR target, may cause off-target activity, or may be associated with other undesirable effects.

Our Pipeline

Our product candidates are targeted towards specific GPCRs. GPCRs mediate cell-to-cell communication in humans, and approximately 40% of prescription drugs currently on the market target mainly GPCRs, making GPCRs a highly validated class of drug targets. Our GPCR product candidates are designed to increase the likelihood of the desired pharmacology and PK and minimize the risk of off-target effects.


The following table provides an overview of our product candidates currently in development:
   
LP352

We are developing LP352, an oral, centrally acting, 5-HT2C superagonist for DEEs and other epileptic disorders. LP352 is the only 5-HT2C receptor agonist being dose optimized specifically for DEEs, a group of severe early-childhood onset epilepsies characterized by refractory seizures and developmental delay and/or regression. These diseases are often progressive and resistant to treatment. DEEs encompass a diverse range of over 25 syndromes, of which only four currently have FDA-approved therapies. We believe that LP352 could be a treatment for individuals with DEEs where no options are available and a potentially safer, more efficacious, easy to add-on treatment option for individuals with syndromes where current therapies are inadequate.
 
The following diagram illustrates the current DEE landscape:
 

LP352 selectively targets the 5-HT2C receptor, which has been shown to upregulate the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a principal neurotransmitter in the brain. This release of GABA increases the threshold for neuronal hyperexcitability, and decreases the likelihood of seizure occurrences. We believe LP352 has the mechanistic potential to reduce seizures in a broad number of DEEs.

We initiated our first clinical trial in patients with DEEs (the PACIFIC Study) in the first quarter of 2022. We plan to evaluate 50 patients, ages 12 to 65 years old, with a range of DEEs, across sites in the United States and Australia. Topline data is expected in the second half of 2023. In addition, we have conducted multiple Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers with LP352, and will continue to conduct such trials to further explore the potential of LP352.

LP659

We are developing LP659, a centrally acting, S1P1,5 receptor modulator for inflammatory neurological conditions. LP659 was designed for optimized pharmacology, PK and engagement of S1P1,5, which may lead to improved efficacy and safety. LP659 was designed to avoid the negative effects connected to the receptor subtypes 2 and 3, which may be associated with more serious, off-target cardiac, pulmonary, and cancer-related effects. Aberrant S1P receptor modulation has been shown to be involved in a wide range of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, lupus, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Preclinical data demonstrated an initial dose-dependent decrease in disease progression over 17 days in a mouse model of demyelinating disease. LP659 rapidly reduced circulating lymphocytes, which returned to baseline after its clearance. We believe LP659 has high oral bioavailability with a direct impact on CNS glial cell S1P receptors. We anticipate initiating a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers for LP659 in the first half of 2023. Topline SAD data is expected in the second half of 2023.
 
Our Company History and Team

We were established in January 2020 as Arena Neuroscience, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Arena, based in San Diego, California. We changed our name to Longboard Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and launched as an independent company in October 2020. Building on Arena’s 20-year history in discovering, developing and optimizing GPCR therapies, we believe we are well positioned to execute our clinical development programs. Our current product candidates LP352 and LP659 were designed by Arena to have distinct chemistry and therapeutic profiles from Arena’s other product candidates with similar mechanisms of actions. Namely, LP352 was designed to be centrally acting and a more specific and selective 5-HT2C subtype receptor agonist than lorcaserin, and LP659 was designed to be a centrally acting S1P1,5 receptor modulator with differentiated selectivity and blood brain penetration compared to etrasimod (an S1P1 receptor modulator that is Arena's lead product candidate and the subject of an New Drug Application (NDA) submission accepted for review in December of 2022 following Arena's acquisition by Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer)).
 
In October 2020, we entered into a License Agreement (Arena License Agreement) with Arena, pursuant to which Arena granted us an exclusive, royalty bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license to develop and commercialize LP352, LP659, LP143 and certain 5-HT2A compounds (pharmaceutical products containing any such product candidates, the Licensed Products). In January 2022, we amended the Arena License Agreement to add an additional program, and in September 2022 we further amended the Arena License Agreement to expand the field of the license of LP659 and provide Arena a right of first negotiation to acquire certain development and commercial rights to LP659 products.
 
Our Strategy

Our goal is to develop therapies targeting well-characterized receptor pathways with optimized pharmacology and PK properties to transform the lives of patients with neurological diseases, initially focused on rare neurological diseases. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include:

•Advance our lead program LP352 through clinical development and approval in DEEs. There are only treatment options for four out of the over 25 DEEs, currently. Additionally, existing treatment options for these rare neurological diseases have significant limitations, and, if approved, we believe LP352 would represent a potential therapeutic advancement for patients. 
 
•Continue preclinical development of LP659, an S1P1,5 receptor modulator, across a range of neurological diseases and progress into clinical development. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2023 and anticipate topline SAD data in the second half of 2023. 
 
•Identify additional product candidates, including those that we currently hold rights to, and expand current candidates into additional neurological diseases. We see potential for our current product candidates to be evaluated in clinical trials outside of their initial indications and will evaluate additional indications to maximize the potential of our pipeline. We also plan to continue to identify and develop additional novel product candidates that align with our strategy.
 
•Explore strategic collaborations to maximize the value of our product candidates. We plan to explore collaborations opportunistically to maximize the value of our pipeline. We intend to retain significant economic and commercial rights to our programs in key geographic areas that are core to our long-term strategy. 
 


Our Product Candidates

LP352, an oral, centrally acting, 5-HT2C superagonist

We are developing LP352, an oral, centrally acting, 5-HT2C superagonist for DEEs and other epileptic disorders. LP352 is designed to selectively target 5-HT2C, which has been shown to upregulate the release of GABA, a principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. The release of GABA increases the threshold for neuronal hyperexcitability and decreases the likelihood of seizure occurrence. We believe LP352 has the mechanistic potential to reduce the frequency of seizures in Dravet syndrome and LGS as well as a broader epilepsy population. We have conducted multiple clinical trials in healthy volunteers with LP352. We initiated the PACIFIC Study in patients with DEEs in the first quarter of 2022 and expect to have topline data in the second half of 2023.
Background on Epilepsy

Epilepsy covers a broad range of disorders and is characterized by spontaneous and recurrent seizures, or bursts of neuronal hyperactivity. Seizures are caused by a disrupted balance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling at the synaptic level. Excitatory synaptic activity is normally regulated by inhibitory interneurons, but disruptions to this regulatory process can result in hyperexcitability. Common aberrations include mutations to ion channels or neurotransmitter genes or proteins that regulate signaling, such as GABA, and disruptions lead to the signaling aberrations characteristic of epileptic disorders. For example, Dravet syndrome is characterized by mutations in the sodium ion channel, the ion channel critical for the generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons, and which ordinarily plays a crucial role in inhibitory signaling.

Overview of the Forms of Epilepsy

Epilepsy spans all age groups and in many cases is debilitating, with a large portion of patients resistant to pharmacologic treatment, underscoring a large unmet need. Epilepsy is currently estimated to affect up to 1.2% percent of the U.S. population or approximately 3.4 million individuals, with roughly 150,000 new cases diagnosed each year. We are initially focused on DEEs, which are a group of severe early childhood-onset epilepsies characterized by refractory seizures and developmental delay and/or regression and include Dravet syndrome and LGS, among others, but the 5-HT2C pathway has been implicated in a broader set of epilepsies.

Dravet Syndrome - Dravet syndrome is an early childhood-onset CNS disease that results in severe epileptic seizures typically occurring within the first year after birth. Incidence for Dravet syndrome is approximately 1:15,000 in the United States, and 90% of the associated mutations are de novo (not passed from a parent). Mortality rate for Dravet syndrome patients is higher than general epilepsy patients, with a rate of 15-20% by adulthood. The disease is genetically linked, with 70% to 85% of cases characterized by mutations in the SCN1A gene. Mutations cause defects in the function of the sodium ion channel. Seizures due to Dravet syndrome are typically difficult to control and require life-long treatment.

Lennox Gastaut Syndrome - LGS is a severe form of childhood-onset epilepsy with prevalence of approximately 1:7,000 in the United States. The age of onset is typically between three and five years and affected children typically experience cognitive dysfunction, leading to developmental and behavioral problems. LGS is characterized by multiple seizure types, with the most common associated seizures being tonic and atonic seizures. Seizures due to LGS are difficult to control and generally require life-long treatment. The pathophysiology of LGS is less known than Dravet syndrome.

Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) - TSC is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to form in many different organs, primarily in the brain, eyes, heart, kidney, skin and lungs. The aspects of TSC that most strongly impact quality of life are generally associated with the brain: seizures, developmental delay, intellectual disability and autism. Current estimates place TSC-affected births at 1:6,000 in the United States. Nearly 1 million people worldwide are estimated to have TSC, with approximately 50,000 in the United States.

CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD) – CDD is a rare developmental epileptic encephalopathy caused by mutations in the CDKL5 gene, and this can manifest in a broad range of clinical symptoms and severity. The hallmarks are early-onset, intractable epilepsy and neurodevelopmental delay impacting cognitive, motor, speech, and visual function. Although rare, the occurrence is believed to be approximately 1:40,000 -60,000 live births in the United States, making it one of the most common forms of genetic epilepsy.
 
Current Treatment Paradigm

DEEs are commonly treated with multiple combinations of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) though physician preference for administered therapies differs across different epilepsy types. Currently available AEDs have limited long-term efficacy with many patients cycling through multiple lines of treatment to try to optimize efficacy. Non-pharmaceutical therapies for epilepsy patients include a ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and surgery for some patients.


The following table is illustrative of the typical treatment paradigm for DEEs:

Dravet syndrome and LGS are two types of epilepsies that are difficult to treat given that most patients are refractory to antiseizure medications. The seizures for a vast majority of these patients remain uncontrolled and patients typically require multiple lines of treatment. FDA approved drugs in Dravet syndrome include Epidiolex® (cannabidol), FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) and DIACOMIT® (stiripentol). Epidiolex is also approved in LGS and TSC. Ztalmy is approved for CDD. Despite these treatments being available, we believe a significant unmet medical need remains.

Background on GABA and Neurotransmission

GABA is a principal neurotransmitter in the brain and binds to receptors inside and outside the synaptic gap. GABA plays key roles in neuronal inhibition, and reduction of GABA levels has been shown to result in a decline of this inhibition. Lack of GABA-mediated inhibition subsequently leads to the chronic activation of post-synaptic neurons characteristic of seizures.

5-HT2 Receptors

5-HT receptors, or serotonin receptors, are widely expressed in neural networks. Serotonin plays a key role in modulating neurotransmission, as agents elevating extracellular serotonin levels have been shown to inhibit focal and generalized seizures while agents reducing serotonin levels have been shown to lower the threshold for seizures. To date, 14 receptor subtypes of 5-HT receptors have been characterized and are grouped into seven classes. The two main classes are 5-HT1 and 5-HT2. 5-HT2 receptors are G-coupled membrane proteins that are distinguished by their function of increasing intracellular calcium levels (Ca2+) and activation of protein kinase C. Three subtypes exist: 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C, with the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor subtypes primarily expressed in the CNS and 5-HT2B primarily expressed in the peripheral nervous system. All subtypes have been shown to modulate neurotransmission, though the 5-HT2B receptor has been implicated with valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension and the 5-HT2A receptor subtype has been implicated with hallucinations and mild to severe anxiety.

5-HT2C is one of the many binding sites for serotonin and is expressed on GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic neurons. Multiple preclinical studies have suggested that 5-HT2C plays an important role in the inhibition of seizures. For example, in a knockout mouse model, mice missing the 5-HT2C receptor subtype were shown to have a lower threshold for seizures and experienced spontaneous convulsions. Preclinical models suggest that activation of 5-HT2C regulates GABA and glutamate pathophysiology seen in seizure disorders. Excitatory glutamate release is directly and indirectly regulated by 5-HT actions on GABA interneurons and pyramidal neurons. Research proposes that neuronal hyperexcitability occurs during the transition to seizure when excitatory glutamatergic activity increases while inhibitory GABAergic synaptic input is weakened. It is thought that 5-HT2C agonists, acting on GABA interneurons, inhibit excitatory glutamatergic activity, thereby decreasing neuronal action potential firing and downstream electrical activity.



This downstream electrical activity is illustrated in the below:



The 5-HT2 class and 5-HT2C subtype have additionally been shown in the clinic to reduce seizure frequencies.

FINTEPLA (fenfluramine) - FINTEPLA, a 5-HT2 receptor agonist with activity on 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors, was initially developed as monotherapy treatment for adult obesity as well as in combination with phentermine (fen-phen). Later, however, reports were published documenting cases of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension, causing the drug to be pulled from the market in 1997. More recently, Zogenix, Inc. (Zogenix) began developing fenfluramine for Dravet syndrome, LGS, and other rare epilepsies using lower doses of fenfluramine. In June 2020, the FDA approved fenfluramine for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Approval was based on data from two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as safety data from an open-label extension trial in which patients received FINTEPLA for up to three years. Patients administered the therapy demonstrated significant reductions in monthly convulsive seizure frequency compared to placebo. However, the FDA placed a boxed warning in FINTEPLA’s label noting an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B agonist activity, including fenfluramine, and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS program, in which prescribers and patients must be enrolled. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required pretreatment, during treatment and after treatment with FINTEPLA. In June 2022, the FDA approved fenfluramine for the treatment of seizures associated with LGS. Zogenix was acquired by UCB in June 2022 for approximately $1.9 billion.
 
Lorcaserin - Lorcaserin, a 5-HT2C agonist, was discovered by Arena, approved by the FDA for weight management, and marketed as BELVIQ by Eisai Inc. Lorcaserin was withdrawn from the market at the request of the FDA following the FDA’s analysis of the CAMELLIA-TIMI 61 clinical trial, for which patients in the lorcaserin group demonstrated a numerically higher but not a statistically significantly higher rate of total cancer diagnoses (7.7% vs 7.1% placebo). Based on the results of this clinical trial, the FDA concluded that the risks of lorcaserin outweigh the benefits, and requested that lorcaserin be withdrawn from the market for the approved indication of weight management in February 2020. The FDA authorized an expanded access program for patients with Dravet syndrome to continue to receive lorcaserin.

Lorcaserin has demonstrated the potential to reduce seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome and refractory epilepsies. A National Institutes of Health funded study conducted at the University of California, San Francisco showed that several 5-HT receptor modulating compounds, including lorcaserin, reduced seizure-like activity in a zebrafish model of Dravet syndrome.

Lorcaserin has been tested in a small study of “off-label” use in five children who each had an SCN1A (sodium channel) gene mutation or a clinical diagnosis of Dravet syndrome, and failed at least two medications. Lorcaserin was initially dosed at 2.5 mg at bedtime and gradually increased weekly as needed to a maximum dose of 10 mg twice a day or 0.3 mg/kg/day, whichever occurred

first. One patient was initially seizure-free for three weeks, one patient was seizure-free for two weeks, and a third patient had one to two seizure-free days per week. All five patients exhibited a reduction in the total number of seizures after three months on treatment.

A follow-up retrospective study conducted in 35 lorcaserin-treated refractory epilepsy patients found a 50% reduction in mean monthly frequency of seizures in LGS patients (n = 9), a 43% reduction in patients with Dravet syndrome (n = 20), and a 23% reduction in patients with other epilepsies (n = 6). Overall, the study demonstrated a 47.7% median percentage reduction in mean monthly frequency of motor seizures from baseline.

In September 2020, following consultation with the FDA, Eisai Inc. initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial of lorcaserin in patients with Dravet syndrome.

Our Solution

LP352 in Epilepsies

LP352 is an oral, centrally acting, 5-HT2C superagonist. A superagonist displays higher receptor signaling output than the natural agonist. As a 5-HT2C superagonist, LP352 is designed to modulate GABA inhibition and as a result, suppress the hyperexcitability that is characteristic of seizures. Based on its potential mechanism of action, we believe that LP352 has the potential to reduce the frequency of seizures in Dravet syndrome, LGS, and across a broad range of refractory epilepsies. 5-HT2C agonism has shown clinical benefit in epilepsy patients, however, currently available 5-HT2 agonists have been associated with significant adverse events (AEs). LP352 was discovered at Arena, and was developed to be the next-generation to lorcaserin. LP352 has novel chemistry and attributes, and was designed with the goal of being a safer, more effective 5-HT2C superagonist. We hold worldwide rights to LP352 through the Arena License Agreement.

LP352 has demonstrated selectivity on the 5-HT2C receptor subtype with no detected activity on the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptor subtypes in in vitro preclinical studies, as shown in the following table:
 
The above table is for illustrative purposes only and is not a head-to-head comparison. These data were generated from different studies, and caution should be exercised when comparing data across studies. However, each of these studies followed the same basic protocol using HEK293 cells expressing recombinant human 5-HT2 receptors, and receptor densities in all of the functional assays were determined by [125I]-2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, or DOI, radioligand binding.

A superagonist is a compound that is capable of producing a higher receptor response than the endogenous agonist. We have shown LP352 to be a superagonist in a dynamic mass redistribution assay measuring a holistic integrated cellular response to

lorcaserin, serotonin and LP352. This assay demonstrated that, as the concentration of LP352 increases, the cellular response is greater than the endogenous ligand serotonin and considerably more than lorcaserin. The results of this assay are demonstrated below.
 

LP352 Clinical Development Overview

Phase 1 Clinical Trial SAD-MAD
 
LP352 was evaluated in a multi-part Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that included a SAD portion (with and without food effect) and a MAD portion (with and without dose titration). Safety and tolerability were evaluated throughout the clinical trial, and blood sampling and urine samples for PK analysis were also collected. LP352 was administered as a capsule formulation. The Phase 1 clinical trial enrolled 83 healthy participants. Doses ranging from 1 mg to 24 mg were evaluated.
 
SAD Results - LP352 was observed to be generally well-tolerated, and AEs were consistent with events observed with other centrally acting 5-HT2C agonists. Headache was the dose limiting AE, and mild to moderate headache was the most common treatment-emergent AE. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) reported, and no participants dropped out due to AEs. In the SAD and food effect portions of the clinical trial, LP352 demonstrated favorable PK and pharmacodynamic effects (with target plasma exposure (minimum serum concentration) measured based on prolactin levels), including dose-dependent PK properties with proportional increases in AUC and Cmax.

MAD Results - Five doses including the maximum planned dose were evaluated. The majority of AEs were mild to moderate, with the most common being headache. AEs were generally consistent with CNS effects and expected effects of serotonergic drugs. A single SAE of anxiety was reported at the maximum planned dose two days after the last dose of study drug and subsequently resolved. LP352 demonstrated dose- and exposure-dependent increases of prolactin, suggesting proof of central 5-HT2C receptor engagement, as well as dose-dependent increases in exposure (Cmax and AUCtau). The safety and tolerability of titrating LP352 was also examined.

Other Phase 1 Clinical Trials
 
In December 2022, we announced topline data from cohorts 1 and 2 of a Phase 1 clinical trial assessing CNS PK/PD parameters in healthy adult male and female participants. In these cohorts LP352 exhibited a strong correlation between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PK concentration, which increased in a dose-dependent and consistent manner. In these cohorts LP352 also demonstrated early quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) changes and sustained effects on qEEG activity after continuous dosing in a dose-dependent manner indicating receptor engagement, and favorable safety and tolerability results were observed, with AEs generally consistent with previous clinical studies.
 

We are currently conducting and plan to conduct additional Phase 1 clinical trials with LP352 to further characterize and differentiate LP352.
 
The PACIFIC Study - a Phase 1b/2a Clinical Trial of LP352 in Patients with DEEs
 
The PACIFIC Study is a Phase 1b/2a safety, tolerability and exploratory efficacy clinical trial of LP352. This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. We plan to enroll 50 participants ages 12-65 with a variety of treatment resistant motor seizures and seizure disorders that fall into the category of DEEs. The PACIFIC Study was initiated in the first quarter of 2022, with completion of enrollment expected in the first half of 2023 and topline data expected in the second half of 2023.


LP659, a centrally acting, S1P1,5 modulator

We are developing LP659, a centrally acting, S1P1,5 receptor modulator for inflammatory neurological conditions. LP659 was designed to have optimized pharmacology, PK and engagement of S1P1,5, which may lead to improved efficacy and safety. LP659 was designed to avoid the negative effects connected to the receptor subtypes 2 and 3, which may be associated with more serious, off-target cardiac, pulmonary, and cancer-related effects. Aberrant S1P receptor modulation has been shown to be involved in a wide range of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Lupus, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Preclinical data in a mouse model of demyelinating disease demonstrated that LP659 treatment produced a dose-dependent decrease in disease progression over 17 days. LP659 rapidly reduced circulating lymphocytes, which returned to baseline after its clearance. In a PK/PD study to assess LP659 effects on lymphocytes in rats, male rats were given a 0.00 (vehicle control), 0.300 or 1.00 mg/kg oral dose of LP659 (n=3 per dosing group). Fingolimod, the positive control for blood lymphopenia, was given as an oral dose (n=4) at 1.00 mg/kg to a separate group of rats. Blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48 and 72 hours post-dose for blood lymphocyte and

plasma drug concentration measurements. LP659 at both doses demonstrated a rapid reduction in lymphocytes which returned to baseline, whereas no return to baseline was observed for fingolimod over the study duration.
 

A study of CNS distribution of LP659 was conducted in rats. Male rats were dosed orally with LP659 at 1.00 mg/kg for six consecutive days. On Day 6, plasma, brain and cerebrospinal fluid samples were taken at 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 24 hours post-last dose (n = 3 per time point). The maximum plasma concentration of LP659 was 551 ng/mL at 3.00 hours post-dose. The maximum brain concentration of LP659 was 947 ng/mL at 8.00 hours post-dose. The mean brain to plasma ratios of LP659 at 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 24 hours post-last dose were 2.87, 1.25, 1.17, 1.68, 1.98, and 2.94, respectively. We believe LP659 has high oral bioavailability with a direct impact on CNS glial cell S1P receptors. We anticipate initiating a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2023 and expect topline SAD data in the second half of 2023.

S1P Receptors

S1P receptors are expressed broadly in the CNS. By limiting lymphocyte circulation, S1P receptor modulators exert anti-inflammatory effects. Multiple S1P receptor modulators have been approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. There are five known receptor types: S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, S1P4 and S1P5. S1P1, S1P2 and S1P3 receptors are expressed broadly, S1P4 is primarily expressed in immune system cells, and S1P5 is expressed primarily in the spleen and CNS. Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the human CNS and preferentially express S1P3 and S1P1 and express S1P2 at low levels. Oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC), neurons, and microglia are other brain cells that express S1P.


The various brain cell types are illustrated in the below:



Our Solution

LP659 in Neurological Diseases

LP659 acts as a S1P1 and S1P5 receptor subtypes modulator with no observed impact on S1P2 or S1P3 and has been selectively developed to cross the blood-brain barrier and target neurological diseases. In addition to its receptor subtype selectivity, LP659 has demonstrated rapid onset and offset of action (in preclinical models), with a low half-maximal inhibitory concentration in plasma (IC50 approximately 25 ng/ml in rat) to inhibit entrance of lymphocytes into blood. A single dose of LP659 causes rapid depletion of circulating lymphocytes and rapid recovery, paralleling elimination of LP659 from plasma. The S1P receptor has been well-validated in slowing the progression of neurodegeneration, notably in multiple sclerosis, for which disease area the FDA has approved four S1P receptor modulators. LP659 was designed to avoid the negative effects connected to the receptor subtypes 2 and 3, which may be associated with more serious, off-target cardiac, pulmonary, and cancer-related effects. While initial studies have shown that LP659 is efficacious in reducing the development and severity of disease in a widely accepted model of demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis), we have not finalized a target indication as we see potential for a selective S1P1 receptor modulator to treat a spectrum of inflammatory neurological conditions.
Other Compounds

We have a license to certain compounds including LP143, a centrally acting, full cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2) agonist, and compounds targeting the 5-HT2A receptor, including nelotanserin. We are not currently developing any of these compounds.
License Agreement with Arena

The Arena License Agreement was originally entered into in October 2020 and amended in January 2022 and again in September 2022. Pursuant to the Arena License Agreement, Arena granted us an exclusive, royalty bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain know-how and patents of Arena to LP352 for any use in humans, LP659 for the treatment of developmental, degenerative and autoimmune disease, disorders or conditions of the CNS or peripheral nervous system in humans and LP143 and certain 5-HT2A compounds for the treatment of CNS indications (excluding the treatment, prevention or amelioration of pain or any gastrointestinal, non-CNS autoimmune or cardiovascular disorder) in humans (pharmaceutical products containing any such compounds, Licensed Products). Arena further granted us a covenant not to sue under any patents or certain information of Arena with respect to each Licensed Product in its respective field. Arena retained the exclusive right to use the licensed intellectual property to

develop, make or use intermediates, pro-drugs and metabolites related to the LP352, LP659, LP143 and 5-HT2A compounds to exploit Arena’s etrasimod, lorcaserin, olorinab, or temanogrel products, in any dosage strength or formulation, and we granted Arena a covenant not to sue with respect to such activities under certain of our intellectual property related to such compounds and the Licensed Products. We will assign to Arena new intellectual property developed by us related to such compounds. We have sole responsibility over development, regulatory and commercialization activities for the Licensed Products in the applicable fields, as well as commercial manufacture and supply therefor. In September 2022, we provided Arena a right of first negotiation, for a specified period of time, to acquire certain development and commercial rights to LP659 products subject to Arena and we mutually agreeing on terms. This right of first negotiation is triggered by our announcing Phase 2 clinical results relating to an LP659 product for an indication that was not in the original field of the license or if we otherwise intend to commence discussions or negotiations to license or partner rights to LP659 in such field.
 
As consideration for the rights granted to us under the Arena License Agreement, we will be required to pay to Arena a mid-single digit royalty on net sales of Licensed Products of LP352, and a low-single digit royalty on net sales of all other Licensed Products, by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees, subject to standard reductions. Our royalty obligations continue on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis until the later of the (i) tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country or (ii) expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the patents licensed to us under the Arena License Agreement covering the manufacture, use or sale of such product in such country, which we expect to run in most jurisdictions until 2036 for LP352, until 2029 for LP659 and 2030 for LP143 without taking into account patent term adjustments or extensions regimes of any country, or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of later filed patent applications. We also will owe Arena up to two $25.0 million commercial sales milestones if nelotanserin products (which are among the licensed 5-HT2A compounds) are developed and achieve annual net sales of $100.0 million and $500.0 million.
 
We may unilaterally terminate the Arena License Agreement for any reason with a specified prior notice period, and Arena may terminate the Arena License Agreement if we challenge any of the licensed patents. Either party may terminate the Arena License Agreement in the event of the other party’s insolvency or for the other party’s uncured material breach of the Arena License Agreement. Absent early termination, the Arena License Agreement will automatically expire upon the expiration of all our payment obligations under the Arena License Agreement.

Royalty Purchase Agreement with Arena
 
In October 2020, we entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement with Arena and 356 Royalty Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Arena (356 Royalty), pursuant to which we purchased the right to receive all milestone payments, royalties, interest and other payments relating to net sales of lorcaserin, in all countries and territories of the world owed or otherwise payable to 356 Royalty by Eisai Inc. and Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai) pursuant to a Transaction Agreement dated December 28, 2016, as amended (Transaction Agreement), by and among 356 Royalty and Eisai, for an upfront payment of approximately $0.1 million. Under the Transaction Agreement, the royalty rates range from 9.5% on annual global net sales less than or equal to $175.0 million, 13.5% on annual global net sales greater than $175.0 million but less than or equal to $500.0 million and 18.5% on annual global net sales greater than $500 million. In addition, we purchased the right to receive a payment of $25.0 million, which will be payable upon the achievement of annual net sales of $250.0 million. Lorcaserin is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial for Dravet syndrome.
Services Agreement with Arena

In October 2020, we entered into a Services Agreement with Arena (Services Agreement) under which Arena agreed to perform certain research and development services, general administrative services, management services and other mutually agreed services for us. The initial term of the Services Agreement was through December 31, 2021, and it then automatically renews for successive one-year terms. Neither party provided notice of non-renewal as of December 31, 2022. Each party may also terminate the Services Agreement for any reason, subject to specified notice periods. During 2022, we significantly reduced our activities under the Services Agreement, including as a result of our having hired employees or contracted with third parties with the requisite expertise, and we are no longer dependent on such services from Arena.
Intellectual Property

Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates and other discoveries, inventions, trade secrets and know-how that are critical to our business operations. Our success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and in part, on our ability to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. A comprehensive discussion on risks relating to intellectual property is provided under the section of this prospectus entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

As of February 1, 2023, we held an exclusive, worldwide license to issued and pending patent claims for compositions of matter and certain methods of treatment using LP352 in several jurisdictions, including issued patents in the United States, Europe (17

countries), China, Japan, India, Russia, South Korea, Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, and Israel, and pending applications in Brazil, Canada, and Macao. The terms of these patents (and applications, if issued) are capable of continuing into 2036, without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country (e.g., up to five additional years in certain jurisdictions if maximum PTE or SPC applies) or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of later filed patent applications. For example, we exclusively license pending patent claims directed to methods of dosing LP352 in a later patent application having a term capable of continuing into 2043 in certain jurisdictions, without taking into account any applicable patent term adjustment or extension.
 
As of February 1, 2023, we held an exclusive, worldwide license to issued and pending patent claims for compositions of matter and certain methods of treatment using LP659 in several jurisdictions, including issued patents in the United States, Europe (39 countries), Brazil, China, Japan, Canada, Russia, South Korea, Australia, Mexico, South Africa, New Zealand, Singapore, Israel. The terms of these patents (and applications, if issued) are capable of continuing into 2029, without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country (e.g., up to five additional years in certain jurisdictions if maximum PTE or SPC applies) or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of later filed patent applications. For example, we exclusively license patent claims for compositions of matter and certain methods of treatment using salt and crystalline forms of LP659 in several jurisdictions, including issued patents in the United States and 10 countries in Europe. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2031 in certain jurisdictions, without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension.
 
In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secret protection, trademark protection and know-how to expand our proprietary position around our chemistry, technology and other discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business. We are a party to a license agreement with Arena under which we are granted intellectual property rights to know-how that are important to our business. We have licensed know-how related to the Licensed Products (including LP352, LP659, LP143 and certain 5-HT2A compounds) in all countries around the world from Arena. The Arena License Agreement imposes various development, regulatory and/or commercial diligence obligations, payment of royalties, including a mid-single digit royalty on net sales of Licensed Products of LP352, and a low-single digit royalty on net sales of all other Licensed Products, by our company, its affiliates or its sublicensees, subject to standard reductions, and other obligations.

We also seek to protect our intellectual property by having confidentiality terms in our agreements with companies with whom we share proprietary and confidential information in the course of business discussions, and by having confidentiality terms in our agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators and other contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors, and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of any discoveries or inventions made by them while in our employ.

Sales and Marketing

Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We intend to build a commercial infrastructure to support sales of any of our approved products. We expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships. While we may commit significant financial and management resources to commercial activities, we will also consider collaborating with one or more pharmaceutical companies to enhance our commercial capabilities.
Manufacturing

We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize. We expect to initially obtain our supplies from manufacturers on a purchase order basis without long-term supply arrangements in place. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and drug product. For all of our product candidates, we intend to identify and qualify manufacturers to provide the APIs and drug product prior to submission of an NDA to the FDA or other marketing authorization applications to other regulatory authorities.

All our product candidates are compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured from readily available starting materials in reliable and reproducible processes that we expect will be amenable to scale-up and will not require specialized equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.

Competition

The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to any other product

candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide.

DEEs are commonly treated with multiple combinations of AEDs though physician preference for administered therapies differs across different epilepsy types. Pharmaceutical companies, such as Lundbeck, Pfizer, and UCB have approved AEDs for the treatment of epilepsies. There are also non-pharmaceutical therapies for epilepsy patients, such as a ketogenic diet, VNS, and surgery for some patients. FINTEPLA (fenfluramine) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in June 2020 and LGS in June 2022 (both include REMS programs). Epidiolex (cannabidiol) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and LGS in 2018, and the treatment of seizures associated with TSC in 2020, and DIACOMIT (stiripentol) was approved by the FDA in 2018 for seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Lorcaserin is also in a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. In addition, other companies are developing therapeutics for the treatment of epilepsies, including alternative approaches such as gene therapy.

In the S1P receptor modulator space, there are four drugs that have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain indications in multiple sclerosis: fingolimod, ozanimod, siponimod and ponesimod. There are multiple additional S1P receptor modulators in development for additional therapeutic indications beyond multiple sclerosis, including in other neurological diseases. There are also numerous other drugs and product candidates in development for indications for which we might develop our product candidates.
 
 Additional potential competitors include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.

There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates for the treatment of the indications that we are pursuing. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, resources and institutional experience. In particular, these companies have greater experience and expertise in securing reimbursement, government contracts, relationships with key opinion leaders, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and distribution relationships to market products, and marketing approved drugs. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do.

The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates are likely to be their efficacy and safety, the scope and limitations of marketing approval, success of regulatory approval, successful protection of our intellectual property, and the availability of funding and reimbursement.

Other drugs, non-pharmaceutical therapies and alternative approaches to indications we may pursue for our drug candidates will compete with us both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval

As a pharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products such as those we are developing. Product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA, before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country specific regulation remains essential in many respects.
U.S. Drug Development Process

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and its implementing regulations. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or

judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 
•completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and other applicable regulations;
 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s good clinical practice (GCP) regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication; 
 
•submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials; 
 
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; 
 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 
•potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA to assess compliance with GCP regulations; 
 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and 
 
•FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 
 
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies, to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research participants provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject inclusion and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

•Phase 1. The drug is initially administered to healthy human participants and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses and if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 
•Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage 


tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.

•Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage and clinical efficacy at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall benefit/risk ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. 
 
Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected AEs or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human participants. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.

In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data need to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s).


The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after the application is submitted. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.

After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions and typically follows the advisory committee’s recommendations.

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application has ended and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may detail required additional clinical data and/or (an) additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug safety and effectiveness, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also determine that a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.

Orphan Drug Designation

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which

the orphan product has exclusivity. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity.

Expedited Development and Review Programs

The FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. With regard to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.

Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.

In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required clinical trials, or if such trials fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.

A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as breakthrough therapy, FDA will expedite the development and review of such drug. Breakthrough therapy designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met.

Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. In addition, such designations or shortened review periods may not provide a material commercial advantage.

Post-Approval Requirements

Any drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products.

In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the drug product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are

required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 
•fines, warning letters, or untitled letters; 
 
•clinical holds on clinical studies; 
 
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
 
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
 
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
 
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labeling.

U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term

extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.

DEA Regulation

The CSA establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances.

Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances.

Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and authorization must be obtained to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.

To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could eventuate in criminal proceedings. Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products.


Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements

Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we are and, upon approval and commercialization, will be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. In the United States, such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws and regulations.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.

Additionally, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

The federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim under the False Claims Act includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act can be enforced through private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the civil False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product and for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.

Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, self-regulatory schemes, regulations, and standards govern the collection of, disclosure of, use of, access to, transfer of, and confidentiality and security of personal information and health-related information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, HIPAA, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and regulations implemented

thereunder, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, as well as their covered subcontractors. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to criminal penalties.
 
 In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. For instance, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in January 2020. The CCPA creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal information of consumers or households. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Further, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) went into effect on January 1, 2023 and modifies significantly the CCPA. Both the CCPA and CPRA could impact our business activities depending on how they are interpreted and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. In addition to California, other states in which we have, or may have in the future, employees or operations, have passed or may pass privacy laws. For example, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah have passed privacy laws that go into effect in 2023, but aspects of these state privacy statutes remain unclear, resulting in further legal uncertainty and potentially requiring us to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply.
 
We also are or will become subject to applicable privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we are established or in which we sell or market our products or run clinical trials. For example, if we conduct EU-based clinical trials, we will be subject to the GDPR in relation to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data of data participants within the European Economic Area (EEA) (i.e. data relating to an identifiable living individual) including the health and medical information of clinical trial participants. The GDPR is directly applicable in each EU and EEA Member State, however, it provides that EU and EEA Member States may introduce further conditions, including limitations which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data (including health and medical information), or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing activities and implement policies as part of its mandated privacy governance framework. It also requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data participants (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal data is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of personal data; defines for the first time pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data; introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements; and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are also subject to EU rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the EU and EEA. We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those EU jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to the GDPR, and may also be subject to the laws of other jurisdictions, such as Switzerland, which may have their own set of stringent privacy and data protection laws and regulations. For example, the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (DPA) applies to the collection and processing of personal data, including health-related information, in certain circumstances, for companies conducting business in Switzerland or with Swiss companies or individuals. The DPA has been revised and adopted by the Swiss Parliament, and the revised law may result in an increase of costs of compliance, risks of noncompliance and penalties for noncompliance. Fines for certain breaches of the GDPR are significant: up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total global annual turnover. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR or other applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our use of data, enforcement notices, or potential civil claims including class action type litigation.

In addition, we may be unable to transfer personal data from Europe and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries due to data localization requirements or limitations on cross-border data flows. Europe and other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal data to other countries. In particular, the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) have significantly restricted the transfer of personal data to the United States and other countries whose privacy laws it believes are inadequate. Other jurisdictions may adopt similarly stringent interpretations of their data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and UK to the United States in compliance with law, such as the EEA and UK’s standard contractual clauses, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to

lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. If there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal data from the EEA, the UK, or other jurisdictions to the United States, or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate part of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant expense, increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work with partners, vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of personal data necessary to operate our business. Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations.
 
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration made to physicians and other healthcare providers, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products.

In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We or our collaborators may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

If we elect to participate in certain governmental programs, we may be required to participate in discount and rebate programs, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. For example, drug manufacturers participating under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program must pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs.

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these

countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

Healthcare Reform

A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and applying new payment methodologies.

For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively ACA), was enacted, which affected existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and it is unclear how such litigation and other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA or our business. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program.
 
Other legislative changes relating to healthcare have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted, and there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which pharmaceutical companies set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders, and proposed federal legislation, as well as state efforts, designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, the IRA also, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023. The IRA is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry.

We anticipate that these new laws will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we or our potential collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the

United States have a similar process that requires the submission of an application for a clinical trial authorization (CTA) much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an application made to an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements and a favorable ethics committee opinion has been issued, clinical trial development may proceed.

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures.

Centralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid in all EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases, other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for other products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health or which contain a new active substance for indications other than those specified to be compulsory.

National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
 
•Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorizations in more than one EU Member State of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU Member State and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. 
 
•Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 
 
The EMA grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition in the EU and without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the investment required to develop the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the EU of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for free or reduced-fee protocol assistance, fee reductions for marketing authorization applications and other post-authorization activities and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval, which can be extended to 12 years if trials are conducted in accordance with an agreed-upon pediatric investigational plan. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Human Capital and Employee Engagement
 
We believe that our success largely depends upon attracting and retaining a highly skilled team with key expertise in our areas of therapeutic focus. We are committed to creating and maintaining a culture that is positive, diverse, inclusive and dynamic. Our human capital priorities include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, developing and integrating our existing and

future employees. We provide our employees competitive base salaries, as well as a cash target bonus, a robust benefits package and equity compensation. In addition, we regularly conduct an employee survey to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of potential improvement.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 33 employees, 32 of whom are full-time, consisting of clinical, research and manufacturing, operations, finance and business personnel. Fifteen of our employees hold either an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Facilities

We entered into a two-year lease for certain office space in La Jolla, California in June 2021. Rent payments were approximately $29,000 per month for the first year and increased by 4.5% in July 2022. In August 2022, we extended the lease agreement (lease extension) through December 31, 2024. Rent payments under the lease extension are approximately $33,000 starting in July 2023 and increase by 4.5% in July 2024. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current needs, and that suitable additional alternative spaces will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
