SATIVUS TECH CORP. (formerly SEEDO CORP.) (the “Company”, “Our” or “We”) was formed on January 16, 2015, under the laws of the State of Delaware. Prior to July 2020, we were involved in producing a plant growing device managed and controlled by an artificial intelligent algorithm, allowing consumers to grow their own herbs and vegetables effortlessly from seed to plant, while providing optimal conditions to assure premium quality produce year-round. However, due to financial and operational difficulties and during 2020, we ceased these operations and on July 19, 2020, the Company formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary in Israel, Hachevra Legiduley Pkaot Beisrael Ltd. (the “New Subsidiary”), to develop a fully automated and remotely managed system for growing saffron and other vegetables. On November 5, 2020, the New Subsidiary changed its name to Saffron-Tech Ltd. (or “Saffron Tech”). As of the date of this report, and following various financings in Saffron Tech, the Company owns 54% of Saffron Tech.
