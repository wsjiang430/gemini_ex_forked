ITEM 1.
OVERVIEWAND CORPORATE STRUCTURE
 Presidio Property Trust, Inc. (“we”, “our”, “us” or the “Company”) is a self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”). We were incorporated in the State of California on September 28, 1999, and in August 2010, we reincorporated as a Maryland corporation. In October 2017, we changed our name from “NetREIT, Inc.” to “Presidio Property Trust, Inc.” As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 17.7 million shares of Series A Common Stock outstanding with approximately 3,040 stockholders, none of which owned more than 5.0% of the outstanding shares. We are a non-traded, publicly owned company registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Through the Company, its subsidiaries and its partnerships, we own 18 commercial properties in fee interest and have partial interests in one commercial property through our investments in limited partnerships for which we serve as the general partner. We purchased the partnership interest in one limited partnership that owned one property during 2016. Each of the limited partnerships is referred to as a “DownREIT.” In each DownREIT, we have the right, through put and call options, to require our co-investors to exchange their interests for shares of our common stock at a stated price after a defined period (generally five years from the date they first invested in the entity’s real property), the occurrence of a specified event or a combination thereof. The Company is a limited partner in four partnerships and one limited liability corporation that purchase and leaseback model homes from homebuilders.
MARKET AND BUSINESS STRATEGY
 The Company invests in a diverse multi-tenant portfolio of real estate assets. Beginning in 2015, we began to focus our commercial portfolio primarily on office and industrial properties (“Office/Industrial Properties”) and model homes (“Model Home Properties”), and have been managing the portfolio to transition out of retail properties. Our commercial properties are currently located in Southern California, Colorado and North Dakota. Our commercial property tenant base is highly diversified and consists of approximately 223 individual commercial tenants with an average remaining lease term of approximately 1.1 years as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, one commercial tenant represented more than 5.0% of our annualized base rent, while our ten largest tenants represented approximately 28.3% of our annualized base rent. In addition, our commercial property tenant base has limited exposure to any single industry. 
 Our main objective is to maximize long-term stockholder value through the acquisition, management, leasing and selective redevelopment of high-quality office and industrial properties. We focus on regionally dominant markets across the United States which we believe have attractive growth dynamics driven in part by important economic factors such as strong office-using employment growth; net in-migration of a highly educated workforce; a large student population; the stability provided by healthcare systems, government or other large institutional employer presence; low rates of unemployment; and lower cost of living versus gateway markets. We seek to maximize returns through investments in markets with limited supply, high barriers to entry, and stable and growing employment drivers. Our model home portfolio supports the objective of maximizing stockholder value by focusing on purchasing new single-family model homes and leasing them back to experienced homebuilders.  We operate the model home portfolio in markets where we can diversify by geography, builder size, and model home purchase price.

Dispositions 
 We review our portfolio of investment properties for value appreciation potential on an ongoing basis, and dispose of any properties that no longer satisfy our requirements in this regard, taking into account tax and other considerations. The proceeds from any such property sale, after repayment of any associated mortgage, are available for investing in properties that we believe will have a greater likelihood of future price appreciation. We disposed of the following properties during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:

Model Home Properties
 Our Model Home properties are located in 10 states throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 144 model homes with a net book value of approximately $48.8 million.
 NetREIT Dubose Model Home REIT, Inc. (“NetREIT Dubose”) is engaged in the business of acquiring model homes from third party homebuilders in sale-leaseback transactions whereby a homebuilder sells the Model Home to NetREIT Dubose and leases back the Model Home under a triple net lease (“NNN”) for use in marketing its residential development. Our Model Home business was started in March 2010 through the acquisition of certain assets and rights from Dubose Model Homes USA. Subsequent to its formation, NetREIT Dubose raised $10.6 million pursuant to a private placement of its common stock (the private placement terminated on December 31, 2013). As of December 31, 2018, the Company has a net investment of $1.2 million in NetREIT Dubose through the purchase of common stock. We owned approximately 27.2% of NetREIT Dubose as of December 31, 2018.
 We operate four limited partnerships in connection with NetREIT Dubose, Dubose Model Home Investors #202, LP (“DMHI #202”), Dubose Model Home Investors #203, LP (“DMHI #203”), Dubose Model Home Investors #204, LP (“DMHI #204”) and NetREIT Dubose Model Home REIT, LP. The limited partnerships typically raise private equity to invest in Model Home Properties and lease them back to the homebuilders. As of December 31, 2018 the Company owned:

• | 10.3% of DMHI #202. The partnership raised $2.9 million, including our investment. This partnership was formed to raise up to $5.0 million through the sale of units. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 2.3% of DMHI #203. The partnership raised $2.2 million, including our investment. This partnership was formed to raise up to $5.0 million through the sale of units. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 3.6% of DMHI #204. The partnership raised $2.8 million, including our investment. This partnership was formed to raise up to $5.0 million through the sale of units. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 100% of NetREIT Model Homes, LLC.
--+----------------------------------

 NetREIT Dubose owned 100 % of NetREIT Dubose Model Home REIT LP.  
 We provide management services to our limited partnerships through NetREIT Advisors, LLC (“NetREIT Advisors”) and Dubose Advisors LLC (“Dubose Advisors”). These entities are 100% owned subsidiaries and are referred to collectively as the (“Advisors”). For their services, each of the Advisors receives ongoing management fees, acquisition fees and has the right to receive certain other fees when a partnership sells or otherwise disposes of a Model Home. NetREIT Advisors manages NetREIT Dubose and NetREIT Model Homes, LLC and Dubose Advisors manages DMHI #202, DMHI #203 and DMHI #204.

Use of Leverage
 The Company’s 16,900 shares of Series B Preferred Stock are mandatorily redeemable by the Company on August 1, 2019 (“Mandatory Redemption Date”) for $16.9 million in cash plus any accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2018 the Company did not have sufficient cash on hand and is not expected to generate enough cash to redeem such shares. It is management’s intent to obtain additional borrowing under secured or unsecured indebtedness, sell properties, or reduce the rate of distributions to the stockholders in order to obtain proceeds sufficient to settle this obligation. Under the terms of our Series B Preferred Stock financing, if there is an event of default, the investor may exercise various remedies, including a change of control via replacing a majority of the Board of Directors. If we fail to comply with the payment obligations, then we may trigger an event of default.  The terms of our Series B Preferred Stock financing (“Investor Agreement”) provide that, upon the occurrence of an event of default (including a failure to comply with payment obligations), the investor will have the right to take the unilateral action to, or cause the Company to, among other things:

• | Replace property managers and leasing agents;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Following 180 days after the Mandatory Redemption Date, sell any property of the Company, except as otherwise required under applicable law;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implement all major decisions listed above and in the Investor Agreement, except as otherwise required under applicable law;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Refinance, repay or prepay any senior loans of the Company;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cure any default under any senior loans of the Company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effect a change in control by replacing six individuals to serve as members of the Board of Directors of the Company.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ability of our investor to replace a majority of our Board of Directors upon an event of default would give control of the Company to the investor.  Such a change of control, or the exercise of other rights upon an event of default, could result in a material adverse effect on us, including our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 We have $9.9 million of mortgage notes payable maturing in 2019 related to the model home properties.  We plan to refinance a significant portion of the mortgage notes payable or sell the model home properties to repay the mortgage notes payable.
 Our short term liquidity needs include satisfying the debt service requirements of our existing mortgages. If our cash flow from operating activities is not sufficient to fund our short term liquidity needs, we will fund a portion of these needs from additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness, from real estate sales, or we will reduce the rate of distribution to the stockholders.  
 We use mortgage loans secured by our individual properties in order to maximize the return for our stockholders. Typically these loans are for terms ranging from five to ten years. Currently, the majority of our mortgage loans are structured as non-recourse to us with limited exceptions that would cause a recourse event only upon occurrence of certain fraud, misconduct, environmental, or bankruptcy events. Non-recourse financing limits our exposure to the amount of equity invested in each property pledged as collateral thereby protecting the equity in our other assets. We can provide no assurance that the non-recourse financing will be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all and there may be circumstances where lenders have recourse to our other assets. To a lesser extent, we use recourse financing or a cross collateral pledge of certain properties. At December 31, 2018, $38.7 million of our total debt of $151.1 million was recourse to the Company of which $32.7 million relates to the model homes properties.
 We have used both fixed and variable interest rate debt to finance our properties. Wherever possible, we prefer to obtain fixed rate mortgage financing as it provides better cost predictability. As of December 31, 2018, we have one mortgage loan which includes variable interest rate provisions.
 PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
 The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, NTR Property Management, Inc., is the primary property manager for all of its properties.  The Company subcontracts with third party property management companies in Colorado and North Dakota to render on-site management services.

COMPETITION
 We compete with a number of other real estate investors, many of whom own similar properties in the same geographical markets. Competitors include other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic location of its investments. In addition, many of these competitors have capital structures that allow them to make investments at higher prices than what we can prudently offer while still generating a return to their investors that is commensurate with the return we are seeking to provide our investors. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge or to offer more substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below-market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our leases expire. The concentration of our commercial properties in Colorado and North Dakota makes us susceptible to local market conditions in these areas. 
 To be successful, we must be able to continue to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local and regional economic conditions by adjusting rental rates of our properties as appropriate. If we are unable to respond quickly and effectively, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and pay dividends may be adversely affected.
 REGULATION
 Our management continually reviews our investment activity and monitors the proportion of our portfolio that is placed in various investments in order to prevent us from coming within the application of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). If at any time the character of our investments could cause us to be deemed an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to comply with the operating restrictions of the Investment Company Act, which are generally inconsistent with our normal operations. As such, we work to ensure that we are not deemed to be an “investment company.” 
 Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our properties. Such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to tenants about the lead-based paint) and waste-management activities. Our failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party. 
 To date, we have not experienced a noticeable effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position as a result of a lack of compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations. All of our proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to such acquisition. These inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review in detail their reports prior to our acquisition of any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we may be required to abandon otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials are considered to be prohibitive or we are unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our current properties. We believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards. 
 We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our current properties that, individually or in the aggregate, may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition or our results of operations. Future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or liquidity.

 OUR REIT STATUS
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2000. To continue to be taxed as a REIT, we must satisfy numerous organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code (“the code”) and calculated on an annual basis. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any year, our income will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify. Even though we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
