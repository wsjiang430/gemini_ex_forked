GENERAL INFORMATION
MGP is a leading producer and supplier of premium distilled spirits and specialty wheat protein and starch food ingredients. Distilled spirits include premium bourbon and rye whiskeys and grain neutral spirits ("GNS"), including vodka and gin. MGP is also a top producer of high quality industrial alcohol for use in both food and non-food applications. Our protein and starch food ingredients provide a host of functional, nutritional, and sensory benefits for a wide range of food products to serve the packaged goods industry. Our distillery products are derived from corn and other grains, and our ingredient products are derived from wheat flour. The majority of our distillery and ingredient product sales are made directly, or through distributors, to manufacturers and processors of finished packaged goods or to bakeries. 
INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

As of December 31, 2018, we had two reportable segments: distillery products and ingredient solutions.
Distillery Products Segment.  We process corn and other grains (including rye, barley, wheat, barley malt, and milo) into food grade alcohol and distillery co-products, such as distillers feed (commonly called dried distillers grain in the industry), fuel grade alcohol, and corn oil. We also provide warehouse services, including barrel put away, barrel storage, and barrel retrieval services. We have certain contracts with customers to supply distilled products (or "distillate"), as well as certain contracts with customers to provide barreling and warehousing services.  Contracts with customers may be monthly, annual, and multi-year with periodic reviews of pricing.  Sales of fuel grade alcohol are made on the spot market.  Since 2015, our distillery products segment includes production and sales of our own branded alcohol products, including sales under the TILL® American Wheat Vodka, George Remus® Straight Bourbon Whiskey, Remus Repeal Reserve® Straight Bourbon Whiskey, Tanner's Creek® Blended Bourbon Whiskey, Rossville Union® Master Crafted Straight Rye Whiskey, and Eight & Sand Blended Bourbon Whiskey brands. During 2018, our five largest distillery products customers, combined, accounted for 22.8 percent of our consolidated net sales.
Food Grade Alcohol - The majority of our distillery capacities are dedicated to the production of high quality, high purity food grade alcohol for beverage and industrial applications.
Food grade alcohol sold for beverage applications, premium beverage alcohol, consists primarily of premium bourbon and rye whiskeys ("brown goods") and GNS, including vodka and gin ("white goods").  Our premium bourbon is created by distilling grains, primarily corn.  Our whiskey is made from fermented grain mash, including rye and corn. Our whiskeys are primarily sold as unaged new distillate, which are then aged by our customers from two to four years and are sold at various proof concentrations. Our GNS is sold in bulk quantities at various proof concentrations. Our gin is created by redistilling GNS together with proprietary formulations of botanicals or botanical oils.

Food grade industrial alcohol is used as an ingredient in foods (e.g., vinegar and food flavorings), personal care products (e.g., hair sprays and hand sanitizers), cleaning solutions, pharmaceuticals, and a variety of other products.  We sell food grade industrial alcohol in tank truck or rail car quantities direct to a number of industrial processors.
Fuel grade alcohol - Fuel grade alcohol is sold primarily for blending with gasoline to increase the octane and oxygen levels of the gasoline.  As an octane enhancer, fuel grade alcohol can serve as a substitute for lead and petroleum-based octane enhancers.  As an oxygenate, fuel grade alcohol has been used in gasoline to meet certain environmental regulations and laws relating to air quality by reducing carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon particulates, and other toxic emissions generated from the burning of gasoline. We produce fuel grade alcohol as a co-product of our food grade alcohol business at our Atchison facility.

Distillers Feed and related Co-Products - The bulk alcohol co-products sales include distillers feed and corn oil. Distillers feed is principally derived from the mash from alcohol processing operations.  The mash is dried and sold primarily to processors of animal feeds as a high protein additive.  In addition, we produce corn oil as a value added co-product through a corn oil extraction process at our Atchison facility.

Warehouse Services - Customers who purchase unaged barreled distillate may, and in most cases do, also enter into separate warehouse service agreements with us for the storage of product for aging that include services for barrel put away, barrel storage, and barrel retrieval.
Ingredient Solutions Segment.  Our ingredient solutions segment consists primarily of specialty wheat starches, specialty wheat proteins, commodity wheat starches, and commodity wheat proteins. Contracts with ingredients customers are generally price, volume, and term agreements, which are fixed-term contracts, with very few agreements longer than 12 months in duration.  During 2018, our five largest ingredient solutions customers, combined, accounted for 10.5 percent of our consolidated net sales.
Specialty Wheat Starches - Wheat starch is derived from the carbohydrate-bearing portion of wheat flour.  We produce a premium wheat starch powder by extracting the starch from the starch slurry, substantially free of all impurities and fibers, and then dry the starch in spray, flash, or drum dryers.
A substantial portion of our premium wheat starch is altered during processing to produce certain unique specialty wheat starches designed for special applications.  We sell our specialty wheat starches on a global basis, primarily to food processors and distributors.
We market our specialty wheat starches under the trademarks Fibersym® Resistant Starch series, FiberRite® RW Resistant Starch, Pregel® Instant Starch series, and Midsol® Cook-up Starch series. They are used primarily for food applications as an ingredient in a variety of food products to affect their nutritional profile, appearance, texture, tenderness, taste, palatability, cooking temperature, stability, viscosity, binding, and freeze-thaw characteristics.  Important physical properties contributed by wheat starch include whiteness, clean flavor, viscosity, and texture.  For example, our starches are used to improve the taste and texture of cream puffs, éclairs, puddings, pie fillings, breading, and batters; to improve the size, symmetry, and taste of angel food cakes; to alter the viscosity of soups, sauces, and gravies; to improve the freeze-thaw stability and shelf life of fruit pies and other frozen foods; to improve moisture retention in microwavable foods; and to add stability and to improve spreadability in frostings, mixes, glazes, and sugar coatings.

Our wheat starches, as a whole, generally compete primarily with corn starch, which dominates the United States starch market.  However, the unique characteristics of our specialty wheat starches provide a number of advantages over corn and other starches for certain baking and other end uses. 

Specialty Wheat Proteins - We have developed a number of specialty wheat proteins for food applications. Specialty wheat proteins are derived from vital wheat gluten through a variety of proprietary processes which change its molecular structure.  Specialty wheat proteins for food applications include the products Arise® and Trutex®. 
We produce clean label ingredients under our Arise® line of wheat protein isolates. Along with Arise® 8000, this series includes Arise® 8100 and Arise® 8200. Each of these ingredients is also Non-GMO ("Non-Genetically Modified Organism") Project Verified. We also offer a Non-GMO Project Verified food ingredients portfolio of TruTex® 751, TruTex® 1501, TruTex® 2240, and TruTex® Redishred 65 textured wheat proteins.

Our specialty wheat proteins generally compete with other ingredients and modified proteins having similar characteristics, primarily soy proteins and other wheat proteins, with differentiation being based on factors such as functionality, price, and, in the case of food applications, flavor.
Commodity Wheat Starches - As is the case with value added wheat starches, our commodity wheat starches have both food and non-food applications, but such applications are more limited than those of value added wheat starches and typically sell for a lower price in the marketplace.  Commodity wheat starches compete primarily with corn starches, which dominate the marketplace and prices generally track the fluctuations in the corn starch market.
Commodity Wheat Proteins - Commodity wheat protein, or vital wheat gluten, is a free-flowing light tan powder which contains approximately 70 to 80 percent protein.  When we process wheat flour to derive starch, we also derive vital wheat gluten.  Vital wheat gluten is added by bakeries and food processors to baked goods, such as breads, and to pet foods, cereals, processed meats, and fish and poultry to improve the nutritional content, texture, strength, shape, and volume of the product.  The neutral flavor and color of vital wheat gluten also enhances the flavor and color of certain foods.  The cohesiveness and elasticity of the gluten enables the dough in wheat and other high protein breads to rise and to support added ingredients, such as whole cracked grains, raisins and fibers.  This allows bakers to make an array of different breads by varying the gluten content of the dough.  Vital wheat gluten is also added to white breads, hot dog buns, and hamburger buns to improve the strength and cohesiveness of the product.
COMPETITIVE CONDITION
While we believe that the overall market environment offers considerable growth opportunities for us in 2019 and beyond, the markets in which our products are sold are competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies. In our distillery products segment, competition is based primarily on product innovation, product characteristics, functionality, price, service, and quality factors, such as flavor. In our ingredient solutions segment, competition is based primarily on product innovation, product characteristics, price, name, color, flavor, or other properties that affect how the ingredient is being used.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND LICENSES

We are involved in a number of patent-related activities, primarily within our ingredient solutions segment.  We have filed patent applications to protect a range of inventions made in our research and development efforts, including inventions relating to applications for our products.  Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products.
SEASONALITY

Our sales are generally not seasonal.
TRANSPORTATION

Historically, our output has been transported to customers by truck and rail, most of which is provided by common carriers. We use third party transportation companies to help us manage truck and rail carriers who deliver our products to our North American customers. 
RAW MATERIALS, PACKAGING MATERIALS, AND FOOD GRADE ALCOHOL
Our principal distillery products segment raw materials, or input costs, are corn and other grains (including rye, barley, wheat, barley malt, and milo), which are processed into food grade alcohol and distillery co-products consisting of distillers feed, fuel grade alcohol, and corn oil. Our principal ingredient solutions segment raw material is wheat flour, which is processed into starches and proteins.  The cost of grain has, at times, been subject to substantial fluctuation. 
In 2018, we purchased most of our grain requirements from two suppliers, Bunge Milling, Inc. ("Bunge") and Consolidated Grain and Barge Co. ("CGB"). Our current grain supply contracts with Bunge and CGB expire on December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Through these contracts, we purchase grain for delivery into the future at negotiated prices based on several factors.  We also order wheat flour for delivery into the future at negotiated prices based on several factors.  We provide for our wheat flour requirements through a supply contract with Ardent Mills, which expires August 20, 2023. We typically enter contracts for future delivery only to protect margins on contracted alcohol sales, expected ingredient sales, and general usage.

Our principal packaging material for our distillery products segment is oak barrels. Both new and used barrels are utilized for the aging of premium bourbon and rye whiskeys. We purchase oak barrels from multiple suppliers and some customers supply their own barrels.
We also source food grade alcohol from Pacific Ethanol Central, LLC ("Pacific Ethanol"), formerly Illinois Corn Processing, LLC ("ICP"), which was our 30 percent-owned joint venture until July 3, 2017 when it was divested and sold to Pacific Ethanol (Note 4 and Note 10).
ENERGY

Natural gas is an input cost used to operate boilers to make steam heat.  We procure natural gas for our facilities in the open market from various suppliers.  We have a risk management program whereby we may purchase contracts for the delivery of natural gas for delivery into the future at negotiated prices based on several factors, or we can purchase futures contracts on the exchange.  Historically, prices of natural gas have been higher in the late fall and winter months than during other periods. 
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 332 employees.  A collective bargaining agreement covering 105 employees at the Atchison facility expires on August 31, 2019.  A collective bargaining agreement covering 64 employees at the Lawrenceburg facility expires on December 31, 2022.  We consider our relations with our personnel generally to be good.
REGULATION

We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment.  Our operations are also subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau ("TTB"), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"), the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), and by various state and local authorities.  Such laws and regulations cover virtually every aspect of our operations, including production and storage facilities, distillation and maturation requirements, importing ingredients, distribution of beverage alcohol products, marketing, pricing, labeling, packaging, advertising, water usage, waste water discharge, disposal of hazardous wastes and emissions, and other matters. In addition, beverage alcohol products are subject to customs duties or excise taxation in many countries, including taxation at the federal, state, and local level in the United States.
EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS
Illinois Corn Processing, LLC ("ICP"). In November 2009, we completed a series of transactions to form ICP, which produced high quality food grade alcohol, chemical intermediates, and fuel. In connection with these transactions, we entered into agreements with ICP and ICP Holdings, an affiliate of SEACOR Holdings, Inc. One of the agreements was the LLC Interest Purchase Agreement under which we sold ICP Holdings 50 percent of the membership interest in ICP.  This agreement also gave ICP Holdings the option to purchase up to an additional 20 percent of the membership interest in ICP, and on February 1, 2012, ICP Holdings exercised its option and purchased an additional 20 percent from us, reducing our ownership from 50 percent to 30 percent.
On July 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our 30 percent equity ownership interest in ICP to Pacific Ethanol pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Merger Agreement") entered into on June 26, 2017. Illinois Corn Processing Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of SEACOR Holdings, Inc., held the remaining equity in ICP that was also sold pursuant to the Merger Agreement (Note 4).
D.M. Ingredients GmbH ("DMI").  Our joint venture terminated effective June 30, 2015, with a return of investment on December 23, 2016 (Note 4).
