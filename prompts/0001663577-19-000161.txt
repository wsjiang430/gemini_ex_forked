Acquisitions
 
Rocky Mountain High Water Company LLC
 
In July 2016, the Company entered into a business alliance with Poafpybitty Family, LLC to launch Eagle Spirit Spring Water, a line of purified, high-alkaline spring water sourced from Native American tribal land in Oklahoma.

4
-


The agreement calls for the Company to pay a royalty on each gallon of water collected at the spring. Production of filtered spring water filled bottles commenced in August 2016 and sales began in October 2016.
 
In consideration for the 20-year water and surface rights, and a related 10-year renewal option, the Company paid Poafpybitty Family, LLC cash payments of $22,500 and issued a warrant for 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock exercisable at $.03 per share over a three-year period beginning July 27, 2016.
 
The agreement grants the Company an exclusive right to develop land adjacent to the spring for commercial purposes as agreed to by both parties. Additionally, the Company has agreed to grow hemp for experimental or commercial purposes on the land within three years.
 
On November 12, 2016, the agreement with the Poafpybitty Family was amended to give the Company a controlling voting interest of 75% of WaterCo, while the Poafpybitty Family received a majority 51% of the equity interest. The amended agreement is being accounted for as a step-acquisition, with the resulting goodwill of $59,163 included in other assets. During the six months ended December 31, 2017, the Company obtained an outside valuation of the rights to use the land and obtain the water described in the agreement. As a result of that analysis and the continued operating losses by the Company’s spring water business, the Company determined that its investment, including the related goodwill, was fully impaired. The Company recorded an impairment expense of $59,163 as of November 12, 2017. As a result of the step-acquisition, beginning on November 12, 2016 the operations of WaterCo are consolidated in the financial statements of RMHB.
 
FitWhey Brands Inc. (acquisition of the assets of BFIT Brands, LLC)
 
In July 2018, the Company purchased the assets of BFIT Brands, LLC, an Arizona-based company. The acquired assets include the cash, accounts receivable, inventory, FitWhey trademark, recipes and formulas of BFIT’s FitWhey branded water-based protein drinks containing caffeine and a vitamin-B pack. The Company paid $230,438 including common stock issued to the owners of BFIT of $75,000, forgiveness of a note receivable of $80,000 plus accrued interest of $438, and $75,000 to be paid to the owners of BFIT over time based on 5% of net sales of FitWhey products. The acquisition includes $98,297 of assets including cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid production costs and $132,141 of intangible assets, including the FitWhey software, trademark, formulas, and goodwill. The Company is obtaining an outside valuation of these assets.

Regulatory Requirements
 
We are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to:
 

• | The production of beverages and other related products; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The preparation and sale of beverage; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Environmental protection; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Interstate commerce and taxation laws; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Workplace and safety conditions, minimum wage and other labor requirements 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company’s hemp and CBD products are derived from industrial hemp, not marijuana. There is a clear scientific distinction between the two plants: The Company’s products contain less than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), the psychoactive compound found in marijuana. (Most marijuana contains over 10% THC). There is also a clear legal distinction between the two plants. While marijuana is illegal under U.S. federal law, the industrial hemp used in our products is 100% legal at the federal level. It is grown under a duly-licensed state agricultural pilot program conducted by the Colorado Department of Agriculture, as authorized by the 2014 U.S. Farm Bill. The Farm Bill explicitly exempts hemp products from the definition of “marijuana” and explicitly exempts hemp products from the purview and regulation of the Controlled Substances Act. Furthermore, the 2016 Omnibus Appropriations Act specifically instructs federal agencies not to interfere with the transport or sale of pilot program hemp products such as the ones sold by the Company. The 2018 Farm Bill specifically removed hemp from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act. The law also prohibits states from interfering with the transportation of hemp and hemp products from one state to another.
 
Our beverage products are not subject to direct FDA approval as the FDA does not perform review testing or approval of food, beverages or dietary supplements. The FDA requires that we manufacture our products in commercial manufacturing facilities that are annually audited to ensure that they pass inspection based on Good Manufacturing Practices for food safety.

Employees and Independent Contractors
 
The Company currently has four officers and five non-officer employees. The Company uses independent contractors, when necessary, to support operational or back-office functions.
 
Implications of Emerging Growth Company Status
 
As a company with less than $1 billion in revenue in our last fiscal year, we are defined as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act. We will retain “emerging growth company” status until the earliest of:

• | The last day of the fiscal year during which our annual revenues are equal to or exceed $1 billion;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first sale of common stock pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to in this document as the Securities Act;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in a previous three-year period; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The date on which we qualify as a large accelerated filer under Rule 12b-2 adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (i.e., an issuer with a public float of $700 million that has been filing reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Exchange Act for at least 12 months).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to SEC reporting companies. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company we will not be required to:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2002;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder non-binding advisory votes;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submit for stockholder approval golden parachute payments not previously approved;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disclose certain executive compensation related items, as we will be subject to the scaled disclosure requirements of a smaller reporting company with respect to executive compensation disclosure; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Present more than two years of audited financial statements and two years of selected financial data in a registration statement for our initial public offering of our securities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of The JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt into the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
 
Because the worldwide market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, is below $75 million, we are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined under the Exchange Act. Some of the foregoing reduced disclosure and other requirements are also available to us because we are a smaller reporting company and may continue to be available to us even after we are no longer an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act but remain a smaller reporting company under the Exchange Act. As a smaller reporting company we are not required to:
 

• | Have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Present more than two years of audited financial statements in our registration statements and annual reports on Form 10-K and present any selected financial data in such registration statements and annual reports.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
