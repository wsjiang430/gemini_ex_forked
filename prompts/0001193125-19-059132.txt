Item 1. Business 
Company Overview 
 Marcus & Millichap, Inc. (MMI) is a leading national real estate services firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing, research and advisory services. We are the leading national investment brokerage company in the $1-$10 million private client market segment. This is the largest and most active market segment and comprised approximately 84% of total U.S. commercial property transactions greater than $1 million in the marketplace in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had nearly 2,000 investment sales and financing professionals that are primarily exclusive independent contractors who provide real estate investment brokerage and financing services to sellers and buyers of commercial real estate. In 2018, we closed 9,472 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $46.4 billion. 
 We service clients by underwriting, marketing, selling and financing commercial real estate properties in a manner that maximizes value for sellers and provides buyers with the largest and most diverse inventory of commercial properties. Our business model is based on several key attributes: 
 

 | a 48-year history of providing investment brokerage and financing services through proprietary inventory and marketing systems, policies and culture of information sharing and in-depth investment brokerage training, all of which are executed under the supervision of a dedicated management team focused on client service and growing the firm;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | market leading share and brand within the $1-$10 million private client market segment, which consistently represents more than 80% of total U.S. commercial property transactions greater than $1 million in the marketplace;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | nearly 2,000 investment sales and financing professionals providing consistent services and exclusive client representation across multiple property types;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a broad geographic platform consisting of 80 offices in the United States and Canada powered by information sharing and proprietary real estate marketing technologies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | an ability to scale with our private clients as they grow and connect private capital with larger assets through our Institutional Property Advisors (IPA) group;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a financing team integrated with our brokerage sales force providing independent mortgage brokerage services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | an experienced management team overseeing our offices, with an average of approximately 11 years of real estate investment brokerage experience with our Company;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our managers not competing with or participating in investment sales professionals commissions, because they are in a support and leadership role as company executives; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | industry-leading research and advisory services tailored to the needs of our clients and supporting our investment sales and financing professionals.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Services 
 We generate revenues by collecting real estate brokerage commissions upon the sale, and fees upon the financing, of commercial properties, and by providing consulting and advisory services. Real estate brokerage

  commissions are typically based upon the value of the property, and financing fees are typically based upon the size of the loan. In 2018, approximately 92% of our revenues were generated from real estate brokerage commissions, 7% from financing fees and 1% from other revenues, including consulting and advisory services. 
 We divide commercial real estate into four major market segments, characterized by price in order to understand trends in our revenue from period to period: 
 

 | Properties priced less than $1 million;
--+----------------------------------------


 | Private client market: properties priced from $1 million up to $10 million;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Middle market: properties priced from $10 million up to $20 million; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Larger transaction market: properties priced from $20 million and above.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We serve clients with one property, multiple properties and large investment portfolios. The largest group of investors we serve typically transacts in the $1-$10 million private client market segment. The investment brokerage and financing businesses serving private clients within the private client market segment represents the largest part of our business, which differentiates us from our competitors. In 2018, approximately 65% of our brokerage commissions came from this market segment. Properties in this market segment are characterized by higher asset turnover rates due to the type of investor as compared to other market segments. Private clients are often motivated to buy, sell and/or refinance properties not only for business reasons but also due to personal circumstances, such as death, divorce, changes in partnership structures and other personal or financial circumstances. Therefore, private client investors are influenced less by the macroeconomic trends than other large-scale investors, making the private client market segment less volatile over the long-term than other market segments. Accordingly, our business model distinguishes us from our national competitors, who may focus primarily on the more volatile larger transaction market segment, or on other business activities such as leasing or property management, and from our local and regional competitors, who lack a broad national platform. 
 Geographic Locations 
 We were founded in 1971 in the western United States, and we continue to increase our presence throughout North America through execution of our growth strategies by targeting markets based on population, employment, level of commercial real estate sales, inventory and competitive landscape opportunities where we believe the markets will benefit from our business model. We have grown to have offices in 35 states across the United States and in 4 provinces in Canada, encompassing 59 offices in major metropolitan markets and 21 offices in mid-market locations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed acquisitions that expanded our IPA business and expanded our presence in the financing market in the Midwest and in the real estate brokerage market in Canada.

Commercial Real Estate Investment Brokerage 
 Our primary business and source of revenue is the representation of commercial property owners as their exclusive investment broker in the sale of their properties. Our investment sales professionals also represent buyers in fulfilling their investment real estate acquisition needs. Commissions from real estate investment brokerage sales accounted for approximately 92% of our revenues in 2018. Sales are generated by maintaining relationships with property owners, providing market information and trends to them during their investment or hold period and being selected as their representative when they decide to sell, buy additional property or exchange their property for another property. We collect commissions upon the sale of each property based on a percentage of sales price. These commission percentages are typically inversely correlated with sales price and thus are generally higher for smaller transactions. 
 We underwrite, value, position and market properties to reach the largest and most qualified pool of buyers. We offer our clients the industrys largest team of investment sales professionals, who operate with a culture and policy of information sharing powered by our proprietary system, MNet, which enables real-time buyer-seller matching. We use a proactive marketing campaign that leverages the investor relationships of our entire sales force, direct marketing and a suite of proprietary web-based tools that connects each asset with the right buyer pool. We strive to maximize value for the seller by generating high demand for each property. Our approach also provides a diverse, consistently underwritten inventory of investment real estate for buyers. When a client engages one of our investment sales professionals, they are engaging an entire system, structure and organization committed to maximizing value for them.

 In 2018, we closed 7,079 real estate brokerage transactions in a broad range of commercial property types, with a total sales volume of approximately $36.1 billion. In the last 10 years, we have closed more transactions than any other firm. We have significantly diversified our business beyond our historical focus on multifamily properties. 
 We are building on our track record of growth in multifamily, retail, office and industrial properties by expanding our coverage of additional property types. These include hospitality, self-storage, seniors housing, land and manufactured housing properties, where we are already a leading broker but have significant room for additional growth due to market size, fragmentation and specific geographic market opportunities. We are also expanding our specialty group management and support infrastructure, specialized branding and business development customized for each property type and intensifying our recruiting efforts, for management and investment sales and financing professionals. These efforts should expand our presence and result in increased business in these property types. 
 We service clients in all market segments by underwriting, marketing, selling and financing commercial real estate properties in a manner that maximizes value for sellers and provides buyers with the largest and most diverse inventory of commercial properties. In addition, we achieved growth by leveraging the strength of our relationships in the private client market segment to increase our share of the middle and larger transaction market segments. Because commission rates earned on commercial properties are typically inversely correlated with sales price, our expansion into the middle and larger transaction market segments, has led to our average commission rates fluctuating from period-to-period as a result of changes in the relative mix of transactions closed in the middle and larger transaction market segments as compared to the private client market segment. 
 The following table sets forth the number of transactions, sales volume and revenue by commercial real estate market segment for real estate brokerage in 2018 compared to 2017: 
 

Real Estate Brokerage: | | 2018 | | | 2017 | | | Change 
 | Number | | | Volume | | | Revenues | | Number | | Volume | | | Revenues | | | Number | Volume | | Revenues |

Financing 
 Marcus & Millichap Capital Corporation (MMCC) is a broker of debt financing for commercial properties principally in the under $10 million market segments. We generate revenue in the form of financing fees collected from the placement of loans with banks, insurance companies, government agencies, commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) and conduits. In addition to placing financing for acquisitions, we also place loans for refinancing for individual assets and portfolios. MMCCs financing fees vary by loan amount and type. In 2018, MMCC completed 1,678 financing transactions with a sales volume of approximately $6.2 billion, which accounted for approximately 7% of our revenues. MMCCs size, market reach and sales volume enable us to establish long-term relationships and special programs with various capital sources. This, in turn, improves MMCCs value proposition to borrowers seeking competitive financing rates and terms. MMCC is not limited to promoting in-house or exclusive capital sources and seeks the most competitive financing solution for each clients specific needs and circumstances. During 2018, approximately 46% of MMCCs revenues came from placing acquisition financing, 44% from refinancing activities and 10% from other financing activities. 
 MMCC is fully integrated with our investment sales force in our brokerage offices. MMCC financing professionals are supervised by our regional managers, who promote cross-selling, information sharing, business

  referrals and high-quality client service within the offices. The MMCC national network of financing professionals is supported by a dedicated, nationally focused management team coordinating access to a broad range of national and regional capital sources including bank lenders, conduit lenders, CMBS lenders, structured debt facilitators (mezzanine and preferred equity), Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae programs, HUD and other GSE lending programs. With these resources coupled with the latest property and capital markets information, we are able to access and deliver loan structures, financing rates and terms to meet our clients financial objectives. 
 Ancillary Services: Research, Advisory and Consulting 
 Our research, advisory and consulting services are designed to assist clients in forming their investment strategy and making transaction decisions. Our advisory and consulting services are coordinated with both our investment sales and financing professionals and are designed to provide market and property focused market research, publications and customized analysis that increase customer loyalty and long-term relationships. 
 We also provide a wide range of advisory and consulting services to developers, lenders, owners, real estate investment trusts, high net worth individuals, pension fund advisors and other institutions. Our advisory services include opinions of value, operating and financial performance benchmarking analysis, specific asset buy-sell strategies, market and submarket analysis and ranking, portfolio strategies by property type, market strategy, development and redevelopment feasibility studies and other services. 
Corporate Information 
 We were formed as a sole proprietorship in 1971, incorporated in California on August 26, 1976 as G. M. Marcus & Company, and we were renamed as Marcus & Millichap, Inc. in August 1978, Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Investment Brokerage Company in September 1985, and Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Investment Services, Inc., or MMREIS, in February 2007. Prior to the completion of our initial public offering (IPO), MMREIS was majority-owned by Marcus & Millichap Company (MMC) and all of MMREIS preferred and common stock outstanding was held by MMC and its affiliates or officers and employees of MMREIS. In June 2013, in preparation for the spin-off of its real estate investment services business (the Spin-Off), MMC formed a holding company called Marcus & Millichap, Inc., or MMI, in Delaware. Prior to the completion of our IPO, the shareholders of MMREIS contributed the shares of MMREIS to MMI in exchange for common stock of MMI, and MMREIS became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MMI. On November 5, 2013, MMI completed its IPO. 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 23975 Park Sorrento, Suite 400 Calabasas, California 91302. Our telephone number at this location is (818) 212-2250. Our website address is www.MarcusMillichap.com. The information on our website is not part of, and is not incorporated into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competitive Strengths 
 We believe the following strengths provide us with a competitive advantage and opportunities for success: 
 National Platform Built on Investment Brokerage and Financing Services 
 We have built a leading national platform serving our clients needs of investment brokerage and financing services. We continue to be focused on investment brokerage and financing services as opposed to other businesses such as leasing or property management. Our commitment to specialization is reflected in how we generally organize our investment sales and financing professionals by market area and property type, which enhances our investment sales and financing professionals skills, relationships and market knowledge required for achieving the best results for our clients. As a result of these founding principles, we offer an efficient system of matching every property with the largest pool of qualified buyers and therefore maximizing value in the process.

 Market Leader in the Private Client Market Segment 
 Since our founding in 1971, we have focused on being the leading service provider to the $1-$10 million private client market segment. This segment is the largest by ownership and transaction count and consistently accounts for over 80% of total U.S. commercial property transactions and over 60% of the commission pool. It is comprised of high-net-worth individuals, partnerships and small private fund managers with both passive, long-term investments, as well as those with opportunistic and short-term investment horizons. Private clients are often motivated to buy, sell and/or refinance properties not only for business reasons but also due to personal circumstances, such as death, divorce, changes in partnership structures and other personal or financial circumstances. The vast size and personal transaction drivers of private clients make this market segment the most active in terms of sales velocity. Therefore, sales in the private client market segment over the long term tend to be less volatile than higher priced properties priced at $10 million and above. In addition, this market segment is highly fragmented with the top 10 brokerage firms accounting for approximately 24% of transactions in 2018. Marcus & Millichap is the leading broker in the $1-$10 million private client market segment with an 8.3% market share by transaction count. With our established market leadership and brand name, Marcus & Millichap has significant room for market share expansion by further consolidating its leadership position in this market segment. 
 In addition, the private client market segment is characterized by high barriers to entry. These barriers include the need for a large specialized sales force prospecting private clients, difficulties in identifying, establishing and maintaining relationships with such investors, capabilities of exposing properties to a large pool of potential buyers and the challenge of serving their needs locally, regionally and nationally. We believe this private client market segment is the least covered market segment by other national firms and is significantly underserved by local and regional firms that lack a national platform. 
 Platform Built for Maximizing Investor Value 
 We have built our business to maximize value for real estate investors through an integrated set of services geared toward our clients needs. We are committed to an investment brokerage specialization, provide one of the largest sales force in the industry, promote a culture and policy of information sharing on each property we represent, and equip our investment sales professionals with proprietary real estate inventory and marketing technologies that enhance the marketability of the properties we represent. Our system generates real-time buyer-seller matching and maximizes value one property at a time. Our investment sales organization can therefore underwrite, position and market investment real estate to the largest pool of qualified buyers. We coordinate proactive marketing campaigns across investor relationships and resources of the entire firm, far beyond the capabilities of an individual listing agent. These efforts produce wide exposure to investors whom we identify as high-probability bidders for each property. To grow with our clients, we established the IPA group to serve the needs of our private client investors that are now seeking higher valued properties as well as larger institutional investors. Our ability to bridge private capital with larger, institutional assets creates value for private and larger transaction clients while offering growth opportunities and strengthening the retention of our investment sales and financing professionals. 
 We have one of the largest teams of financing professionals in the investment brokerage industry through MMCC. MMCC provides financing expertise and access to debt and capital sources by identifying and securing competitive loan pricing and terms for our clients across a broad range of potential lenders and financing alternatives. We are a leading mortgage broker in the industry based on the number of financing transactions closed in 2017. Finally, our dedicated market research teams analyze the latest local and national economic and real estate trends and produce proprietary analyses for our clients enabling them to make informed investment and financing decisions. Integrating all these services into one national platform increases opportunities to maximize value for our clients across multiple property types, market segments and geographies.

 Local Management with Significant Investment Brokerage Experience 
 Our management team members, as executives of the firm, are dedicated to recruiting, training, developing and supporting our investment sales and financing professionals. The majority of our management team are former senior investment sales professionals of our Company who now focus on management, do not compete with our sales force and have an average of approximately 11 years of real estate investment brokerage experience with our Company. Our training, development and mentoring programs rely greatly on the regional managers personal involvement. Their past experience as senior investment sales professionals plays a key role in developing new and experienced investment sales and financing professionals. They help our junior professionals establish technical and client service skills as well as setting up, developing and growing relationships with clients. We believe this management structure has helped differentiate the firm from our competitors and ultimately achieves better results for our clients. 
Growth Strategy 
 The real estate market is cyclical, and our results are impacted by many macroeconomic and microeconomic factors as discussed in Item 1ARisk Factors and Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFactors Affecting Our Business. We have demonstrated the ability, over the long-term, to manage through the cyclical market and continue to be a leader in the $1-10 million private client market segment. The following graph shows the number of transactions and sales volume of investment sales, financing and other transactions from 2009 to 2018: 
 


10 


 We have a long track record of growing our business model driven by opening new offices, recruiting, training and developing new investment sales and financing professionals as well as deploying our client-focused business model to increase coverage of specialty property types and the middle and larger transaction market segments. Our long-term growth plan has focused on investing in our current business model through growing internally and by providing our unique business model to a wider client base. Since 2010, our revenue has increased threefold, and we have grown from slightly over 1,000 investment sales and financing professionals to nearly 2,000 investment sales and financing professionals in the United States and Canada. Our future growth will depend on continually expanding our national footprint and optimizing the size, product segmentation and specialization of our team of investment sales and financing professionals. The key strategies of our growth plan include: 
 Increase Market Share in the Private Client Market Segment 
 The $1-$10 million private client market segment is fragmented and underserved. The top 10 brokerage firms accounted for only approximately 24% of 2018 transactions in this market segment. Our leading position in this market segment and inherent fragmentation continues to provide significant opportunity for us to expand and bring our client service offerings to a larger portion of this expansive market segment. We can continue to leverage our existing platform, relationships and brand recognition among private clients to grow through expanded marketing and coverage. 
Focused Office Expansion 
 Since we currently have offices in most major-market and mid-market metropolitan cities, our growth is expected to come from focused office expansion, targeted hiring and increased coverage of specialty property types. We have targeted markets based on population, employment, level of commercial real estate sales, inventory and competitive landscape. Our optimal office plans are used to capitalize on these factors by tailoring sales force size, coverage and composition by office and business activity to direct efforts to offices with the most opportunity where we believe we can leverage our national footprint and proprietary real estate marketing technologies. These initiatives do not require a significant increase in the number of offices or a significant increase in the size of our offices, which allows us to leverage our current office locations without significant incremental investment. 
Expand and Develop Our Team of Investment Sales Professionals 
 A key to growing our business is hiring, training and developing investment sales professionals. We have increased our focus on hiring experienced investment sales professionals through our recruiting department, specialty directors and regional managers in support of our optimal office plans. Our new investment sales professionals are trained in all aspects of real estate fundamentals, client service and proprietary marketing technologies through formal training, apprenticeship programs and mentorship by our dedicated regional, district and division managers. As these investment sales professionals mature, we continue to provide them with identified best practices and training in specialty property types. We believe this model creates a high level of teamwork, as well as operational and client service consistency. During 2018, we reached an all-time high in the number of investment sales professionals, ending the year with 1,866. 
Pursue Selective Acquisitions 
 Acquisitions have become a strategy to supplement the growth of our salesforce. We continually explore acquisition opportunities to augment our brokerage and financing businesses. We primarily look for acquisitions of small-to-medium size brokerage and financing businesses or teams of professionals with consistent revenue and earnings trends, which will expand our geographic and property type coverage. 
 
11 


 Grow in Specialty Property Types and Middle and Larger Transaction Market Segment Presence 
 Leveraging our current business model into specialty property types and to the middle and larger transaction market segments opens up significant opportunities for growth. 
 Specialty Property Types 
 We believe that specialty property types, including hospitality, self-storage, seniors housing, land and manufactured housing offer significant opportunities for our clients. By deploying our unique business model to increase coverage of these property types, we can create growth for us as well as enhance value for our clients through diversification. To create these opportunities, we are increasing our property type expertise by continuing to strategically add specialty directors who can bring added management capacity, business development and investment sales professional support. These executives will work with our sales management team to increase investment sales professional hiring, training, development and redeployment and to execute various branding and marketing campaigns to expand our presence in these targeted property types. The number and volume of transactions in the primary property types of multifamily, retail, office and industrial should continue to grow with upside opportunity, particularly in the office and industrial properties. At the same time, we intend to continue to grow our presence in specialty property types. 
Middle and Larger Transaction Market Segments Presence 
 Our extensive relationships with private client investors who typically invest in the $1-$10 million private client market segment have enabled us to capture a greater portion of commercial real estate transactions in excess of $10 million and bridge the private client market investor to the middle market and larger transaction market segments in recent years. As property values increase and investors grow and expand, they require larger properties. We are organized to provide our unique brokerage and financing services to them in those market segments. Our ability to connect private client capital with middle and larger transaction market segment properties allows us to continue to serve our clients as they grow and plays a major role in differentiating our services. In 2011, we introduced a group dedicated to serving major investors, branded as IPA, specifically to service larger multifamily investors. This strategy has met with great success and market acceptance and provides a vehicle for growth by delivering our unique service platform within the middle and larger transaction multifamily, retail and office property types. The growth of our investors and introduction of IPA has driven incremental growth for us. 
Expand Marcus & Millichap Capital Corporation Financing Business 
 Our focus on growth for MMCC continues to be expanding our financing services in markets currently served by our investment brokerage offices, increasing the capacity of financing professionals in offices we currently serve, integrating financing professionals and related services in offices that do not have an MMCC presence and expanding our service platform by increasing access to a broad array of capital resources. We have established alliances with national capital sources that provide highly competitive access to an assortment of financing products including products sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and HUD. These alliances serve to expand our partners distribution networks while affording our financing professionals and clients with more favorable pricing and service. Our internally developed training programs are directed to enhancing our branding, skill development, increasing our internal capture rate and cross-selling with a focus on the MMCC value proposition for our brokerage and non-brokerage clients. We will continue to seek out and hire experienced financing professionals and capital markets teams to grow our MMCC business to support the growth in our service platform and establish relationships with various capital sources. As of December 31, 2018, we have 42 offices with financing professionals embedded within our brokerage teams. We continue to capitalize on the synergies our financing professionals provide to our client focused service platform with approximately 16.4% year-over-year growth in financing fees ($57.8 million in financing fees in 2018 from $49.7 million in 2017). 
 
12 


 Seasonality 
 There is seasonality in our real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees, which has generally caused our revenues, operating income, net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. For a more detailed description of our seasonality, refer to Item 1A  Risk Factors  External Business Risks  Seasonal fluctuations and other market data in the investment real estate industry could adversely affect our business and make comparisons of our quarterly results difficult and Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview  Seasonality of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition 
 We compete in real estate brokerage and financing within the commercial real estate industry on a national, regional and local basis. Competition is based on a number of critical factors, including the quality and expertise of our investment sales and financing professionals, our execution skills, sales support, brand recognition and our business reputation. We primarily compete with other brokerage and financing firms that seek investment brokerage and financing business from real estate owners and investors. To a lesser extent, we compete with in-house real estate departments, owners who may transact without using a brokerage firm, direct lenders, consulting firms and investment managers. Our relative competitive position also varies across geographies, property types and services. In investment sales, our competitors on a national level include CBRE Group, Inc., Cushman & Wakefield, Colliers International, HFF, Inc., Newmark Knight Frank, NAI Global and Jones Lang LaSalle. Our major financing competitors include HFF, Inc., CBRE Group, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle, Walker & Dunlop and NorthMarq Capital, LLC. These investment sales firms mainly focus on larger sales and institutional investors and are not heavily concentrated in our largest market segment, which is the $1-$10 million private client market segment. However, there is crossover and competition between us and these firms. As a result of the fragmentation in the market, there are also numerous local and regional competitors in our markets, as well as competitors specializing in certain property types. Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive. 
 Competition to attract and retain qualified professionals is also intense in each of our geographic regions and across all property types. We offer what we believe to be competitive compensation and support programs to our professionals. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend on retaining, motivating and appropriately compensating our professionals. 
 Technology 
 We have a long-standing tradition of technological orientation, innovation and advancement. Our efforts include the development of proprietary applications designed to make the process of matching buyer and sellers faster and more efficient as well as state-of-the-art communication technology, infrastructure, internet presence and electronic marketing. 
 We have a proprietary internal marketing system, MNet, which allows our sales force to share listing information with investors across the country. MNet is an integrated tool that contains our entire national property inventory, which allows our sales force to search for properties based on investors acquisition criteria. This system is an essential part of connecting buyers and sellers through our national platform. Our policies require information sharing among our sales force, and the MNet system automates the process of matching each property we represent to the largest pool of qualified buyers tracked by our national sales force. A part of MNet, called Buyer Needs, enables our sales force to register the investment needs of various buyers, which are then matched to our available inventory on a real-time basis. 
 In 2018, we relaunched MNet with significant new capabilities, which allow our sales force to find listings with more targeted criteria, such as searching by demographic data surrounding a target property. The new version of MNet significantly reduces the time required to find properties that meet a clients needs. 
 
13 


 A related application, MNet-Offering, is a system for automating the production of property marketing materials and launching marketing campaigns. MNet-Offering allows our investment sales professionals to create a listing proposal or marketing package, which automatically imports property information, data on comparable properties and other information, and then dynamically populates our e-marketing, print and Internet media. This system allows our sales force to rapidly create professionally branded and designed materials for marketing properties on behalf of our clients in an efficient and timely manner. This web-based application improves sales force efficiency by tightly integrating MNet data for transaction history, sales and rent comparables, and market insights that differentiate our sales force in the marketplace. The proposals and marketing packages produced by MNet-Offering also deliver updated content and expanded demographic and financial analysis to better market those properties for our clients. 
 Our website is designed not only to bring in new clients for our investment sales and financing professionals, but also to make our inventory of properties available for maximum exposure for our sellers, and to provide buyers an opportunity to engage with our investment sales and financing professionals. We actively qualify leads generated from the contact forms and pass those leads to our agents via our customer relationship management platform. Our websites average approximately 71,000 new visitors per month and 856,000 page views per month (all based on data from Google Analytics) and also serve as a portal for delivery of online marketing materials and for deal collaboration. 
 Marketing and Branding 
 We are known for our 48 years of providing investment brokerage and financing services through a proprietary marketing system, policies and culture of information sharing and in-depth investment brokerage training, all of which is executed under the supervision of a dedicated local, regional and national management team focused on client service and growing the firm. 
 In recent years we have also garnered recognition among larger private investors and institutions due to our integrated platform and capability of linking private and institutional capital. We continue to strengthen and broaden the Companys name recognition and credibility by executing a variety of marketing and branding strategies.

  and video. Nationally, our specialty groups and capital markets executives actively participate in various trade organizations, many of which focus on specific property types and provide an effective vehicle for client relationship development and branding. 
 We believe all these activities create significant exposure and name recognition for our firm, which fosters and builds strong, long-term client relationships. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We hold various trademarks and trade names, which include the Marcus & Millichap name. Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially, adversely affected by the expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the Marcus & Millichap name. With respect to the Marcus & Millichap name, we maintain trademark registrations for these service marks. 
 In addition to trade names, we have developed proprietary technologies for the provision of real estate investment services, such as MNet and MNet-Offering. We also offer proprietary research to clients through our research division. While we seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business, we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business in the aggregate. 
 Government Regulation 
 We are subject to various real estate regulations, and we maintain real estate and other broker licenses in 45 states in the United States and four provinces in Canada. We are a licensed broker in each state in which we have an office, as well as those states where we frequently do business. We are also subject to numerous other federal, state and local laws and regulations that contain general standards for, and prohibitions on, the conduct of real estate brokers and sales associates, including agency duties, collection of commissions, telemarketing, advertising and consumer disclosures. 
Employees and Investment Sales and Financing Professionals 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,977 investment sales and financing professionals of which 1,873 are exclusive independent contractors and the remainder are our employees. Most of our investment sales professionals are classified as independent contractors under state and IRS guidelines. As such, we generally do not pay for the professionals expenses or benefits or withhold payroll taxes; rather they are paid from the commissions earned by us upon the closing of a transaction, and these individuals do not earn a salary from which taxes are withheld. Our investment sales and financing professionals hold applicable real estate sales licenses for their function and execute a Salespersons Agreement setting out the relationship between the professional and us. Each professional is obligated to provide brokerage services exclusively to us, and is provided access to our information technology, research and other support and business forms. Each professional generally reports on their activities to either the local regional manager, or in some cases, to product specialty managers. 
 We had 831 employees as of December 31, 2018, consisting of 104 employees as financing professionals, 25 employees in communications and marketing, 18 employees in research and 684 employees in management, support and general and administrative functions. We believe our employee relations are good.
