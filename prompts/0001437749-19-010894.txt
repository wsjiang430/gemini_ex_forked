Internet
 
We seek to combine our product selection and pet health information with the shopping ease of the Internet to deliver a convenient and personalized shopping experience. Our website offers health and nutritional product selections for dogs and cats, and relevant editorial and easily obtainable or retrievable resource information. Customers can search our website for products and access resources on a variety of information on dogs and cats. Customers can shop at our website by category, product line, individual product, or symptom. We attracted approximately 30 million visitors to our website during fiscal 2019, approximately 10% of those visitors placed an order, and our website generated approximately 85% of our total sales for the same time period. On our website pet owners have access to health information covering pets’ behavior and illnesses, and natural and pharmaceutical remedies specifically for a pet’s problem. The pet education content on our main website is periodically updated with the latest research for pet owners. As part of our multichannel strategy, we also offer mobile versions of our website (www.1800petmeds.com) and an application for mobile phones, tablets, and other devices. In February 2017, we released our mobile application, which offers customers a more streamlined shopping experience. Mobile application features include: “ask-the-vet”; live web chat; easy refill medication reminders; local veterinarian finder; and express checkout to provide our customers with fast, easy, and helpful service from their mobile devices.
Telephone Contact Center
 
Our customer care representatives receive and process inbound and outbound customer calls, facilitate our live web chat, and process customer e-mails. Our telephone system is equipped with certain features including pop-up screens and call blending capabilities that give us the ability to efficiently utilize our customer care representatives’ time, providing excellent customer care, service, and support. Our customer care representatives receive a base salary and are rewarded with commissions for sales, and bonuses and other awards for achieving certain quality goals.
 
Direct Mail/Print
 
We mail brochures and postcards in response to requests generated from our advertising and as part of direct mail campaigns to our customers.
 
Our Customers
 
Approximately 2.3 million customers have purchased from us within the last two years. We attracted approximately 467,000 and 521,000 new customers in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our customers are located throughout the United States, with approximately 50% of customers residing in California, Florida, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia.

Marketing
 
The goal of our marketing strategy is to build brand recognition, increase customer traffic, add new customers, build strong customer loyalty, maximize reorders, and develop incremental revenue opportunities. We have an integrated marketing campaign that includes online marketing, television advertising, and direct mail/print and e-mail.

Television Advertising
 
Our television advertising is designed to build brand equity, create brand awareness, and generate initial purchases of products via the telephone and the Internet. Our television commercials typically focus on our ability to rapidly deliver to customers the same medications offered by veterinarians, but at reduced prices. We generally purchase advertising on national cable channels to target our key demographic group – women, ages 30 to 65. We believe that television advertising is particularly effective and instrumental in building brand awareness. Our most current television commercial, airing nationally, speaks to pet owners about the savings and convenience of purchasing the same exact pet medications from 1-800-PetMeds.
 
Direct Mail/Print and E-mail
 
We use direct mail/print and e-mail to acquire new customers and to remind our existing customers to reorder.
 
Operations
 
Order Processing
 
Our website allows customers to easily browse and purchase all of our products online. Our website is designed to be fast, secure, and easy to use with order and shipping confirmations, and with online order tracking capabilities. We provide our customers with toll-free telephone access to our customer care representatives. Our call center generally operates from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM, Monday through Thursday, 7:00 AM to 9:00 PM on Friday, 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Saturday, and 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Sunday, Eastern Time. The process of customers purchasing products from 1-800-PetMeds consists of a few simple steps. A customer first places an order online or by calling our toll-free telephone number. The following information is needed to process prescription orders: pet information, prescription information, and the veterinarian’s name and phone number. This information is entered into our computer system. Then our pharmacists and pharmacy technicians verify all prescriptions. The order process system checks for the verification for prescription medication orders and a valid payment method for all orders. Verified orders are then sent to our fulfillment center, where items are picked, and then shipped via United States Postal Service and Federal Express. Our customers enjoy the convenience of rapid home delivery, with the majority of all orders being shipped within 24 hours of ordering.
Customer Care and Support
 
We believe that a high level of customer care and support is critical in retaining and expanding our customer base. Customer care representatives participate in ongoing training programs under the supervision of our training managers. These training sessions include a variety of topics such as product knowledge, computer usage, customer service tips, and the relationship between our Company and veterinarians. Our customer care representatives respond to customers’ e-mails, calls, and live web chats that are related to products, order status, prices, and shipping. We believe our customer care representatives are a valuable source of feedback regarding customer satisfaction.
Warehousing and Shipping
 
We inventory our products and fill most customer orders from our corporate headquarters in Delray Beach, Florida. We have an in-house fulfillment and distribution operation, which is used to manage the entire supply chain, beginning with the placement of the order, continuing through order processing, and then fulfilling and shipping of the product to the customer. We offer a variety of shipping options, including next day delivery. We ship to anywhere in the United States served by the United States Postal Service or Federal Express. Priority orders are expedited in our fulfillment process. Our goal is to ship the products the same day that the order is received. For prescription medications, our goal is to ship the product immediately after the prescription has been authorized by the customer’s veterinarian.

Purchasing
 
We purchase our products from a variety of sources, including certain manufacturers, domestic distributors, and wholesalers. There were four suppliers from whom we purchased approximately 50% of all products in fiscal 2019. We believe having strong relationships with product manufacturers and distributors will ensure the availability of an adequate volume of products ordered by our customers. Some of the major manufacturers of prescription and non-prescription medications have declined to sell these products to direct marketing companies, such as our company. (See Risk Factors.) Part of our growth strategy includes developing direct relationships with all of the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers of the more popular prescription and non-prescription medications.
Technology
 
We utilize integrated technologies in our call centers, e-commerce, order entry, and inventory control/fulfillment operations. Our systems are custom configured by us to optimize our computer telephone integration and mail-order processing. The systems are designed to maintain a large database of specialized information and process a large volume of orders efficiently and effectively. Our systems provide our customer care representatives, and our customers on our website, including on our mobile application, with real time product availability information and updated customer information to enhance our customer care.
 
We also have an integrated direct connection for processing credit cards to ensure that a valid credit card number and authorization have been received at the same time our customer care representatives are on the telephone with the customer or when a customer submits an order on our website. Our information systems provide our customer care representatives with records of all prior contact with a customer, including the customer’s address, telephone number, e-mail address, prescription information, order history, payment history, and notes.
 
Competition
 
The pet medications market is competitive and highly fragmented. Our competitors consist of veterinarians, and online and traditional retailers. We believe that the following are the principal competitive factors in our market:

● | Product selection and availability, including the availability of prescription and non-prescription medications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Brand recognition;
--+-------------------


● | Reliability and speed of delivery;
--+-----------------------------------


● | Personalized service and convenience;
--+--------------------------------------


● | Price; and
--+-----------


● | Website usability and content.
--+-------------------------------

 
We compete with veterinarians, and online and traditional retailers for the sale of prescription and non-prescription pet medications and other health products. Many pet owners may prefer the convenience of purchasing their pet medications or other health products at the time of a veterinarian visit. In order to effectively compete with veterinarians, we must continue to educate pet owners about the service, convenience, and savings offered by our Company.
 
According to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association, pet spending in the United States increased 4.4% to $72.6 billion in 2018. Pet supplies and medications represented $18.1 billion, or 25% of the total spending on pets in the United States. The pet medication market that we participate in is estimated to be approximately $5.0 billion, with veterinarians having the majority of the market share. The dog and cat population is approximately 184 million, with approximately 68% of all households having a pet.
 
We believe that the following are the main competitive strengths that differentiate 1-800-PetMeds from the competition:
 

● | Channel leader, in an estimated $5.0 billion industry;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | “1-800-PetMeds” brand name;
--+----------------------------


● | Licensed pharmacy to conduct business in 50 states, and a Pharmacy Verified website (a website verification program by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy®, which identifies online pharmacies and pharmacy-related websites as safe and legitimate);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exceptional customer care and support.

To the extent that we are unable to maintain our license as a community pharmacy with the Florida Board of Pharmacy, or if we do not maintain the licenses granted by other state pharmacy boards, or if we become subject to actions by the FDA, or other enforcement regulators, our distribution of prescription medications to pet owners could cease, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
