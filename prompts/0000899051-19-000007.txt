Item 1.  Business
The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992 to serve as the holding company for Allstate Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company and other subsidiaries (collectively, including The Allstate Corporation, “Allstate”). 
Allstate’s purpose is to protect people from life’s uncertainties and prepare them for the future so they can realize their hopes and dreams. Allstate is primarily engaged in the property and casualty insurance business in the United States and Canada. Additionally, Allstate provides customers other protection offerings such as life, accident and health insurance and protection plans that cover electronic devices and personal identities. 
The Allstate Corporation is one of the largest publicly held personal lines insurers in the United States. Allstate’s Property-Liability strategy is to serve distinct customer segments with differentiated offerings. The Allstate brand is widely known through the “You’re In Good Hands With Allstate®” slogan. Allstate is the 3rd largest personal property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of 2017 statutory direct premiums written according to A.M. Best. 


In addition, Allstate also has strong market positions in other protection products. According to A.M. Best, Allstate is the nation’s 20th largest issuer of life insurance business on the basis of 2017 ordinary life insurance in force and 38th largest on the basis of 2017 statutory admitted assets. Allstate Benefits provides accident, health and life insurance through employers and is one of the top five voluntary benefits carriers in the market based on a 2017 voluntary/worksite industry survey. SquareTrade provides protection plans on a wide variety of consumer goods such as cell phones, tablets, computers and appliances, and has a leading position in distribution through major retailers. InfoArmor provides identity protection through employers and has a leading position in this distribution channel. In total, Allstate had 113.9 million policies in force (“PIF”) as of December 31, 2018.
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we occasionally refer to statutory financial information. All domestic United States insurance companies are required to prepare statutory-basis financial statements. As a result, industry data is available that enables comparisons between insurance companies, including competitors that are not required to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We frequently use industry publications containing statutory financial information to assess our competitive position.

Allstate Protection Segment

Strategy 
We serve all four consumer segments using differentiated products, analytical expertise, telematics and an integrated digital enterprise that leverages data and technology to redesign our processes with a focus on greater effectiveness and efficiencies and long-term expense savings.
Allstate brand strategy 
Our strategy is to grow profitably through exclusive agencies, who serve as trusted advisors to customers, while leveraging best-in-class operational capabilities to gain market share and efficiencies. The Allstate brand differentiates itself by offering comprehensive product options and features through agencies that provide local advice and service, including a partnership with exclusive financial specialists to deliver life and retirement solutions.

Available Allstate’s 10,700 exclusive agencies provide customized solutions and support based on our consumers’ needs. Agencies are established in 10,600 locations, supported by 26,900 licensed sales professionals and 1,100 exclusive financial specialists who are trusted advisors to our customers. 

Being a trusted advisor means that our agencies 
• Have a local presence in our customers’ communities 
• Know customers and understand the unique needs of their households 
• Help customers assess the potential risks they face 
• Provide local expertise and personalized guidance on how to protect what matters most to customers by offering customized solutions 
• Support customers when they have changes in their lives and during their times of need 

Allstate exclusive agencies also offer life and retirement solutions and can partner with exclusive financial specialists who provide expertise with more complex life and retirement solutions and other financial needs of our customers. 
Exclusive agencies and financial specialists are supported through marketing assistance, service and business processes, technology, education, offering financing to grow their businesses and other resources to help them enhance the customer experience and to acquire and retain more customers. We continue to focus on the effectiveness and efficiency of our distribution system and the breadth of our product offerings.
Competitive Data, analytics and technology support advancements in pricing sophistication for all lines of business. Pricing and underwriting strategies and decisions are designed to generate sustainable profitable growth.
Targeted marketing includes messaging that communicates the value of our Good Hands®, the importance of having proper coverage, product options, and the ease of doing business with Allstate and our exclusive agencies.
Enhanced loss cost management and expense control are a priority. To achieve this, we are continuing to modernize our operating platform (including enhanced digital capabilities) and optimizing vendor relationships. Investments are being made to increase efficiencies and reduce expenses.
Simple We are focused on creating value through simplicity, quality, rewarding engagement and improving ease of access and service through an integrated digital enterprise. 
Emerging technologies and predictive analytics are being used to simplify the customer experience and expedite the claims process. To achieve this, we have opened several Digital Operating Centers to handle auto physical damage claims countrywide. The centers utilize virtual estimation capabilities, which include estimating damage through photos and video with the use of QuickFoto Claim® and Virtual Assist® (video chat technology used to review supplemental damage with auto body shops). We are also leveraging virtual 


capabilities to handle property claims by estimating damage through video with Virtual Assist and aerial imagery using satellites, airplanes and drones. 
Connected We will continue to leverage telematics to offer customers a highly individualized price, better understand their risks and improve customer experience delivered through innovative products and services. 
Current capabilities are being expanded through our partnership with Arity, which uses telematics to offer personalized, engaging programs that empower drivers with insights about their vehicle’s health, costs and safety. 
Exclusive agency compensation structure The compensation structure for Allstate exclusive agencies rewards agencies for delivering high value to customers and achieving certain business outcomes such as product profitability, growth and household penetration. Allstate exclusive agency remuneration comprises a base commission, variable compensation and a bonus. 

• | Agencies receive a monthly base commission payment as a percentage of their total eligible written premium.


• | Variable compensation rewards agencies for meeting customers’ needs for life insurance and retirement policies sold relative to the size of the agency.


• | Bonus compensation is based on a percentage of premiums and can be earned by agencies who are meeting certain sales goals and selling additional policies to meet customer needs profitably.

Agencies have the ability to earn commissions and additional bonuses on non-proprietary products provided to customers when an Allstate product is not available. In 2018, Ivantage had $1.8 billion non-proprietary premiums under management and is a leading provider of property and casualty brokerage services. 
Allstate exclusive financial specialists receive commissions for proprietary and non-proprietary sales and earn a bonus based on the volume of business produced with Allstate exclusive agencies.  
Allstate independent agent remuneration comprises a base commission and a bonus that can be earned by agents who achieve sales goals and a target loss ratio. 
Commercial lines strategy  We are actively pursuing profitable expansion of our commercial lines, including the shared economy, such as transportation network companies. Profit improvement actions have been implemented for our traditional commercial lines insurance products, emphasizing pricing, claims, governance and operational improvements.
Esurance strategy 
We are working to make insurance surprisingly painless by innovating to make it simple, transparent, and affordable.  We plan to grow profitably by

delivering an excellent customer experience at an exceptional value through an engaged and high-performing workforce. To provide an enhanced customer experience we:

• | Offer a seamless online and mobile experience with fast quoting for ease and convenience.


• | Provide hassle-free purchases and claims processing through intuitive tools and advanced technology.


• | Offer a broad suite of protection products and solutions to our customers.


• | Offer innovative product options and features.

Encompass strategy 
Our strategy is to expand the independent agency footprint, broaden geographic and product diversification, enhance pricing and underwriting sophistication and provide a superior customer and agent experience.  
Over the past several years, Encompass has been executing on a profit improvement plan emphasizing pricing, governance and operational improvements at both the state and countrywide levels.  These actions have improved underlying profitability but led to a reduction of policies in force compared to prior years for both auto and homeowners.  
Answer Financial strategy
Answer Financial is an insurance agency that sells other insurance companies’ products directly to customers online. Our strategy as a technology-enabled insurance agency is to provide comparison shopping and related services for businesses, offering customers choice, convenience and ease of use.
Allstate Protection pricing and risk management strategies 
Our pricing and underwriting strategies and decisions are designed to generate sustainable profitable growth. 
A proprietary database of underwriting and loss experience enables sophisticated pricing algorithms and methodologies to more accurately price risks while also seeking to attract and retain customers in multiple risk segments. 

• | For auto insurance, risk evaluation factors can include, but are not limited to, vehicle make, model and year; driver age and marital status; territory; years licensed; loss history; years insured with prior carrier; prior liability limits; prior lapse in coverage; and insurance scoring utilizing telematics data and other consumer information.


• | For property insurance, risk evaluation factors can include, but are not limited to, the amount of insurance purchased; geographic location of the property; loss history; age, condition and construction characteristics of the property; and


characteristics of the insured including insurance scoring utilizing other consumer information.
A combination of underwriting information, pricing and discounts are also used to achieve a more competitive position and growth. The pricing strategy involves local marketplace pricing and underwriting decisions based on risk evaluation factors and an evaluation of competitors to the extent permissible by applicable law.
Pricing of property products is intended to establish risk-adjusted returns that are acceptable over a long-term period. Rate increases are pursued to keep pace with loss trends, including losses from catastrophic events and those that are weather-related (such as wind, hail, lightning and freeze not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe). We also take into consideration potential customer disruption, the impact on our ability to market our products, regulatory limitations, our competitive position and profitability. 
In any reporting period, loss experience from catastrophic events and weather-related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations incorporated into product pricing. 
Property catastrophe exposure is managed with the goal of providing shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in the property business and to reduce the variability of earnings. Our property business includes personal homeowners, commercial property and other property insurance lines. Our current catastrophe reinsurance program supports our risk tolerance framework that targets less than a 1% likelihood of annual aggregate catastrophe losses from hurricanes and earthquakes, net of reinsurance, exceeding $2 billion. The use of different assumptions and updates to industry models, and updates to our risk transfer program could materially change the projected loss. Growth strategies include areas where we believe diversification can be enhanced and an appropriate return can be earned for the risk. As a result, our modeled exposure may increase, but in aggregate remain lower than $2 billion as noted above. In addition, we have exposure to other severe weather events and wildfires, which impact catastrophe losses.
Property catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, fires following earthquakes and other catastrophes. We are also working to promote measures to prevent and mitigate losses and make homes and communities more resilient, including enactment of stronger building codes and effective enforcement of those codes, adoption of sensible land use policies, and development of effective and affordable methods of improving the resilience of existing structures.

Allstate Benefits Segment
Strategy 
Our Allstate Benefits segment accounted for 3.0% of Allstate’s 2018 consolidated total revenue and 3.7% of Allstate’s December 31, 2018 PIF. The Allstate Benefits segment provides consumers with financial protection against the risk of accidents, illness and mortality. We are an industry leader in the rapidly growing voluntary benefits market, offering a broad range of products through workplace enrollment. The voluntary market continues to grow as voluntary benefits products have become a core component of employer benefit offerings. Our life insurance portfolio includes individual and group term life and permanent life solutions.
Our products are offered through a network of independent agents and Allstate exclusive agencies. A broad product portfolio, flexible enrollment solutions and technology (including significant presence on employer benefit administration systems), our strong national accounts team, and a well-recognized brand differentiates Allstate Benefits.
Our strategy for growth is to become the industry leader in the voluntary benefits market by delivering substantially more value through innovative products and technology, tailored solutions and exceptional service. Initiatives are focused on expanding into non-traditional products and becoming an integrated digital enterprise through investments in future-state technologies and data and analytics capabilities.
Products and distribution

The market for voluntary benefits is growing as these products help employees fill the increasing gaps associated with continued medical cost inflation and the shifting of costs from employers to employees to cover co-pays and deductibles. Favorable industry and economic trends have increased competitive pressure and attracted new traditional and non-traditional entrants to the voluntary benefits market. Recent entrants, including large group medical, life and disability insurance carriers, are leveraging core benefit capabilities by bundling and discounting to capture voluntary market share. 
Geographic markets
We are authorized to sell voluntary benefits products in all 50 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and Canada. The top geographic markets are reflected below.

Allstate Annuities Segment
Strategy  
Our Allstate Annuities segment accounted for 2.4% of Allstate’s 2018 consolidated total revenue and 0.2% of Allstate’s December 31, 2018 PIF. The Allstate Annuities segment consists primarily of deferred fixed annuities and immediate fixed annuities (including standard and sub-standard structured settlements). The segment is in run-off and is focused on increasing lifetime economic value. Both the deferred and immediate annuity businesses have been adversely impacted by the historically low interest rate environment. Our immediate annuity business has also been impacted by medical advancements that have resulted in annuitants living longer than anticipated when many of these contracts were originated. 
Allstate Annuities focuses on the distinct risk and return profiles of the specific products when developing investment and liability management strategies. The level of legacy deferred annuities in force has been significantly reduced and the investment portfolio and crediting rates are proactively managed to improve profitability of the business while providing appropriate levels of liquidity. 
The investment portfolio supporting our immediate annuities is managed to ensure the assets match the characteristics of the liabilities and provide the long-term returns needed to support this business. To better match the long-term nature of our immediate annuities, we use performance-based investments in which we have ownership interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic asset or operating performance. 
We continue to review strategic options to reduce exposure and improve returns of the business. As a result, we may take additional operational and financial actions that offer return improvement and risk reduction opportunities.
Products and distribution
We previously offered and continue to have in force deferred fixed annuities and immediate fixed annuities (including standard and sub-standard structured settlements). We exited the continuing sale of annuities over an eight year period from 2006 to 2014, reflecting our expectations of declining returns. In 2006, we disposed of substantially all of the variable annuity business through reinsurance agreements. For discussion of non-proprietary retirement and investment products sold through our Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists, see Part I, Item 1. Allstate Life Segment of this report.


Other Business Segments
Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment
The Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from property and casualty insurance coverage that primarily relates to policies written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s. 
Strategy Management of this segment has been assigned to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy coverage interpretation, exposure identification, litigation and reinsurance collection. As part of its responsibilities, this group may at times be engaged in policy buybacks, settlements and reinsurance assumed and ceded commutations. 
Development in the reserves established for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines losses in the future may continue. Reserve changes can be caused by new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as arbitrations, litigation, legislative, judicial or regulatory actions. Environmental losses may also increase as the result of additional funding for environmental site clean-up. 
Challenges related to the concentration of insurance and reinsurance claims from companies who specialize in this business continue to be addressed. 
Corporate and Other Segment
Our Corporate and Other segment is comprised of holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations.

Regulation
Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent and substance of such regulation vary by state but generally have their source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that also delegate regulatory authority to a state agency. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters, including insurer solvency and statutory surplus sufficiency, reserve adequacy, insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster licensing, policy forms, rate setting, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, underwriting standards, statutory accounting methods, trade practices, privacy regulation and data security, corporate governance and risk management. In addition, state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation. For a discussion of statutory financial information, see Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. Notes 14 and 16 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.
As part of an effort to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) was enacted in 2010. Dodd-Frank created the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”). The FIO monitors the insurance industry, provides advice to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), represents the U.S. on international insurance matters, and studies the current regulatory system. 
Additional regulations or new requirements may emerge from the activities of various regulatory entities, including the Federal Reserve Board, FIO, FSOC, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”), that are evaluating solvency and capital standards for insurance company groups. In addition, the NAIC has adopted amendments to its model holding company law that have been adopted by some jurisdictions. The outcome of these actions is uncertain; however, these actions may result in an increase in the level of capital and liquidity required by insurance holding companies. 
We cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of insurance or what effect any such measures would have on Allstate. We are working for changes in the regulatory environment to make insurance more available and affordable for customers, encourage market innovation, improve driving safety, strengthen cybersecurity, and promote better catastrophe preparedness and loss mitigation.
Agent and Broker Compensation.    In recent years, several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents and 


brokers by insurance companies. The proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers. 
Limitations on Dividends by Insurance Subsidiaries.    As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate Corporation relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt or to fund non-insurance-related businesses. Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois, and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see Part II, Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. The laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends. However, such laws in some jurisdictions may be more restrictive.
Insurance Holding Company Regulation – Change of Control.    The Allstate Corporation and Allstate Insurance Company are insurance holding companies subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business. In the U.S., these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin. Additionally, some of these subsidiaries are considered commercially domiciled in California and Florida. 
Generally, the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of “control” of a domestic or commercially domiciled insurer or of any person that controls such an insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator. In general, a presumption of “control” arises from the ownership, control, possession with the power to vote, or possession of proxies with respect to ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurer or of a person who controls an insurer. In addition, certain state insurance laws require pre-acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non-domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state. While such pre-acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, such statutes do authorize certain remedies, including the issuance of a cease-and-desist order with respect to the non-domestic insurer if certain conditions exist, such as undue market concentration. 
Thus, any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of The Allstate Corporation’s common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Texas and Wisconsin. Moreover, notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions and where the 


The Allstate Corporation  13

2018 Form 10-K Item 1. Business

insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business. Such approval requirements may deter, delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of The Allstate Corporation’s common stock.
Rate Regulation.    Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state’s regulatory authority. In many cases, such rating plans, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use.
The speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the rating laws are (i) prior approval, (ii) file-and-use or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a rate before the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator’s approval to use a rate, but the rate must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Eighteen states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of rating laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing.
An insurer’s ability to adjust its rates in response to competition or to changing costs is dependent on an insurer’s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its rates or proposed rating plan meets the requirements of the rating laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer’s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer’s ability to charge a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability.
From time to time, the personal lines insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special-interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set rates at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs, catastrophe loss exposure, and expenses. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. Allstate and other insurers are using increasingly sophisticated pricing models and rating plans that are reviewed by regulators and special-interest groups. State regulators may interpret existing law or rely on future legislation or regulations to impose new restrictions that adversely affect profitability or growth. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding insurance rates.
Involuntary Markets.    As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or 


entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations.
For a discussion of these items see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. Note 14 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.
Indemnification Programs.    We are a participant in state-based industry pools, facilities or associations, mandating participation by insurers offering certain coverage in their state, including the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association, the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association, the North Carolina Reinsurance Facility and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. We also participate in the Federal Government National Flood Insurance Program. 
For a discussion of these items see Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements. Note 10 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. 
Guaranty Funds.    Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies. We do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact on Allstate from these assessments.
Investment Regulation.    Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments.
Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies.    Most states regulate an insurer’s ability to exit a market. For example, states may limit, to varying degrees, an insurer’s ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states restrict or prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets.
Variable Life Insurance and Registered Fixed Annuities.    The sale and administration of variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”).
Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisors and Investment Companies.    The Allstate entities that operate as broker-dealers, registered investment advisors, and investment companies are subject to 


14  www.allstate.com

Item 1. Business 2018 Form 10-K
regulation and supervision by the SEC, FINRA and/or, in some cases, state securities administrators. Certain state and federal regulators, such as the SEC, are considering implementation of best interest standards. Such proposals, if effective, could impact products provided by Allstate agencies and Allstate’s broker-dealers, their sales processes, volumes, and producer compensation arrangements.
Dodd-Frank: Covered Agreement.  The Secretary of the Treasury (operating through FIO) and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (“USTR”) are jointly authorized, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank, to negotiate Covered Agreements. A Covered Agreement is a bilateral or multilateral agreement that “relates to the recognition of prudential measures with respect to the business of insurance or reinsurance that achieves a level of protection for insurance or reinsurance consumers that is substantially equivalent to the level of protection achieved under State insurance or reinsurance regulation.”
On September 22, 2017, the U.S. and European Union (“EU”) signed a Covered Agreement. In addition to signing the Covered Agreement, Treasury and the USTR jointly issued a policy statement clarifying how the U.S. views implementation of certain provisions of the Covered Agreement. The policy statement affirms the U.S. system of insurance regulation, including the role of state insurance regulators as the primary supervisors of the business of insurance and addresses several other key provisions of the Covered Agreement for which constituents sought clarity, including prospective application to reinsurance agreements and an affirmation that the Covered Agreement does not require development of a group capital standard or group capital requirement in the U.S.
The U.S. has five years from the date of signing to amend its credit for reinsurance laws and regulations to conform with the requirements of the Covered Agreement or face federal preemption determinations by the FIO. To address the requirements of the Covered Agreement, the NAIC has formally adopted plans to revise the existing credit for reinsurance model law and model regulation to conform with the requirements of the Covered Agreement with the expectation that states will adopt and implement the modified model law and regulation. In addition, the NAIC plans to adopt reinsurance collateral requirements for reinsurers domiciled in NAIC qualified jurisdictions, other than those in the EU, consistent with those in the Covered Agreement provided the qualified jurisdictions also comply with the group capital mutual recognition and information sharing provisions of the Covered Agreement.
On December 18, 2018, the U.S. and the United Kingdom (“UK”) signed a separate Covered Agreement consistent with the U.S.-EU Covered Agreement to coordinate regulation of the insurance industry doing business in the U.S. and UK in the event the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Consistent with steps taken when the U.S. signed the U.S.-EU Covered Agreement in 2017, Treasury and the USTR also issued a policy statement regarding implementation of the U.S.-UK Covered Agreement affirming the role that state 


insurance regulators play as the primary supervisors of the insurance industry. The signing begins a review period in the UK that lasts for 21 legislative days. The Covered Agreement has also been submitted to Congress on December 11, 2018 for a period of 90 calendar days after which the U.S.-UK Covered Agreement may become effective without further congressional approval.
Division Statute. On November 27, 2018, the Illinois General Assembly passed legislation authorizing a statute that makes available a process by which a domestic insurance company may divide into two or more domestic insurance companies. The statute could be used to isolate an existing block of life, health, annuity or property-casualty business for sale to a third party or to manage risks associated with indemnification programs. The statute could also be used to divide continuing blocks of insurance business from insurance business that is no longer marketed, or otherwise has been discontinued, into separate companies with separate capital. Before a plan of division can be effected, it must be approved according to the organizational documents of the dividing insurer and submitted for approval by the Illinois Department of Insurance. The bill was effective January 1, 2019. The Illinois Department of Insurance will likely promulgate rules and the rule-making process will take several months once filed. 
Privacy Regulation and Data Security.    Federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures and disposal of customer information. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information.
Asbestos.    Congress has repeatedly considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past. In February 2017, legislation was introduced in the House titled the Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency Act of 2017 (the “FACT Act”). The FACT Act requires transparency of asbestos trust funds that are formed under a reorganization plan following the discharge in bankruptcy of a debtor corporation, quarterly reports on claims made to the trusts, and the release of information sought by defendants in asbestos lawsuits. The House Judiciary Committee approved the FACT Act, but a full House vote has not occurred. In 2017, the House introduced an additional bill called the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act of 2017. This legislation passed the House and is with the Senate Judiciary Committee. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos.
Environmental.    Environmental pollution and clean-up of polluted waste sites is the subject of federal and state regulation. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability 


The Allstate Corporation  15

2018 Form 10-K Item 1. Business

Act of 1980 (the “Superfund”) and comparable state statutes (the “mini-Superfunds”) govern the clean-up and restoration of waste sites by Potentially Responsible Parties (“PRPs”). The Superfund and the mini-Superfunds (collectively, the “Environmental Clean-up Laws” or “ECLs”) establish a mechanism to assign liability to PRPs or to fund the clean-up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP depends on a variety of factors. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean-up of waste sites by insured PRPs and the insured parties’ alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean-up. The insurance industry, including Allstate, has disputed and is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether the Superfund response, investigation, and clean-up costs are considered damages under the policies; whether coverage has been triggered; whether any pollution exclusion applies; whether there has been proper notice of claims; whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend; whether there is an appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers; and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an “occurrence.” Identical coverage issues exist for clean-up and waste sites not covered under the Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. 
Allstate’s exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may be, named as PRPs is uncertain. While comprehensive Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, only modest reform measures have been enacted. In May 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency created a Superfund Task Force that issued proposed reforms in a July 2018 report. These recommendations address expediting clean-up and remediation processes, reducing the financial burden of the clean-up process, encouraging private investment, promoting redevelopment and community revitalization, and building and strengthening partnerships. We cannot predict which, if any, of these reforms will be enacted.
