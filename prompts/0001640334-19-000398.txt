General Overview
 
Our company was incorporated on May 25, 2014 under the name “Formigli, Inc.” Our company was originally formed with the intent to engage in the worldwide distribution of custom handmade Italian road bikes, made by Renzo Formigli.
Our headquarters are located at 12A, Greenhill Street, Dept. 106, Stratford Upon Avon, Warwickshire, United Kingdom CV37 6LF.
 
On December 3, 2015, Amy Chaffe, our former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and founder, decided to conduct a corporate restructuring. Our company filed Articles of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Florida Department of State whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by (i) changing our name to “Cloudweb, Inc.”, (ii) increasing our authorized number of shares of common stock from 100 million to 500 million, and (iii) increasing our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock by conducting a forward split of such shares at the rate of 100 shares for every one (1) share currently issued and outstanding and made submission to FINRA with respect to the corporate action and requested a change of ticker symbol to “CLOU”. Our company’s common stock is quoted on the Pink Sheets of the OTC Markets, under the symbol “CLOW”, and first traded on the OTC Markets in November 2015.
 
On January 28, 2016, our company concluded a Share Exchange Agreement entered into with Zhi De Liao (“Mr. Liao”), whereby our company issued 2,500,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Liao in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Data Cloud Inc. a Nevada corporation (“Data Cloud”). Data Cloud owned 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Web Hosting Solutions Ltd., a United Kingdom company (“WHS”), which it purchased from James Holland for US$72,000 (GBP 47,000) on November 25, 2015.

At the time WHS had been providing web hosting solutions for approximately ten (10) years and became a UK private limited company in 2012. In connection with the Share Exchange Agreement, our company elected to enter into the web hosting industry and discontinue our former business operations.
 
As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, Mr. Liao became our company’s executive officer and sole member of the Board of Directors. Concurrently, Mr. Liao, through his controlled entity, Letterston Investments Ltd., acquired 250,000,000 shares of common stock from our former officer and director Ms. Amy Chaffe. As a result, on the transaction date, Mr. Liao effectively controlled approximately 81% of our company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
 
On November 4, 2016, our company filed Articles of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Florida Department of State whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by changing our name to “Data Backup Solutions, Inc.” On November 10, 2016, our company filed Articles of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Florida Department of State whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by decreasing our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock by conducting a reverse split of such shares at the rate of 1 share for each one hundred shares (100) shares then currently issued and outstanding. The submission of the change of name to Data Backup Solutions, Inc. and the reverse stock split was not completed and the submission was closed.
 
On December 1, 2016, our company entered into an Employment Agreement with James Holland, who at that time, was acting as our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Technology Officer.
 
On April 1, 2017, we, entered into a Purchase Agreement with Yui Daing, an individual residing in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (the “Purchaser”), Data Cloud Inc., a Nevada corporation, and Web Hosting Solutions Ltd., a United Kingdom private company limited by shares (“WHS”). The transactions under the Purchase Agreement were completed on April 1, 2017 (the “Closing”). Prior to the Closing, Data Backup owned 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Data Cloud which owns 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of WHS,. Due to the continued consolidated losses experienced by our company as the result of the losses of our company’s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, WHS, which included $50,083 USD for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and $21,818 USD for the first three (3) months ended March 31, 2017, our company entered into the Purchase Agreement and transferred 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Data Cloud to a third party for nominal consideration in return. In connection with the Closing, the employment agreement with James Holland was terminated and Mr. Holland was removed from the positions of Chief Operating Officer and Chief Technology Officer.
 
The Purchase Agreement was approved by the shareholders of our company owning a majority of the voting stock of our company on April 1, 2017. The Closing of the Purchase Agreement occurred on April 1, 2017.
 
On October 1, 2017, a majority of stockholders of our company and the board of directors approved a change of name of our company from Data Backup Solutions, Inc. to the previous name, Cloudweb, Inc. Articles of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the name were filed with the Florida Secretary of State on October 18, 2017.
 
On October 27, 2017, a majority of stockholders of our company and board of directors approved a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of up to four hundred (400) old shares for one (1) new share of common stock. On November 30, 2017, FINRA approved the reverse stock split. The outstanding shares were restated retroactively.
 
Other than as set out herein, we have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business.
 
Discontinued Operations

Our Current Business
 
We are currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for merger with or acquisition of a target business. In certain instances, a target business may wish to become our subsidiary or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge. We have not yet begun negotiations or entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any definitive agreements.
 
Any new acquisition or business opportunities that we may acquire will require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation. If our company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds, our business may fail.
 
Management of our company believes that there are benefits to being a reporting company with a class of securities quoted on the OTCQB, such as: (i) the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; (ii) increased visibility in the financial community; (iii) the facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions; (iv) potentially improved trading efficiency; (v) potential stockholder liquidity; (vi) potentially greater ease in raising capital subsequent to an acquisition; (vii) potential compensation of key employees through stock awards or options; (viii) potentially enhanced corporate image; and (ix) a presence in the United States’ capital market.
 
We may seek a business opportunity with entities that have recently commenced operations, or entities who wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand business development activities, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.
 
In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is anticipated that our officers and directors will continue to manage our company.
 
As of the date hereof, we have not entered into any formal written agreements for a business combination or opportunity. When any such agreement is reached, we intend to disclose such an agreement by filing a current report on Form 8-K.
 
We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our company may be scarce, or we may be unable to obtain the ones that we want. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities.
 
Currently, we do not have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. We have been reliant on loans by affiliated and non-affiliated parties to provide financial contributions and services to keep our company operating. Further, we believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital from other sources until we locate a prospective merger candidate through which we can pursue our plan of operation. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail. We currently have no written or oral agreement from our majority shareholder to continue to provide financial contributions.
 
Employees
 
We have no employees and our officers and directors furnish their time to the development of our company at no cost.
