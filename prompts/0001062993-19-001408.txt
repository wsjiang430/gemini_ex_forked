ITEM 1. BUSINESSBusiness Overview
Leatt designs, develops, markets and distributes personal protective equipment for participants in all forms of motor sports and leisure activities, including riders of motorcycles, bicycles, snowmobiles and ATVs. The Company sells its products to customers worldwide through a global network of distributors and retailers. Leatt also acts as the original equipment manufacturer for neck braces sold by other international brands. 
 The Companys flagship products are based on the Leatt-Brace® system, a patented injection molded neck protection system owned by Xceed Holdings, designed to prevent potentially devastating injuries to the cervical spine and neck. The Company has the exclusive global manufacturing, distribution, sale and use rights to the Leatt-Brace®, pursuant to a license agreement between the Company and Xceed Holdings, a company owned and controlled by the Companys Chairman and founder, Dr. Christopher Leatt. The Company also has the right to use apparatus embodying, employing and containing the Leatt-Brace® technology and has designed, developed, marketed and distributed other personal protective equipment using this technology, as well as its own developed technology, including the Companys expanding range of body protection and helmet products which it markets under the Leatt Protection Range brand. In 2015 the Company initially launched the first products in its new helmet range and continues to establish its offerings within this product range. The Company believes that the new helmet range redefines head and brain protection with its groundbreaking 360-degree Turbine technology for concussion and brain rotation safety. These helmets offer superior head and brain protection in a shell that is smaller, very lightweight and super ventilated, even at low speeds. 
 The Companys research and development efforts are conducted at its research facilities, located at its executive headquarters in Cape Town, South Africa. The Company employs 3 full-time employees who are dedicated exclusively to research, development, and testing. The Company also utilizes consultants, academic institutions and engineering companies as independent contractors or consultants, from time to time, to assist it with its research and development efforts. Leatt products have been tested and reviewed internally and by external bodies. All Leatt products are compliant with applicable European Union directives, or CE certified, where appropriate. Depending on the market we have other certifications outside of CE. For the US market our motorcycle helmets comply with the DOT (FMVSS 218) helmet safety standard and our bicycle helmet complies with EN1078, as well as CPSC 1203. Our downhill specific bicycle helmets also comply with ASTM F1952. For our Australian Market our bicycle helmet complies with AS/NZS 2063. For the UK market our motorcycle helmets comply with ACU Gold. We are also in the process of certifying our GPX 3.5 helmet to JIS T 8133 for the Japanese Market. 
 Our products are manufactured in China under outsource manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers located there. The Company utilizes outside consultants and its own employees to ensure the quality of its products through regular on-site product inspections. Products purchased through international sales are usually shipped directly from our consolidation warehouse or manufacturers warehouses to customers or their import agents. 
 Leatt earns revenues through the sale of its products through approximately 60 distributors worldwide, who in turn sell its products to retailers. Leatt distributors are required to follow certain standard business terms and guidelines for the sale and distribution of Leatt products. Two Eleven and Leatt SA directly distribute Leatt products to retailers in the United States and South Africa, respectively. 
 Our Corporate History and Structure
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 11, 2005 under the name Treadzone, Inc. Until March 2006, we were a shell company with little or no operations. Effective as of March 1, 2006, we acquired the exclusive global manufacturing, distribution, sale and use rights to the Leatt-Brace®, pursuant to a license agreement between the Company and Xceed Holdings, a company owned and controlled by the Companys Chairman and founder, Dr. Christopher Leatt. On May 25, 2005, we changed our name to Leatt Corporation in connection with our anticipated acquisition of the Leatt-Brace® rights. 
 Leatt South Africa
The Company conducts business in South Africa as a foreign registered branch known as Leatt Corporation (Incorporated in the State of Nevada) registered under the laws of South Africa with registration number: 2007/032780/10. Based in Cape Town, South Africa, Leatt SA was formed on November 14, 2007, for conducting the Companys business and operations in South Africa. Our corporate headquarters and our research and development efforts are based at Leatt SA.

Establishment of Two Eleven, Three Eleven and Leatt USA
On August 17, 2007, the Company established Two Eleven Distribution, a California limited liability company, as its wholly-owned subsidiary. Located in Santa Clarita, California, Two Eleven was formed to serve as the Companys executive offices in the United States, as well as the exclusive distributor of Leatt® products in the United States. 
 Southern Palace Investments 409 (Proprietary) Limited, a South African company, was established on October 12, 2007, by the Company, to engage in the manufacturing and distribution of sporting goods and protective gear. The company was inactive until March 2009, when it acquired all intellectual property rights related to an invention entitled the Helmet® from Xceed Holdings, for an aggregate purchase price of ZAR 943,480 (approximately, $90,000) pursuant to a patent assignment agreement, effective as of January 1, 2009, between Xceed Holdings and Southern Palace, doing business as Three Eleven Distribution. On February 10, 2010, Southern Palace formally changed its name to Three Eleven Distribution to reflect its business purpose. 
 On June 26, 2010, the Company established Leatt USA, LLC, a Nevada Limited Liability Company, as our wholly-owned subsidiary and for the purpose of holding our California subsidiary, Two Eleven Distribution. However, as of the date of this annual report the Company had not moved forward with its original plan and Leatt USA remains dormant. 
 Settlement Agreement
As consideration for their founding of the Companys operations in South Africa, we agreed to issue 20,000,000 shares of our common stock, and 19,200,000 shares of our preferred stock to Dr. Leatt, 5,000,000 shares of our common stock and 4,800,000 shares of our preferred stock to Jean-Pierre De Villiers, and 50,000 shares of our common stock to Ervian Jarrett. We issued the common stock to Dr. Leatt, Mr. De Villiers and Ms. Jarrett in accordance with the agreement, but we did not issue any preferred shares to Dr. Leatt or Mr. De Villiers. On September 25, 2008, in settlement of our obligation to issue Dr. Leatt and Mr. De Villiers shares of preferred stock, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with them, pursuant to which they agreed to release us from any and all liability arising out of or related to our failure to satisfy our prior obligation to them, and we issued 16,800,000 shares of our common stock and 2,400,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to Dr. Leatt, and 4,200,000 shares of our common stock and 600,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to Mr. De Villiers. The Series A Preferred Stock entitles Dr. Leatt and Mr. De Villiers to one hundred votes for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held (voting with the common stock as a single class). The Series A Preferred Stock converts into common stock, on a one-for-one basis, has a liquidation preference equal to $0.001 par value per share and is redeemable by us at $0.001 par value per share upon the occurrence of specified events, but it is subject to transfer limitations and it does not entitle Dr. Leatt and Mr. De Villiers to dividends. On September 20, 2012, we effected a 1-for-25 reverse stock split which reduces the foregoing issuances on a 1:25 ratio.

 Our Industry and Market Trends
Off-Road Motorcycle Market
Our products have their roots in the off-road motorcycle market. Our revolutionary neck brace was invented by Dr. Leatt to protect from catastrophic neck injuries after he witnessed the death of a fellow off-road motorcycle rider the weekend after his sons riding debut. As a result, our original products target participants in off-road cycling activities such as BMX racing and downhill racing. 
 We believe that we have gained our market share largely due to the innovation and quality of our products, the growth of the market, our increased marketing efforts, and our steps to secure our international patents and protect our patents from infringement. 
 Downhill and Cycling Market
We design and sell neck braces, helmets and protective gear for the downhill and cycling market. We entered this market focusing on downhill cycling, which requires a full-face helmet. We have since expanded our protective gear range to address the needs of mountain biking and BMX riders. The downhill and cycling market is now our second largest market. 
 Other Recreational Markets
We also design and sell neck braces for use by participants in other recreational sports such as ATV, go-kart, snowmobile users and participants in other sports where a full-face helmet should be worn. As a result, our overall performance in the market is also affected by the performance of these industries, especially in jurisdictions where the use of helmets is compulsory. 
 Our Products
The Company designs, develops, distributes and markets protective gear, parts and accessories. The Company currently markets its products under the two main categories addressing the two main markets, namely bicycle and powersports. 
 Neck braces 
 The Leatt-Brace® is a prophylactic neck bracing system composed of various combinations of carbon fiber, glass fiber, polycarbonate or Glass Filled Nylon, which was designed to help prevent potentially devastating sports injuries to the cervical spine (neck). The first LeattBrace® was designed for motorcycle, high speed motor vehicle and ATV use, where there is little means of protecting the neck in the event of an accident, but the Leatt-Brace® has been designed in such a way as to offer neck protection to all who utilize a crash helmet as a form of protection, including soldiers, law enforcement officers and other professionals whose activities could result in cervical spine injury.

Body Armor 
 In 2010, we launched the Leatt body armor range with our introduction of the Leatt Adventure Chest Protector, a hard-shell chest protector. The following year we introduced junior protectors, body vests and full body protectors. Since then we have further extended our range to include more body protectors and vests, back protectors, elbow guards, knee guards, impact shorts and cooling vests. These products come in a variety of soft- and hard-shell options for both adult and junior riders. Our expanded body armor product range has also gained us entry into new markets.
 In 2014, we have expanded into shoulder and knee-brace markets with the addition of our new shoulder brace and C-Frame knee brace to our range of body protection products. In the 2015 first quarter our Knee Brace was accepted for registration by both the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UKs Medicine and Healthcare Regulatory Products Agency (MHRA), and our Shoulder Brace was accepted by the FDA, as Class 1 Medical Devices. FDA and MHRA registration will allow us to take these products directly to market as medical devices for patients (not just athletes) recuperating from injuries, surgery, muscle tears or strains, dislocations, breaks or fractures. The Company has expanded its knee brace range to include the Knee Brace C-Frame Pro Carbon, which is the premium knee protection in the range, the Knee Brace X-Frame, which is injected carbon cage-type knee protection, the Knee Brace Z-Frame, which is glass-filled nylon knee protection product at a competitive price point, and the Knee Brace Carbon Junior, which is premium knee protection designed for younger athletes.

 We also provide aftermarket support to users of our protective products primarily for the replacement of worn or damaged parts through our global distribution network. The nature of many of our products is such that certain components collapse and fail in a controlled mode to help prevent further bodily injury. As such, specific parts of a product or the entire product may need to be replaced after a significant impact.

We have sold in excess of 750,000 units of Leatt-Brace® products worldwide primarily to the off-road motorcycle and bicycle markets to date. Approximately 9% of our 2010-unit sales were from our DBX bicycle neck brace. This has increased consistently over time with sales of our DBX bicycle neck brace accounting for 17% of unit sales in 2018. We continue to develop neck brace products for markets outside of our core markets. 
 Manufacturing
 Our products are manufactured in China in accordance with our manufacturing specifications, pursuant to outsourced manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers located there. Our third-party manufacturers usually have the capacity to produce more than 120,000 neck braces per year and have the space to expand such capacity as required. We do not currently have written agreements with our neck brace third-party manufacturers but will include any such future written agreement with our periodic filings. We have a manufacturing agreement with our Helmet manufacturer and will file agreements as they become material. We generally offer a 2-year warranty on our products in accordance with EU regulations. Products purchased through international sales are usually shipped directly from our consolidation warehouse or manufacturers warehouses to customers or their import agents. 
 Upon our determination of order quantities, we issue periodic purchase orders for products to our third-party manufacturers at negotiated prices. A security deposit of between 10  30% of the total purchase order value is made with such manufacturers upon receipt of a manufacturers invoice reflecting quantities ordered and the negotiated price for the products. The standard lead time from purchase order date to ship-ready date is 70-90 days, and our standard supplier shipping terms are FOB (Port). 
 During production, we measure the manufacturers quality and on-time performance to determine whether to continue our relationship. We utilize outside consultants and our own employees to ensure the quality of our products through regular on-site product inspections. Such quality inspections are conducted in conformance with ISO/IEC 17025 specifications at the manufacturers premises and penalties are levied against a manufacturer if any delay in shipment to customers or customer rejection or non-acceptance is caused by quality issues. The balance of open invoices is paid to the manufacturer four to six weeks after successful inspection. 
 Raw Materials and Suppliers 
 Our products are manufactured from generally available engineering materials, such as thermoset carbon fiber, glass fiber reinforced nylon and high impact polycarbonate resin. The cost of materials used in our products varies depending on the target market for, and the price of, our products. The prices of these raw materials are determined based upon prevailing market conditions, supply and demand, and global conditions may impact the supply of these raw materials and adversely affect the supply of our products. We have not experienced any interruptions to our production due to shortage of our raw materials. 
 Our third-party manufacturers arrange for the purchase of most of the raw materials that are used to manufacture our products and they pay for the cost of such materials. We may occasionally directly source and pay for highly specialized protection materials, for use in the production of our products. These protection materials are generally available. We also occasionally acquire raw materials on behalf of a third-party manufacturer in order to secure and maintain a specified production capacity. The expenses incurred for such materials for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, were not material and we do not foresee these amounts being material in the near future. 
 We have implemented certain protocols to check the quality of raw materials used in the production process. Our third-party manufacturers are required to perform prescribed strength testing on critical parts of certain products. In addition, certain materials are tested by our research and development staff at Leatt SA and by independent material laboratories for compliance to manufacturing and material specification.

Our Customers
 Leatt earns revenues through the sale of its products to customers worldwide through a global network of distributors and retailers. Leatt also acts as the original equipment manufacturer for neck braces sold by certain international brands. Leatt sells its products directly to distributors in South Africa (through Leatt SA), in the USA (through Two Eleven), and through a network of approximately 60 third-party distributors worldwide. Our distributors are required to follow certain standard business terms and guidelines for the sale and distribution of our products. Two Eleven also sells our products directly to consumers through our online store available at www.leatt.com. 
 Products purchased through international sales are usually shipped directly from our consolidation warehouse or manufacturers warehouses to customers or their import agents. Revenue and related cost of revenue is recognized at the time of shipment from the manufacturers port when shipping terms are Free on Board (FOB) shipping point, Cost and Freight (CFR) or Cost and Insurance to named place (CIP) as legal title and risk of loss to the product pass to the customer. 
 We generate revenue both in the United States and internationally. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, annual revenues associated with international customers were $16,090,800 and $12,827,572, or 66% and 64% of total revenue, respectively. 
 We have derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers, however none of our customers account for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our largest customer accounted for approximately 12% and 10% of our annual U.S. revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, $55,306 or 3% and $147,711 or 6% of our accounts receivable was due from this customer. 
 For both years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our international revenue derived outside of the U.S. was earned from one customer that accounted for approximately 8% of our annual international revenue. As of both December 31, 2018, and 2017, $0, or 0% of our accounts receivable, respectively, was due from this international customer. 
 Advertising and Marketing
We first gained market recognition through customer word-of-mouth and later through third-party articles and reviews of the Leatt-Brace® in motorcycle and racing magazines, and unsolicited and unpaid endorsements from current and former celebrity motocross (and other) riders, but we now advertise our products in various motorsport industry magazines, social media and in related online media. We also enhance our image through the sponsorship of sporting events, teams and individuals. 
 We believe that, as a result of our marketing efforts, and based on our internal marketing estimates, we have approximately 797 active distributors and dealers who stock Leatt products in the U. S. and approximately 186 active distributors and dealers in South Africa. We expect that the number of our distributors and dealers will also grow as the market segments that we sell to and our product offering grows but we cannot guarantee that this will be the case. 
 Our advertising and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $1,881,368 and $1,690,408, respectively, representing approximately 8% of our revenues for both periods. 
 Our Growth Strategy
We are committed to growing our business in the coming years. The key elements of our growth strategy are summarized below: 
 

Regional Distribution. Our product range has attracted the interest
 of global retailers and distributors of protective gear for motor and extreme
 sports, as well as automotive and motorcycle manufacturers and racing teams
 like the KTM teams. The resultant interest and the expected demand for our
 products have prompted us to change our production and distribution strategy
 in order to cater to this demand. In November 2007, we established Two Eleven,
 our wholly owned California subsidiary, to manage and control the distribution
 of our products, particularly in the United States. We distribute products to
 international consumers through a network of international distributors who
 are selected by our management team based on their financial status and
 creditworthiness, their location in major geographic locations, their
 marketing and media presence, their portfolio of leading motorcycle brands and
 accessories, and their reputation among industry players. We are working on
 developing our bicycle distribution network throughout the world by appointing
 new distributors and dealers with a specific focus on the bicycle market. We
 believe that regional distributors will better promote our products in the
 designated regions and expand our global customer base. In the U.S we are
 expanding and upgrading our dealer network and sales management team. 
 

Strategic Alliances. We are actively researching and evaluating
 strategic alliances that will enable the Company to grow into markets outside
 of its core markets in an efficient manner. We are also working with our OEM
 partners to develop more mutually beneficial, sustainable, long-term
 relationships in line with the Companys goals.

Industry Accreditation and Endorsements. We are pursuing
 accreditation and endorsements of our products from global motor sports
 governing and homologation bodies as well as industry organizations. We
 believe that these accreditations and endorsements will increase sales of our
 products and solidify our position as a leader in safety products. SFI testing
 is compulsory for neck protection used in automotive racing in the United
 States, therefore should neck protection in two wheeled sports become
 compulsory we believe that such accreditations and endorsements will
 additionally increase our sales. 
 

Developing Brand Awareness and Brand Loyalty. We are continuing with
 our efforts to develop brand loyalty by refining our marketing strategy and by
 engaging in more targeted communication with current and potential consumers
 of our products. We are working to build loyalty among more consumers in our
 core bicycle and moto markets by introducing more price points for our
 products and addressing more consumer needs in more segments, while remaining
 true to our missionpioneering functional safety gear. 
 

Expanding our Portfolio of Products. We are always looking for
 opportunities to introduce new products to reach a wider audience and
 penetrate new markets. This will include extending our product range to
 include both innovative protection products as well as peripheral or accessory
 products such as clothing. In the 2015 first quarter our Knee Brace was
 accepted for registration by both the United States Food and Drug
 Administration (FDA) and the UKs Medicine and Healthcare Regulatory
 Products Agency (MHRA), and our Shoulder Brace was accepted by the FDA, as
 Class 1 Medical Devices. FDA and MHRA registration will allow us to take these
 products directly to market as medical devices for patients (not just
 athletes) recuperating from injuries, surgery, muscle tears or strains,
 dislocations, breaks or fractures. In 2016, we launched two additions to our
 body armor product range, namely helmets and gloves. We also added two full
 apparel lines to our product rangeone line designed for the off-road
 motorcycle market and the other designed for the bicycling market. We expect
 that our sales of peripheral products and accessories will increase in line
 with increased brand awareness. 
Our Research and Development Efforts
 Our Chairman and Founder, Dr. Christopher Leatt, is our primary research and development consultant and heads the research and development efforts conducted at our research facility, or Leatt Lab, located at our executive headquarters in Cape Town, South Africa. The facility houses a team of biomedical engineers and designers who ensure products are scientifically and mechanically sound. This facility features state of the art testing and prototyping equipment and sophisticated simulation models. Leatt also utilizes other consultants, academic institutions and engineering companies from time to time to assist us with our research and development efforts. 
 We believe that the development of new products and new technology is critical to our success. We are continuously working to improve the quality, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of our existing products. All our products have achieved CE certification when necessary.Depending on the market we have other certifications outside of CE. For the US market our motorcycle helmets comply with the DOT (FMVSS 218) helmet safety standard and our bicycle helmet complies with EN1078, as well as CPSC 1203. Our downhill specific bicycle helmets also comply with ASTM F1952. For our Australian Market our bicycle helmet complies with AS/NZS 2063. For the UK market our motorcycle helmets comply with ACU Gold. We are also in the process of certifying our GPX 3.5 helmet to JIS T 8133 for the Japanese Market. We are working to develop technology to expand our range of products with further innovation, comfort, ergonomics and market appeal. We believe that our scientific and medical approach to product development gives our products a competitive edge. 
 Our research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $1,412,866 and $1,358,512, respectively. These expenses included salaries for research and development staff as well as other direct product development and research costs. 
 Competition
We compete with a small number of dominant competitors in the neck brace and body protection market, some of whom have substantially greater financial and other resources than we currently have. According to the RacerX survey discussed elsewhere herein and available at http://mediakit.filterpubs.com/survey, our major competitors in the neck brace market is Atlas Brace USA, LLC, Alpinestars S.p.A and EVS Sports; our major competitor in the knee brace market is EVS Sports; and our major competitor in the body protection, apparel and helmet market is Fox Racing. 
 Competition is based on quality, price, reputation, industry endorsements and certifications, as well as, on product design, brand names, marketing support and distribution strategies. We believe that our products can be distinguished from the products offered by our competitors due to the fact that our products are innovative, safety tested, versatile, aesthetically appealing, priced competitively and comfortable without compromising quality and performance.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths include the following: 
 

Intellectual Property. Licensed patented technology allows us to
 provide a product that cannot easily be duplicated by our competitors. We have
 invested extensive resources to patent our products worldwide and have taken
 legal action to protect our intellectual property rights from infringement.
 

Diverse Multi-Cultural Skilled Management Team. Our management team
 is knowledgeable and experienced in the personal protective equipment
 industry, sports medicine and business development. Our executive corporate
 management team consists of Mr. Sean Macdonald, Dr. Christopher Leatt, Mr.
 Erik Olsson and Mr. Todd Repsher. Mr. Macdonald is our Chief Executive
 Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President and Director, and is a Chartered
 Accountant with 15 years experience in the financial and operational aspects
 of running sports orientated growth companies. Dr. Leatt is our Founder,
 Chairman and Research and Development consultant, who developed the Leatt-
 Brace® from his study of the benefits and viability of a neck protection
 system for helmet clad sport and recreational users. Mr. Olsson is our General
 Manager and Head of International Distribution and has served for over 20
 years as a Sales and
 Product Manager for various companies in the power sports industry. Mr. Repsher is our US General Manager,
 who is an award-winning sales executive with over 15 years experience in the
 marketing and sales of sports orientated companies in North America. 

Outsourced Manufacturing. We outsource our manufacturing to
 third-party manufacturers in order to produce large volumes of our products.
 The manufacturing process remains subject to our strict quality control
 guidelines safeguarded by our employees and the third-party inspectors who we
 hire as consultants to ensure that these guidelines are being implemented at
 the production point. While such manufacturing arrangements pose a risk to our
 ability to safeguard our property technologies and may lead to increased
 costs, as discussed under the Risk Factors heading in this report, we expect
 that the increase in expected sales volumes will contribute to a lower
 production cost per unit and that this will translate to better margins for
 our distributors and retailers. 

Research, Development, Certification and Marketing Capabilities. We
 have in-house know how in the areas of product development, testing and
 accreditation, particularly in the field of personal protective equipment.
 With the experience and capabilities developed and established in taking our
 product to market, we believe that we are well positioned to develop,
 manufacture and market additional products. With our medical and mechanical
 expertise, demonstrated research and development capabilities, established
 outsource manufacturing capacity, established brand and our dedicated, loyal
 and enthusiastic distribution network, we believe that we have the components
 necessary to bring new successful products to market. 

Industry Accreditation, Testing Standards and Regulations. We are
 pursuing accreditation and endorsements of our products from global motor
 sports governing and homologation bodies as well as industry organizations. We
 have obtained homologations of our products from various global racing
 authorities where objective standards have been set and we are in discussions
 with governing racing bodies, such as the CIK, to have the Leatt-Brace®
 accredited. Should industry accreditation become compulsory, we would be ahead
 of our competitors in the market place. 

Brand Recognition. We believe that public recognition of the Leatt®
 brand drives the sales of our products, regardless of the action of
 competitors and competitive products. We expect that the reputation of our
 brand in the market place, particularly our product testing and applicable CE
 certification, will continue to ensure market acceptance and facilitate market
 penetration of our new products. In order to bolster and grow the Leatt®
 brand, stringent quality control and assurance are our highest priority and
 our ongoing marketing, advertising and public relations efforts continue to
 stress the quality, safety and innovation of our products. 
 Our Intellectual Property
We believe that the continued success of our business is dependent on our intellectual property portfolio consisting of globally registered trademarks, design patents and utility patents related to the Leatt-Brace®. Most of these initial intellectual property rights are held by Xceed Holdings, a corporation controlled by our Chairman, Dr. Christopher Leatt and the rest of these rights are held by the Company and Three Eleven Distribution, our South African subsidiary. We license most of our intellectual property from Xceed Holdings, pursuant to a patent and royalty license agreement, or Licensing Agreement, dated March 1, 2006, between the Company and Xceed Holdings. Under the terms of the Licensing Agreement, we are obligated to pay Xceed Holdings 4% of all our revenues billed and recieved from the Leatt-Brace®. In addition, pursuant to a separate license agreement between us and Mr. De Villiers, we are obligated to pay a royalty fee of 1% of all our billed and received sales revenue, in quarterly installments, based on sales of the previous quarter, to a trust that is beneficially owned and controlled by Mr. De Villiers. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our technology.

____________________
* The Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, is an international agreement for filing patent applications having effect in up to 117 countries. Under the PCT, an inventor can file a single international patent application in one language with one patent office in order to simultaneously seek protection for an invention in up to 117 countries throughout the world. 
 Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Issued patents or patents based on pending patent applications or any future patent applications may not exclude competitors or may not provide a competitive advantage to us. In addition, patents issued or licensed to us may not be held valid if subsequently challenged and others may claim rights in or ownership of such patents. In addition, the validity and breadth of claims in protective gear technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, the extent of their enforceability and protection is highly uncertain.

 * A Community Trade Mark or CTM, is any trademark which is pending registration or has been registered in the European Union as a whole (rather than on a national level within the EU). The CTM system creates a unified trademark registration system in Europe, whereby one registration provides protection by being enforceable in all member states of the EU. 
 ____________________ 
 From time to time, we have had to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation and we may be required to do so in the future. Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without paying us. We cannot assure you that our competitors have not developed or will not develop similar products, will not duplicate our products, or will not design around any patents issued to or licensed by us. We believe that a loss of these rights would harm or cause a material disruption to our business and, our corporate strategy is to aggressively take legal action against any violators of our intellectual property rights, regardless of where they may be. 
 Our Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 49 full-time employees, 13 independent contractors and no part-time employees. The following table sets forth the number of our full-time employees by function as of December 31, 2018.

 We are required to pay UIF, or unemployment insurance, for each of our South African employees. We are also required to withhold income taxes for our South African and U.S. based employees. We generally provide health care benefits and other standard benefits to our employees. During 2018, we did not have any pension or retirement plans for any of our employees. Effective January 1, 2019, we implemented a 401k plan for the benefit of all our U.S. based employees. 
 We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees, and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulty in recruiting staff for our operations. 
 Regulations
The 2012 JOBS Act
We qualify as an emerging growth company, as defined in Title I of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company is defined as an issuer, including a foreign private issuer, with less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during the most recently completed fiscal year. The SEC has interpreted total annual gross revenues to mean total revenues as presented on the income statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, which for the Company was $24.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. We will retain our status as an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the fifth anniversary of the date we first sell securities pursuant to an IPO registration statement; (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we first exceed $1 billion in annual gross revenues; (3) the time we become a large accelerated filer (an SEC registered company with a public float of at least $700 million); or (4) the date on which we have issued, within the previous three years, $1 billion of nonconvertible debt, whether issued in a registered or unregistered offering and whether or not it is still outstanding at the determination date. 
 The JOBS Act provides scaled disclosure provisions for us, including, among other things: (a) permitting us to include only two years of audited financial statements in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 for an IPO of common equity securities; (b) allowing us to comply with the smaller reporting company version of Item 402 of Regulation S-K (Executive Compensation); and (c) removing the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The JOBS Act also exempts us from the following additional compensation-related disclosure provisions that were imposed on U.S. public companies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act: the advisory say-on-pay vote on executive compensation required under Section 14A(a) of the Exchange Act; the Section 14A(b) requirements relating to shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation; the Section 14(i) requirements for disclosure relating to the relationship between executive compensation and financial performance of the issuer; and the requirement of Dodd-Frank Act Section 953(b)(1), which will require disclosure as to the relationship between CEO and median employee pay. 
 Under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act, "emerging growth companies" can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for compliance with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies.

European Union Directives
All our products are compliant with applicable European Union directives, or CE certified, where appropriate. All Leatt Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) products are CE Certified showing compliance with European Economic Community (EEC) directive 89/686/EEC that imposes mandatory accreditation of all Personal Protective Equipment products offered for sale in the EEC. This includes the Companys Leatt-Brace® and body protection products. 
 This means that as a minimum these products must comply with: the basic Health and Safety requirements of the directive; certain chemical innocuousness tests prescribed in EN 340:2003 - Protective clothing  General Requirements; and the requirements relating to usage, care, cleaning, sizing and other information to be supplied with the product. Accordingly, all Leatt-Braces®, chest protectors and body protection products are CE certified. Only our peripheral products such as jackets, clothing, and caps are not covered. 
 In addition to the minimum requirements the Company complies with the European Standards, or EN (European Norm), specific to certain categories of PPE. An EN is a standard that has been adopted by one of the three recognized European Standardization Organizations (ESOs): CEN, CENELEC or ETSI. It is produced by all interested parties (including manufacturers, users, consumers and regulators of a particular material, product, process or service) through a transparent, open and consensus-based process. In the Companys case these are the applicable EN standards: EN 14021 Stone Shields; EN 1621-1 Limb Protectors; EN 1621-2 Back Protectors; and CE EN1621-3 level 2 impact front Chest Protectors. These standards are more performance related and, among other things, measure the performance of PPE at various intensity levels and under different environmental conditions. They also prescribe product labeling, tests for user comfort and ease of use. Where no specific standards exist in the EU, such as with the neck brace, the Notifying Body will be responsible for CE evaluation and certification. 
 FDA and MHRA Registration 
 In the 2015 first quarter our Knee Brace was accepted for registration by both the FDA and the MHRA, and our Shoulder Brace was accepted by the FDA, as Class 1 Medical Devices. FDA and MHRA registration will allow us to take these products directly to market as medical devices for patients (not just athletes) recuperating from injuries, surgery, muscle tears or strains, dislocations, breaks or fractures. The Companys FDA registration included the contract manufacturer of the braces, a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) vendor. For the registration period, which currently expires in December 31, 2019, we will be required to maintain logs of complaints or problems, and to provide appropriate labeling for medical uses. We have renewed our registration until December 31, 2019. The MHRA registration of the knee brace is open-ended, subject to the Companys continued monitoring of product performance in the market place and delivery of prompt responses to the MHRA as necessary. 
 Other Accreditation 
 We have also obtained certifications for our helmets depending on the market, for the US market our motorcycle helmets comply with the DOT (FMVSS 218) helmet safety standard and our bicycle helmets comply with EN1078, as well as CPSC 1203. Our downhill specific bicycle helmets also comply with ASTM F1952. For our Australian Market our bicycle helmet complies with AS/NZS 2063. For the UK market our motorcycle helmets comply with ACU Gold. We are also in the process of certifying our GPX 3.5 helmet with JIS T 8133 for the Japanese Market. 
 We have also obtained certification for certain of our products, such as the MRX head and neck restraint system, by the SFI Foundation (USA), or the SFI. To attain SFI certification, a safety device must, every five years, pass a series of impact sled tests with an instrumented crash test dummy at a SFI accredited test lab, as well as flammability tests on various parts of the safety device. These tests are done according to the SFI38.1 specification that can be found at http://www.sfifoundation.com. SFI 38.1 accreditation is mandatory for any safety device that is used by participants in SFI sanctioned events worldwide.
 We also voluntarily submitted our Moto GPX neck brace to be tested by the in-house engineers of BMW Motorrad (Germany) and to be reviewed by KTM (Austria). We believe that such testing, while not mandatory, provides validation for our products performance.
