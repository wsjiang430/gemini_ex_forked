Item 1. Business
Overview
MongoDB is the developer data platform company whose mission is to empower developers to create, transform, and disrupt industries by unleashing the power of software and data. Our developer data platform is an integrated set of database and related services that allow development teams to address the growing variety of modern application requirements, all in a unified and consistent user experience.
The foundation of our platform is the world’s leading, modern general purpose database. Built on our unique document-based architecture, our database is designed to meet the needs of organizations for performance, scalability, flexibility and reliability while maintaining the strengths of relational databases. Every software application requires a database to store, organize and process data. Large organizations can have tens of thousands of applications and associated 
databases. A database directly impacts an application's performance, scalability, flexibility and reliability. As a result, selecting a database is a highly strategic decision that directly affects developer productivity, application performance and organizational competitiveness.
The global database market is dominated by legacy relational databases, which were first developed in the 1970s. Their underlying architecture remains largely unchanged even though the nature of applications, how they are deployed and their role in business has evolved dramatically. Modern software development is highly iterative and requires flexibility. Relational databases were not built to support the volume, variety and speed of data being generated today, hindering application performance and developer productivity. In a relational database environment, developers are often required to spend significant time fixing and maintaining the linkages between modern applications and the rigid database structures that are inherent in relational offerings. Further, relational databases were built before cloud computing and were not designed for “always-on” globally distributed deployments. These factors have left developers and their organizations in need of more agile and effective database alternatives. A number of non-relational database alternatives have attempted to address the limitations of relational databases, but they have not achieved widespread developer mindshare and marketplace adoption due to technical trade-offs in their product architectures and the resulting compromises developers are required to make in application development.
Our database combines the best of both relational and non-relational databases. We believe our core platform differentiation is driven by our ability to address the needs of organizations for performance, scalability, flexibility and reliability while maintaining the strengths of relational databases. Our document-based architecture enables developers to manage data in a more natural way, making it easy and intuitive for developers to rapidly and cost-effectively build, modernize, deploy and maintain applications, thereby increasing the pace of innovation within an organization. Customers can run our database in any environment, depending on their operational requirements: fully managed as a service or self-managed in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment. 
In addition to the database offering, our developer data platform includes additional capabilities that allow developers to address a broader range of application requirements. Our platform’s integrated capabilities allow organizations to reduce the need for disparate, single-purpose data technologies, thereby lowering the cost and complexity of their application infrastructure. These complementary capabilities of our platform include:
•Search. Extends the developer interface for working with the database to search operations, simplifying the development of rich search experiences in applications. It also eliminates the need to run a separate search engine alongside the database and maintains the sync between the two systems. 
•Time series. Supports the entire end-to-end cycle of applications that leverage time series data, from ingestion, storage and querying to native data visualization and automated data archival in a single platform, which removes the need for complex integration, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing cost. 
•Data lifecycle. Includes capabilities that help users more effectively manage the lifecycle of their application data. For example, MongoDB Atlas Online Archive helps users automatically tier aged data out of the database while keeping the data fully accessible. 
•Application-driven analytics. Includes a wide range of capabilities to help development teams build richer application experiences that rely on automatic, low-latency analytical processing of live data. This includes rich aggregations and indexing strategies, as well as dedicated analytics nodes for workload isolation.
•Mobile. Enables developers to easily build mobile applications independently or via a fully managed experience that syncs data stored on devices to a cloud database.
We compete in the database management software market, which is one of the largest in the software industry. According to IDC, the data management software market is forecast to be $95 billion in 2023 growing to approximately $138 billion in 2026, representing a 13% compound annual growth rate.
The MongoDB Advantage
The key differentiating features and capabilities of our developer data platform platform include:
We Built Our Platform for Developers.
MongoDB was built by developers for developers. We architected our platform with robust functionality and made it easy and intuitive for developers to build, modernize, deploy and maintain applications rapidly and cost-effectively, thereby increasing developer productivity. Our document-based architecture enables developers to manage and interact with data in a more natural way than legacy alternatives. As a result, developers can focus on the application and end-user experience, as they do not have to spend significant time fixing and maintaining the linkages between the application and a rigid relational database structure. We also develop and maintain drivers in all leading programming languages, allowing developers to interact with our platform using the programming language of their choice, further increasing developer productivity. According to the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey, MongoDB continues to be one of the top databases developers want to work with.
We Built a Platform for Modern Applications.
Our founders were frustrated by the challenges and limitations of working with legacy database offerings. Our platform was built to address these challenges and limits while maintaining the best aspects of relational databases, allowing developers both to build new, modern applications that could not be built on relational databases and to more quickly and easily modernize existing applications. While the percentage varies from quarter to quarter, over the course of the past fiscal year, approximately one quarter of our new business related to MongoDB Enterprise Advanced, our proprietary commercial database offering, resulted from applications that were migrated from legacy relational databases. 
Core features and benefits of our platform include:
•Versatility. Our developer data platform supports a broad range of workloads and offers our customers a host of features and services that complement our database offering. This integration provides a unique solution that precludes the need for single-purpose technologies, and allows our customers to reduce the cost and back-end complexity of their application infrastructure, as well as increase the speed of innovation.
•Performance. We deliver the extreme throughput and predictable low-latency required by the most demanding applications and leverage modern server architectures, delivering millions of operations per second.
•Scalability. Our architecture scales horizontally across thousands of servers, supporting petabytes of data and millions of users in a globally distributed environment. It is easy to add capacity to our platform in a modular, predictable and cost-efficient manner. Applications can be run anywhere in the world with our global multi-cloud reach.
•Flexibility and Control. MongoDB's intelligent distributed systems architecture enables users to easily place data where their applications and users need it. MongoDB can be run within and across geographically distributed data centers and cloud regions, providing levels of scalability, workload isolation and data locality to meet today's modern application requirements.
•Reliability. Our platform includes the critical, advanced security features and fault-tolerance that enterprises demand. It was built to operate in a globally distributed environment for “always-on” applications. Our multi-cloud and global reach empowers global applications to withstand regional outages while addressing the most demanding data security and privacy requirements.
We Allow Customers to Run Any Application Anywhere.
As a developer data platform, we support applications across a wide range of use cases. Our software is easily configurable, allowing customers to adjust settings and parameters to optimize performance for a specific application and use case. Customers can run our platform in any environment, depending on their operational requirements: fully managed as a service or self-managed in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment. Customers can deploy our platform in any of the major public cloud alternatives, providing them with increased flexibility and cost-optimization opportunities by enabling public cloud vendor optionality. Our customers have a consistent experience regardless of infrastructure, providing optionality, flexibility and efficiency.
Customers of MongoDB Atlas, our multi-cloud developer data platform offering, enjoy the benefits of using MongoDB as a service in the public cloud, further enabling developers to focus on their application performance and end-user experience, rather than the back-end infrastructure lifecycle management. With MongoDB Atlas, organizations only have to manage how their applications use the database and are freed from the tasks of infrastructure provisioning, configuring operating systems, upgrading software and more.
Key Customer Benefits
Our platform delivers the following key business benefits for our customers:
•Maximize Competitive Advantage through Software and Data. Our platform is built to support modern applications, allowing organizations to harness the full power of software and data to drive competitive advantage.

In addition, our platform runs on commodity hardware, requires less oversight and management from operations personnel and can operate in the cloud of choice or other low-cost environments, leading to reduced application-related overhead costs for our customers and lower total cost of ownership.
Our Products
Our customers can implement our developer data platform as a managed service offering, or they can choose a self-managed option. MongoDB Atlas is our managed multi-cloud database-as-a-service (“DBaaS”) offering that includes an integrated set of database and related services. MongoDB Enterprise Advanced is our proprietary self-managed commercial offering for enterprise customers that can run in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment.
MongoDB Atlas
In June 2016, we introduced MongoDB Atlas, our hosted multi-cloud database-as-a-service (“DBaaS”) offering that includes comprehensive infrastructure and management, which we run and manage in the public cloud. MongoDB Atlas provides customers with a highly flexible, managed offering that includes automated provisioning and healing, comprehensive system monitoring, managed backup and restore, default security and other features that reduce operational complexity and increase application resiliency. MongoDB Atlas allows customers to remove themselves from the complexity of managing the database and related underlying infrastructure, so they can instead focus on the application and end-user experience and innovate more quickly to better serve their own customers and capitalize on new business opportunities. 
Built for resilience, scale, and security, MongoDB Atlas is available in more than 100 regions worldwide across all three major cloud providers (Amazon Web Services (‘‘AWS’’), Google Cloud Platform (‘‘GCP’’) and Microsoft Azure), enabling our customers to leverage the benefits of different cloud platforms for different use cases and helping them avoid 
infrastructure vendor lock-in. The general availability of multi-cloud clusters on MongoDB Atlas allows organizations to deploy a fully managed, distributed database across multiple cloud providers simultaneously without the added operational complexity of managing data replication and migration across clouds. 
Over the years, we have introduced additional features and functionality, which have increased the capabilities of MongoDB Atlas and accelerated and expanded its adoption including Atlas Search, Atlas Device Sync, Atlas Data Federation and Atlas Charts.
More recently, MongoDB Atlas achieved the formal FedRAMP Moderate Authorized designation. MongoDB Atlas provides the software tools and services necessary for U.S. government organizations to quickly and easily build and deploy secure, highly-scalable, distributed applications in the AWS cloud. We believe MongoDB is positioned to capitalize on the popularity of MongoDB across a number of U.S. federal government agencies.
MongoDB Atlas represented 63%, 56% and 46% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
MongoDB Enterprise Advanced
MongoDB Enterprise Advanced is our proprietary self-managed commercial database offering for enterprise customers that can run in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment. MongoDB Enterprise Advanced is our subscription package that includes a commercial license to our platform and the following:
•MongoDB Enterprise Database Server. The MongoDB enterprise database server, called Enterprise Server, is our proprietary commercial database. It stores, organizes and processes data and facilitates access and changes to the data. Enterprise Server includes advanced security features, auditing functionality and enterprise-standard authentication and authorization, as well as encrypted and in-memory storage engines to enable a wide range of workloads.
•Enterprise Management Capabilities. MongoDB Enterprise Advance customers can choose either our Cloud Manager Premium product (for customers who want to manage our platform via the cloud) or Ops Manager (generally for those with on-premises deployments), our sophisticated suite of management tools that allows operations teams to run, manage and configure MongoDB according to their needs. 
•Analytics Integrations. We provide integrations to allow data and business analysts to analyze data in applications running on our platform using their existing business intelligence and analytics tools. Our analytics integrations ensure that enterprises can efficiently extract significant value from applications built on our platform.
MongoDB Enterprise Advanced represented 28%, 34% and 43% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Professional Services
We provide professional services to our customers, including consulting and training, with the goal of making customer deployments of our platform successful, thereby increasing customer retention and driving customer revenue expansion. Given that we have designed our platform to be easily deployed, our services typically do not involve implementation and are designed to facilitate a more rapid and successful deployment of MongoDB by our customers. Professional services are an important part of our customer retention and expansion strategy. Customers who purchase professional services have typically increased their subscription usage with our platform and have done so more quickly than customers who have not engaged with our professional services.
Professional services represented 4% of our total revenue for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Free Offerings
To encourage developer usage, familiarity and adoption of our platform, we offer Community Server and a free tier of MongoDB Atlas as “freemium” offerings. Community Server is a free-to-download version of our database that includes the core functionality that developers need to get started with MongoDB but not all of the features of our commercial platform. Community Server is available under a license that protects our intellectual property and supports our subscription business model. Our goal is to convert Community Server users to paying customers of our commercial subscription offerings of 
MongoDB Atlas or MongoDB Enterprise Advanced. Our Community Server has been downloaded over 365 million times from our website alone since February 2009. Our free tier of MongoDB Atlas provides access to our hosted database solution with limited processing power and storage, as well as certain operational limitations.
Unlike software companies built around third-party open source projects, we own the intellectual property of our offerings since we are the creators of the software, enabling our proprietary software subscription business model. Owning the intellectual property of our offering also allows us to retain control over our future product roadmap, including the determination of which features are included in our free or paid offerings.
Our Growth Strategy
We are pursuing our large market opportunity with growth strategies that include:
•Acquiring New Customers. We believe there is a substantial opportunity to continue to grow our customer base. We benefit from word-of-mouth awareness and frictionless experimentation by the developer community through our Community Server and MongoDB Atlas free tier offerings. As a result, our self-serve and direct sales prospects are often familiar with our platform and may have already built applications using our technology. While we sell to organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries, our key sales focus is on enterprises that invest more heavily in software application development and deployment. These organizations have a greater need for databases and, in the largest enterprises, can have tens of thousands of applications and associated databases. We plan to continue to invest in our direct sales force to grow our larger enterprise subscription base, both domestically and internationally.
•Expanding Sales Within Our Customer Base. We seek to grow our sales with our customers in several ways. As an application grows and requires additional capacity, our customers increase their spending on our platform. Our customers may expand their subscriptions to our platform as they migrate additional existing applications or build new applications, either within the same department or in other lines of business or geographies. Also, as customers modernize their information technology (“IT”) infrastructure and move to the cloud, they may migrate applications from legacy databases. Even within our largest customers, we believe we typically represent a small percentage of their overall spend on databases, reflecting our small market penetration. Our goal is to increase the number of customers that standardize on our database platform within their organization, which may include offering centralized internal support for developers within the organization or the deployment of an internal MongoDB-as-a-service offering. Our ability to expand within existing customers is demonstrated by our net annualized recurring revenue (“ARR”) expansion rate, which has consistently been over 120%. See Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K for a description of ARR and a discussion of our net ARR expansion rate.
•Extending Product Leadership and Introducing New Products. We intend to continue to invest in our product offerings with the goal of expanding the functionality and adoption of our platform. The guiding principle of our product innovation is to help developers solve more of their data challenges by utilizing our platform. During 2021, we improved the ease of use of our platform, by introducing innovation that facilitates data partitioning and expanded the breadth of functionality by introducing native time series support across our platform. During 2022, we continued to build on these improvements and further extended our offering. The new features, capabilities and improvements such as column store indexes, in-app analytics, Atlas Serverless, Atlas Device Sync, allow developer teams to accomplish more over a wider range of workloads while preserving a consistent developer experience and optimizing for modern application architectures. And with Queryable Encryption, we pioneered the industry’s first encrypted search scheme using breakthrough cryptography engineering. This technology gives developers the ability to query encrypted sensitive data in a simple and intuitive way with the data remaining encrypted at all times on the database.
•Fostering the MongoDB Developer Community. We have attracted a large and growing community of highly engaged developers, who have downloaded our Community Server offering over 365 million times from our website since February 2009 and over 125 million times in the last 12 months alone. We believe that the engagement of developers increases our brand awareness. Many of these developers become proponents of MongoDB within their organizations, which may result in new customers selecting our platform, as well as expansion opportunities within existing customers. Historically, we have invested in our community through active sponsorship of user groups, our user conferences, MongoDB University and other community-centered events. As of January 31, 2023, there were 
over 1.8 million MongoDB University registrations. We intend to continue to invest in the MongoDB developer community.
•Growing and Cultivating Our Partner Ecosystem. We have built a partner ecosystem of independent software vendors, systems integrators, value added resellers, cloud and technology partners. For example, we have expanded our business partnerships with all three major cloud providers (AWS, GCP and Microsoft Azure) to enhance our joint marketing initiatives, deliver technology integrations that benefit customers and align with our sales strategy. In addition, our technology partnerships have provided our customers with tools to help them modernize from legacy relational databases to MongoDB which, along with our other technology partnerships, provide us with significant benefits, including lead generation, new customer acquisition, marketplace fulfillment, accelerated deployment and additional customer support. We expanded our global partner ecosystem with the Alibaba Cloud partnership to offer an authorized MongoDB-as-a-Service solution to users in China. We subsequently expanded our reach in China in February 2021 when we launched a global partnership with Tencent Cloud that allows customers to easily adopt and use MongoDB-as-a-Service across Tencent’s global cloud infrastructure.We have also expanded our existing partnerships with independent software vendors and global systems integrators including IBM, Accenture, Infosys, Capgemini, Confluent, HCL, Wipro, Cognizant, Deloitte and Tata Consultancy Services. Our system integrator partners have also been valuable in working with organizations to migrate and modernize applications to our platform, including leveraging the cloud with MongoDB Atlas. We intend to continue to expand and enhance our partner relationships to benefit our global customers, grow our market presence and drive greater sales efficiency.
•Expanding Internationally. We believe there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand the use of our platform outside the United States. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, revenue generated outside of the United States was 45%, 46% and 44% of our total revenue. We intend to continue to expand our sales and drive the adoption of our platform globally.
Human Capital Management
We believe that our employees and the culture we have established are critically important to our success. To continue to compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, it is crucial that we attract, retain and motivate qualified employees. To support these objectives, we strive to maintain our company culture, offer competitive compensation and benefits, support the health and well-being of our employees, foster an inclusive, diverse and engaged workforce and develop talent.
As of January 31, 2023, we had a total of 4,619 employees, including 2,211 employees located outside the United States. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees. Generally, these laws and regulations are specific to the location of our business and we engage with legally recognized employee representatives in these locations as required. In accordance with the requirements of France, we have established a Social and Economic Committee composed of employer and elected staff representatives. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Compensation and Benefits
We provide competitive compensation and benefits for our employees globally. We continue to evolve our compensation programs to maintain competitive alignment with market practices while ensuring all pay decisions are driven by performance. Our compensation package may include base salary, commission or semi-annual bonuses and long-term equity awards. Where the market indicates, equity compensation continues to be an important tool to attract and retain talent. Employees in equity-eligible roles receive a new hire award at the time of hire and an annual performance-related refresh thereafter. To foster a strong sense of ownership and align our employees’ interests with our long-term success, we offer all full-time employees the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan.
In addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer employees a wide array of benefits designed to be aligned with local reward practices and help us successfully compete for talent. In the United States, these include health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, paid time off, retirement benefits and additional resources to support employees' overall well-being. While the philosophy around our benefits is the same worldwide, specific benefits may vary by country due to local regulations and preferences.
Health, Safety and Well-Being
We believe the health, safety and well-being of our employees are vital to our success. We have introduced guidelines, which reflect our commitment to both the physical and psychological health and well-being of our employees. As part of this commitment, we recognize our responsibility to provide a safe and healthy work environment for all employees, contractors, customers and visitors.
We prioritized employee safety during the COVID-19 pandemic by ensuring all employees were properly enabled to work remotely and by providing clarity on office closures and evolving guidelines. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced emergency caregiving leaves and promoted new and existing resources related to mental health. We also implemented additional measures to support our employees, such as company-wide days off and wellness checks throughout the pandemic. 
As conditions improved, we began to re-open our offices in the United States and certain other locations globally for employees to voluntarily return. In April 2022, we moved forward with a hybrid return-to-office approach. We implemented four working models, which help ensure that we are meeting business needs while also offering employees flexibility. As it relates to the in-office employee experience, we aim to provide opportunities for collaboration and social interaction, as well as training opportunities in managing a hybrid team for our people managers. We have several hub offices and a network of satellite offices in locations around the world and continue to introduce new workplace initiatives to enhance the employee experience.
As it relates to employee well-being, we offer a range of benefits under our four pillars of well-being:
•Physical well-being. We offer our employees access to highly comprehensive and competitive medical coverage in local markets, often covering the employee and dependent premiums. Our plans often include dental, optical, maternity, hospitalization and outpatient care, among other coverages. To promote healthy lifestyles, we also offer employees access to highly subsidized or discounted monthly gym and exercise class memberships.
•Financial well-being. We believe that financial security is an enabler of creativity and productivity, which is why we offer retirement saving options for our employees, as well as benefits such as life insurance, disability insurance, critical illness and accident coverage.
•Emotional well-being. Our employees and their families have 24-hour access to our Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”). Our EAP offers confidential guidance on matters such as family support, mental health and legal assistance. Through local partners, employees have access to free counseling and coaching sessions. Globally we also have a team of mental Health First Aiders, who are trained to be a point of contact for any of our employees experiencing emotional distress. In addition, all employees receive a complimentary subscription to a meditation app, which provides hundreds of themed meditation sessions on everything from sleep to focus to reducing stress.
•Family well-being. We provide global fertility benefits to our employees and their partners, including fertility care, adoption and surrogacy assistance and unlimited access to 1:1 guidance with certified practitioners. In the United States and some of our bigger geographies, we also offer backup childcare support. We feel strongly that parents should be able to share the responsibilities of caregiving and our parental leave policy gives all new parents at least 20 weeks of paid leave.
Talent & Leadership Development
Once we attract top talent, promoting their professional growth and development is an essential tool for retention and ensuring our continued success as we navigate the challenges of scaling in a competitive business environment. In addition to our ongoing delivery of professional and technical skill growth, we focus on two key levers for developing our talent. First, we are committed to developing talent using our performance and growth framework, which equips managers, and through them also equip employees, to meet and exceed high performance expectations, and make MongoDB a true inflection point in their careers. Second, we are focused on leadership development at all levels at MongoDB, which includes new manager onboarding, as well as leadership development for first-line managers and second-line leaders. Teams are also encouraged to seek customized leadership development programming for their leaders, to drive a precision focus on business needs.
Our Culture
We believe our culture is critical to our success and has delivered tangible financial and operational benefits for our customers, our employees and our stockholders. Our company values are:
•Think Big, Go Far. We are big dreamers with a passion for creativity. We eagerly pursue new opportunities and markets through innovation and disruption. We have a pioneering spirit - always ready to forge new paths and take smart risks.
•Build Together. We achieve amazing things by connecting and leveraging the diversity of perspectives, skills, experiences and backgrounds of our entire organization. We place the success of the company over any individual or team. We discuss things thoroughly, but prioritize commitment over consensus.
•Embrace the Power of Differences. We commit to creating a culture of belonging, where people of different origins, backgrounds and experiences feel valued and heard. This is cultivated by learning from and respecting each other’s similarities and differences. We approach conversations with positive intent and believe that others value the perspective we bring to the table. We recognize that a diverse workforce is the best way to broaden our perspectives, foster innovation and enable a sustainable competitive advantage.
•Make It Matter. We are relentless in our pursuit of meaningful impact. We think strategically and are clear on what we are and are not trying to do. We accomplish an amazing amount of important work and we are obsessed with delivering on our commitments.
•Be Intellectually Honest. We embrace reality. We apply high-quality thinking and rigor and operate with transparency. We have courage in our convictions but work hard to ensure biases or personal beliefs do not get in the way of finding the best solution.
•Own What You Do. We take ownership and are accountable for everything that we do. We empower and we are empowered to make things happen and balance independence with interdependence. We demand excellence from ourselves. We each play our own part in making MongoDB a great place to work.
Diversity & Inclusion
We are committed to building a diverse workforce and a culture that reflects our value of embracing the power of differences to drive better business outcomes.
We have expanded our efforts to recruit a more diverse workforce by embedding the capability to recruit diverse talent within our entire recruiting organization and investing in a diversity sourcing team that supports diverse recruitment marketing campaigns and external partnerships. 
We are investing in the development of diverse high potential talent within MongoDB, and we have launched Inclusive Leadership Training for all Vice-Presidents across the company. 
We also have a growing number of Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), including BEAM (Black Employees At MongoDB), Config.MDB (neurodivergent and people with disabilities), Green Team (sustainable, social, and environmental responsibility), MDBWomen (employees identifying as women), MongoDB_ API (Asian American and Pacific Islander community), Queer Collective (members of the LGBTQIA+ community and allies), Queeries (a safe environment for those identifying as LGBTQIA+), QueLatine (honoring the diversity of Latine heritage), Sell Like a Girl (those identifying as women in sales), UGT (underrepresented genders in tech), and Veterans (employees who are veterans of the armed forces). These groups focus on providing community support, professional development and business impact. Our ERGs play an important role in our overall company culture by helping us raise awareness of issues unique to their members’ experiences. 
As signatories to the Corporate Parity Pledge, we have committed to interview at least one qualified female candidate for every open role at the vice president level and above, as well as for every additional directorship on our Board of Directors. Additionally, we have partnered with Advancing Women in Tech to create a mentorship program focused on accelerating the growth of women and non-binary directors.
We are committed to pay equity, regardless of gender, ethnicity or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, job location and performance. In addition, to reduce the risk of bias and help ensure consistent pay practices, we use a third-party tool to conduct annual pay parity checks. 
Employee Engagement
We conduct anonymous engagement surveys regularly to help us understand the employee experience, identify areas of strength and development opportunities among teams, measure the effectiveness of our people and culture initiatives and understand employees’ sentiments on management. These surveys are managed by a third-party vendor to encourage candor. The results are reviewed by senior management, who analyze areas of progress or needs for improvement and work with their teams to determine actionable steps based on survey results. The results also drive organization-wide focus areas and commitments focused on leadership, culture and inclusion.
Our Customers
As of January 31, 2023, we had over 40,800 customers spanning a wide range of industries in more than 100 countries around the world. All affiliated entities are counted as a single customer. No single customer represented more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal year 2023. All affiliated entities are counted as a single customer and our definition of “customer” excludes users of our free offerings.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing teams work together closely to drive awareness and adoption of our platform, accelerate customer acquisition and generate and increase revenue from customers. While we sell to organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries, our key sales focus is on enterprises that invest more heavily in software application development and deployment. These organizations have a greater need for databases and, in the largest enterprises, can have tens of thousands of applications and associated databases. We plan to continue to invest in our direct sales force to grow our larger enterprise subscription base, both domestically and internationally.
Our go-to-market model is primarily focused on driving awareness and usage of our platform among software developers with the goal of converting that usage into paid consumption of our platform. We are a pioneer of developer evangelism and education and have cultivated a large, highly engaged global developer community. We foster developer engagement through community events and conferences to demonstrate how developers can create or modernize applications quickly and intuitively using our platform. We intend to continue to cultivate our relationships with developers through continued investment in and growth of our MongoDB Advocacy Hub, User Groups and MongoDB University.
To drive developer awareness of, engagement with, and adoption of our platform, we created our Community Server and MongoDB Atlas free tier offerings. These let developers use, experiment and evaluate our platform frictionlessly, which we believe has contributed to our platform’s popularity. We believe that developers are often advocates for us because of our developer-focused approach. As a result, our self-serve and direct sales prospects are often familiar with our platform and may have already built applications using our technology. In order to assess the most likely commercial prospects, we employ a process-oriented and data-driven approach to customer acquisition. We utilize advanced marketing technologies and processes to drive awareness and engagement, educate and convert prospects into customers. We also analyze usage patterns of our self-serve customers and free-tier users to identify those accounts that might benefit from engagement with our sales teams. As customers expand their usage of our platform, our relationships with them often evolve to include technology and business leaders within their organizations and our goal is to get organizations to standardize on our platform. Once our customers reach a certain spending level with us, we support them with customer success advocates to ensure their satisfaction and expand their usage of our platform. We also have a partner ecosystem of global system integrators, value-added resellers and independent software vendors, which we collectively refer to as strategic partners.
Our sales and marketing organization includes sales development, inside sales, field sales, sales engineering and marketing personnel. As of January 31, 2023, we had 2,249 employees in our sales and marketing organization.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are focused on enhancing our existing products and developing new products to extend our product leadership, increase our market penetration and deepen our relationships with our customers. Our research and development organization is built around small development teams. Our small development teams foster greater agility, which enables us to develop new, innovative products and make rapid changes to our infrastructure that increase resiliency and operational efficiency.
As of January 31, 2023, we had 1,030 employees in our research and development organization. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to extend our platform.
Competition
The worldwide database software market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are:
•mindshare with software developers and IT executives;
•product capabilities, including flexibility, scalability, performance, security and reliability;
•flexible deployment options, including fully managed as a service or self-managed in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment;
•ease of deployment;
•breadth of use cases supported;
•ease of integration with existing IT infrastructure;
•robustness of professional services and customer support;
•price and total cost of ownership;
•adherence to industry standards and certifications;
•size of customer base and level of user adoption;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts; and
•brand awareness and reputation.
We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above.
We primarily compete with established legacy database software providers such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and other similar companies. We also compete with public cloud providers such as AWS, GCP and Microsoft Azure that offer database functionality and non-relational database software providers.
Some of our actual and potential competitors, in particular the legacy database providers and large cloud providers, have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, more established relationships with current or potential customers and commercial partners, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios and broader global distribution and presence. Such competitors may make their products available at a low cost or no cost basis in order to enhance their overall relationships with current or potential customers. Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader offerings and can bundle competing products with hardware or other software offerings, including their cloud computing and customer relationship management platforms. Other large software and internet companies may also seek to enter our market. As we introduce new technologies, such as the ones we announced during fiscal year 2022, and as our existing markets see more market entry, we expect competition to intensify.
Seasonality
We have in the past and expect in the future to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenue and operating results from time to time. We may experience variability and reduced comparability of our quarterly revenue and operating results with respect to the timing and nature of certain of our contracts, particularly multi-year contracts that contain a term license. We may also experience fluctuations as MongoDB Atlas revenue is recorded on a consumption basis and varies with usage, including due to seasonal variability. As MongoDB Atlas revenue continues to increase as a percentage of total revenue, these fluctuations may have a greater impact on our results of operations.We believe that seasonal fluctuations that we have experienced in the past may continue in the future.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand.
As of January 31, 2023, in the United States, we had been issued 68 patents, which expire between 2030 and 2041 and had 37 patent applications pending, of which eight are provisional applications. In addition, as of January 31, 2023, we had 11 registered trademarks in the United States and three pending trademark application in the United States.
Unlike software companies built around open source projects, we own the intellectual property of our core offerings, allowing us to retain control over our future product roadmap, including the determination of which features are included in our free or paid offerings. All versions of Community Server released after October 16, 2018 are offered under the SSPL. Versions of Community Server released prior to October 16, 2018 are offered under the AGPL. Both the SSPL and the AGPL permit users to run the database without charge but subject to certain terms and conditions. The SSPL explicitly requires Community Server users that offer MongoDB as a third-party service to make publicly available the source code for all the programs used to offer such service. The AGPL requires users to make publicly available the source code for any modified version of the database that they distribute, run as a service or otherwise make available to end users. By contrast, we offer our Enterprise Server database under a commercial license that does not have this requirement and this is one of the reasons some organizations elect to buy a subscription including a commercial license to our platform. In addition, by offering Community Server under the SSPL and AGPL, we limit the appeal to other parties, including public cloud vendors, of monetizing our software without licensing it from us, further supporting our software subscription business model.
In addition, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.
