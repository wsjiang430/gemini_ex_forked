ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

General Overview
 McGrath RentCorp (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979 with corporate offices located in Livermore, California. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “MGRC”.  References in this report to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “ours” refer to McGrath RentCorp and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.
 The Company is a diversified business-to-business rental company with four rental divisions: relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes.  Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing business selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”).  The Mobile Modular business segment includes the Mobile Modular Portable Storage division, which represented approximately 8% of the Company’s 2018 total revenues.
 No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during 2018, 2017 and 2016.  Revenue from foreign country customers accounted for 4% of the Company’s revenues in 2018 and 2017, and 5% in 2016.
 Business Model
 The Company invests capital in rental products and generally has recovered its original investment through rents less cash operating expenses in a relatively short period of time compared to the product’s rental life.  When the Company’s rental products are sold, the proceeds generally have covered a high percentage of the original investment. With these characteristics, a significant base of rental assets on rent generates a considerable amount of operating cash flows to support continued rental asset growth. The Company’s rental products have the following characteristics:

• | The product required by the customer tends to be expensive compared to the Company’s monthly rental charge, with the interim rental solution typically evaluated as a less costly alternative.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Generally, we believe the Company’s customers have a short-term need for our rental products. The customer’s rental requirement may be driven by a number of factors including time, budget or capital constraints, future uncertainty impacting their ongoing requirements, equipment availability, specific project requirements, peak periods of demand or the customer may want to eliminate the burdens and risks of ownership. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | All of the Company’s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical rental term. Modular buildings (“modulars”) have an estimated life of eighteen years compared to the typical rental term of twelve to twenty-four months, electronic test equipment has an estimated life range of one to eight years (depending on the type of product) compared to a typical rental term of one to six months, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes have an estimated life of twenty years compared to typical rental terms of one to six months. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe short-term rental rates typically recover the Company’s original investment quickly based on the respective product’s annual yield, or annual rental revenues divided by the average cost of rental equipment. For modulars the original investment is recovered in approximately five years, in approximately three years for electronic test equipment and in approximately four years for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a product is sold from our rental inventory, a significant portion of the original investment is usually recovered. Effective asset management is a critical element to each of the rental businesses and the residuals realized when product is sold from inventory. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, coupled with ongoing repair and maintenance investments, to ensure its long useful rental life and generally higher residuals upon sale. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand and, once invested, proactively managing the equipment at the model level for optimum utilization through its technology life cycle to maximize the rental revenues and residuals realized. Liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes asset management requires selecting and purchasing quality product and making ongoing repair and maintenance investments to ensure its long rental life. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Company believes that rental revenue growth from an increasing base of rental assets and improved gross profits on rents are the best measures of the health of each of our rental businesses.  Additionally, we believe our business model and results are enhanced by operational leverage that is created from large regional sales and inventory centers for modulars, a single U.S. based sales, inventory and operations facility for electronic test equipment, as well as shared senior management and back office functions for financing, human resources, insurance, and operating and accounting systems.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 1,066 employees, of whom 87 were primarily administrative and executive personnel, with 577, 199, 127 and 76 in the operations of Mobile Modular, Adler Tanks, TRS-RenTelco and Enviroplex, respectively.  None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and management believes its relationship with our employees is good.

RELOCATABLE MODULAR BUILDINGS
 Description
 Modulars are designed for use as classrooms, temporary offices adjacent to existing facilities, sales offices, construction field offices, restroom buildings, health care clinics, child care facilities, office space, and for a variety of other purposes and may be moved from one location to another.  Modulars vary from simple single-unit construction site offices to multi-floor modular complexes.  The Company’s modular rental fleet includes a full range of styles and sizes.  The Company considers its modulars to be among the most attractive and well-designed available.  The units are constructed with wood or metal siding, sturdily built and physically capable of a long useful life. Modulars are generally provided with installed heat, air conditioning, lighting, electrical outlets and floor covering, and may have customized interiors including partitioning, cabinetry and plumbing facilities.
 Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications.   During 2018, Mobile Modular purchased 33% of its modular units from one manufacturer.  The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary modular manufacturers could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer lead times for delivery of modular units until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity.
 The Company’s modulars are manufactured to comply with state building codes, have a low risk of obsolescence, and can be modified or reconfigured to accommodate a wide variety of customer needs.  Historically, as state building codes have changed over the years, Mobile Modular has been able to continue to use existing modulars, with minimal, if any, required upgrades.  The Company has no assurance that it will continue to be able to use existing modular equipment with minimal upgrades as building codes change in the future.
 Mobile Modular currently operates from regional sales and inventory centers in California, Texas, Florida and Georgia, serving large geographic areas in these states, and sales offices serving North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. The California, Texas, Florida and Georgia regional sales and inventory centers have in-house infrastructure and operational capabilities to support quick and efficient repair, modification, and refurbishment of equipment for the next rental opportunity.  The Company believes operating from large regional sales and inventory centers results in better operating margins as operating costs can be spread over a large installed customer base. Mobile Modular actively maintains and repairs its rental equipment, and management believes this ensures the continued use of the modular product over its long life and, when sold, has resulted in higher sale proceeds relative to its capitalized cost.  When rental equipment returns from a customer, the necessary repairs and preventative maintenance are performed prior to its next rental. By making these expenditures for repair and maintenance throughout the equipment’s life we believe that older equipment can generally rent for rates similar to those of newer equipment.  Management believes the condition of the equipment is a more significant factor in determining the rental rate and sale price than its age.  Over the last three years, used equipment sold each year represented less than 2% of rental equipment, and has been, on average, 14 years old with sale proceeds above its net book value.
 Competitive Strengths
 Market Leadership – The Company believes Mobile Modular is the largest supplier in California, and a significant supplier in Florida and Texas, of modular educational facilities for rental to both public and private schools.  Management is knowledgeable about the needs of its educational customers and the related regulatory requirements in the states where Mobile Modular operates, which enables Mobile Modular to meet its customers’ specific project requirements.
 Expertise – The Company believes that over the more than 35 years during which Mobile Modular has competed in the modular rental industry, it has developed expertise that differentiates it from its competitors.  Mobile Modular has dedicated its attention to continuously developing and improving the quality of its modular units.  Mobile Modular has expertise in the licensing and regulatory requirements that govern modulars in the states where it operates, and its management, sales and operational staffs are knowledgeable and committed to providing exemplary customer service.  Mobile Modular has expertise in project management and complex applications.
 Operating Structure – Part of the Company’s strategy for Mobile Modular is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate.  Mobile Modular achieves this by building regional sales and inventory centers designed to serve a broad geographic area and a large installed customer base under a single overhead structure, thereby reducing its cost per transaction.  The Company’s regional facilities and related infrastructure enable Mobile Modular to maximize its modular inventory utilization through efficient and cost effective in-house repair, maintenance and refurbishment for quick redeployment of equipment to meet its customers’ needs.
 -4-


Asset Management – The Company believes Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Mobile Modular requires manufacturers to build to its specifications, which enables Mobile Modular to maintain a standardized quality fleet.  In addition, through its ongoing repair, refurbishment and maintenance programs, the Company believes Mobile Modular’s buildings are the best maintained in the industry.  The Company depreciates its modular buildings over an 18 year estimated useful life to a 50% residual value. Older buildings continue to be productive primarily because of Mobile Modular’s focus on ongoing fleet maintenance.  Also, as a result of Mobile Modular’s maintenance programs, when a modular unit is sold, a high percentage of the equipment’s capitalized cost is recovered. In addition, the fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by managing inventory through estimates of market demand, fulfillment of current rental and sale order activity, modular returns and capital purchases.
 Customer Service - The Company believes the modular rental industry to be service intensive and locally based.  The Company strives to provide excellent service by meeting its commitments to its customers, being proactive in resolving project issues and seeking to continuously improve the customers’ experience.  Mobile Modular is committed to offering quick response to requests for information, providing experienced assistance, on time delivery and preventative maintenance of its units.  Mobile Modular’s goal is to continuously improve its procedures, processes and computer systems to enhance internal operational efficiency.  The Company believes this dedication to customer service results in high levels of customer loyalty and repeat business.
Market
 Management estimates relocatable modular building rental is an industry that today has equipment on rent or available for rent in the U.S. with an aggregate original cost of over $5.0 billion. Mobile Modular’s largest market segment is for temporary classroom and other educational space needs of public and private schools, colleges and universities in California and Florida, and to a lesser extent in Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.  Management believes the demand for rental classrooms is caused by shifting and fluctuating school populations, the limited state funds for new construction, the need for temporary classroom space during reconstruction of older schools, class size reduction and the phasing out of portable classrooms compliant with older building codes (see “Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” below).  Other customer applications include sales offices, construction field offices, health care facilities, church sanctuaries and child care facilities.  Industrial, manufacturing, entertainment and utility companies, as well as governmental agencies commonly use large multi-modular complexes to serve their interim administrative and operational space needs. Modulars offer customers quick, cost-effective space solutions while conserving their capital.  The Company’s corporate offices, and California, Texas, Florida and Georgia regional sales and inventory center offices are housed in various sizes of modular units.
 Since most of Mobile Modular’s customer requirements are to fill temporary space needs, Mobile Modular’s marketing emphasis is on rentals rather than sales. Mobile Modular attracts customers through its website at www.mobilemodular.com, internet advertising and direct marketing.  Customers are encouraged to visit a regional sales and inventory center to view different models on display and to see a regional office, which is a working example of a modular application.
 Because service is a major competitive factor in the rental of modulars, Mobile Modular offers quick response to requests for information, assistance in the choice of a suitable size and floor plan, in-house customization services, rapid delivery, timely installation and field service of its units.  On Mobile Modular’s website, customers are able to view and select inventory for quotation and request in-field service.
 Rentals
 Rental periods range from one month to several years with a typical initial contract term between twelve and twenty-four months. In general, monthly rental rates are determined by a number of factors including length of term, market demand, product availability and product type.  Upon expiration of the initial term, or any extensions, rental rates are reviewed, and when appropriate, are adjusted based on current market conditions.  Most rental agreements are operating leases that provide no purchase options, and when a rental agreement does provide the customer with a purchase option, it is generally on terms management believes to be attractive to Mobile Modular.
 The customer is responsible for obtaining the necessary use permits and for the costs of insuring the unit, and is financially responsible for transporting the unit to the site, preparation of the site, installation of the unit, dismantle and return delivery of the unit to Mobile Modular, and certain costs for customization.  Mobile Modular maintains the units in good working condition while on rent.  Upon return, the units are inspected for damage and customers are billed for items considered beyond normal wear and tear.  Generally, the units are then repaired for subsequent use.  Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and can include floor repairs, roof maintenance, cleaning, painting and other cosmetic repairs. The costs of major refurbishment of equipment are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment.
 -5-


At December 31, 2018, Mobile Modular owned 53,035 new or previously rented modulars and portable storage containers with an aggregate cost of $817,375 million including accessories, or an average cost per unit of $15,411.  Utilization is calculated at the end of each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment.  At December 31, 2018, fleet utilization was 79.3% and average fleet utilization during 2018 was 78.2%.  The Mobile Modular segment includes the results of operations of Mobile Modular Portable Storage, which represented approximately 8% of the Company’s 2018 total revenues.
 Sales
 In addition to operating its rental fleet, Mobile Modular sells modulars to customers.  These sales typically arise out of its marketing efforts for the rental fleet and from existing equipment already on rent.  Such sales can be of either new or used units from the rental fleet, which permits some turnover of older units.  During 2018 Mobile Modular’s largest sale represented approximately 5% of Mobile Modular’s sales, 2% of the Company’s consolidated sales and less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenues.
 Mobile Modular typically provides limited 90-day warranties on used modulars and passes through the manufacturers’ one-year warranty on new units to its customers.  Warranty costs have not been significant to Mobile Modular’s operations to date, and the Company attributes this to its commitment to high quality standards and regular maintenance programs.  However, there can be no assurance that warranty costs will continue to be insignificant to Mobile Modular’s operations in the future.
 Enviroplex manufactures portable classrooms built to the requirements of the California Division of the State Architect (“DSA”) and sells directly to California public school districts and other educational institutions.
 Seasonality
 Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions.
Competition
 Competition in the rental and sale of relocatable modular buildings is intense. Some of our larger national competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Corporation, have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have.  In addition, a number of other smaller companies operate regionally throughout the country.  Mobile Modular operates primarily in California, Texas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C.  Significant competitive factors in the rental business include availability, price, service, reliability, appearance and functionality of the product. Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Part of the Company’s strategy for modulars is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. The Company's facilities and related infrastructure enable it to modify modulars efficiently and cost effectively to meet its customers’ needs. Management's goal is to be more responsive at less expense. Management believes this strategy, together with its emphasis on prompt and efficient customer service, gives Mobile Modular a competitive advantage. Mobile Modular is determined to respond quickly to requests for information, and provide experienced assistance for the first-time user, rapid delivery and timely repair of its modular units. Mobile Modular’s already high level of efficiency and responsiveness continues to improve as the Company upgrades procedures, processes and computer systems that control its internal operations. The Company anticipates intense competition to continue and believes it must continue to improve its products and services to remain competitive in the market for modulars.
Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)
 Mobile Modular and Enviroplex provide classroom and specialty space needs serving public and private schools, colleges and universities.  Within the educational market, the rental (by Mobile Modular) and sale (by Enviroplex and Mobile Modular) of modulars to public school districts for use as portable classrooms, restroom buildings and administrative offices for kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) are a significant portion of the Company’s revenues.   Mobile Modular rents and sells classrooms in California, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.  Enviroplex sells classrooms in the California market. California is Mobile Modular’s largest educational market.  Historically, demand in this market has been fueled by shifting and fluctuating student populations, insufficient funding for new school construction, class size reduction programs, modernization of aging school facilities and the phasing out of portable classrooms no longer compliant with current building codes.  The following table shows the approximate percentages of the Company’s modular rental and sales revenues, and of its consolidated rental and sales revenues for the past five years, that rentals and sales to these schools constitute:

School Facility Funding
 Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, operating budgets, developer fees, various taxes including parcel and sales taxes levied to support school operating budgets, and lottery funds. There is no certainty on the timing of the bond sales and it could take additional years before projects funded by these bonds generate meaningful demand for relocatable classrooms.

ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT
 Description
 TRS-RenTelco rents and sells electronic test equipment nationally and internationally from two facilities located in Grapevine, Texas (the “Dallas facility”) and Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada (the “Montreal facility”).  TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries.  Electronic test equipment revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. The Dallas facility, TRS-RenTelco’s primary operating location, houses the electronic test equipment inventory, sales engineers, calibration laboratories, and operations staff for U.S. and international business. The Montreal facility houses sales engineers and operations staff to serve the Canadian market. As of December 31, 2018, the original cost of electronic test equipment inventory was comprised of 75% general purpose electronic test equipment and 25% communications electronic test equipment.
 Engineers, technicians and scientists utilize general purpose electronic test equipment in developing products, controlling manufacturing processes, completing field service applications and evaluating the performance of their own electrical and electronic equipment. These instruments are rented primarily to aerospace, defense, electronics, industrial, research and semiconductor industries. To date, Keysight Technologies (formerly Agilent Technologies) and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured the majority of TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose electronic test equipment with the remainder acquired from over 60 other manufacturers. 
 Communications test equipment, including fiber optic test equipment, is utilized by technicians, engineers and installation contractors to evaluate voice, data and multimedia communications networks, to install fiber optic cabling, and in the development and manufacturing of transmission, network and wireless products. These instruments are rented primarily to manufacturers of communications equipment and products, electrical and communications installation contractors, field technicians, and service providers. To date, Anritsu and Viavi Solutions (formerly JDS Uniphase Corporation) have manufactured a significant portion of TRS-RenTelco’s communications test equipment, with the remainder acquired from over 40 other manufacturers.
 TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose test equipment rental inventory includes oscilloscopes, amplifiers, analyzers (spectrum, network and logic), signal source and power source test equipment. The communications test equipment rental inventory includes network and transmission test equipment for various fiber, copper and wireless networks. TRS-RenTelco occasionally rents electronic test equipment from other rental companies and re-rents the equipment to customers.
 Competitive Strengths
 Market Leadership - The Company believes that TRS-RenTelco is one of the largest electronic test equipment rental and leasing companies offering a broad and deep selection of general purpose and communications test equipment for rent in North America.
 Expertise - The Company believes that its knowledge of products, technology and applications expertise provides it with a competitive advantage over others in the industry.  Customer requirements are supported by application engineers and technicians that are knowledgeable about the equipment’s uses to ensure the right equipment is selected to meet the customer’s needs. This knowledge can be attributed to the experience of TRS-RenTelco’s management, sales and operational teams.
 Operating Structure - TRS-RenTelco is supported by a centralized distribution and inventory center on the grounds of the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in Texas.  The Company believes that the centralization of servicing all customers in North America and internationally by TRS-RenTelco’s experienced logistics teams provides a competitive advantage by minimizing transaction costs and enabling TRS-RenTelco to ensure customer requirements are met.
 Asset Management - TRS-RenTelco’s rental equipment inventory is serviced by an ISO 9001-2015 registered and compliant calibration laboratory that repairs and calibrates equipment ensuring that off rent equipment is ready to ship immediately to meet customers’ needs.  TRS-RenTelco’s team of technicians, product managers and sales personnel are continuously monitoring and analyzing the utilization of existing products, new technologies, general economic conditions and estimates of customer demand to ensure the right equipment is purchased and sold, at the right point in the equipment’s technology life cycle.  The Company believes this enables it to maximize utilization of equipment and the cash flow generated by the rental and sales revenue of each model of equipment.  TRS-RenTelco strives to maintain strong relationships with equipment manufacturers, which enables it to leverage those relationships to gain rental opportunities.
 -8-


Customer Service - The Company believes that its focus on providing excellent service to its customers provides a competitive advantage.  TRS-RenTelco strives to provide exemplary service to fulfill its commitments to its customers.  TRS-RenTelco prides itself in providing solutions to meet customers’ needs by having equipment available and responding quickly and thoroughly to their requests.  TRS-RenTelco’s sophisticated in-house laboratory ensures the equipment is fully functional and meets its customers’ delivery requirements. Service needs of TRS-RenTelco’s customers are supported 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by its customer care specialists.  TRS-RenTelco’s goal is to provide service beyond its customers’ expectations, which, the Company believes, results in customer loyalty and repeat business.
 Market
 Electronic test equipment rental is a market which we estimate has equipment on rent worldwide or available for rent with an aggregate original cost in excess of $1 billion.  There is a broad customer base for the rental of such instruments, including aerospace, communications, defense, electrical contractor, electronics, industrial, installer contractor, network systems and research companies.
 TRS-RenTelco markets its electronic test equipment throughout the United States, Canada, and, to a limited extent, other countries. TRS-RenTelco attracts customers through its outside sales force, website at www.TRSRenTelco.com, telemarketing program, trade show participation, paid internet search and electronic mail campaigns. A key part of the sales process is TRS-RenTelco’s knowledgeable inside sales engineering team that effectively matches test equipment solutions to meet specific customer’s requirements.
 The Company believes that customers rent electronic test equipment for many reasons. Customers frequently need equipment for short-term projects, to evaluate new products, and for backup to avoid costly downtime.  Delivery times for the purchase of such equipment can be lengthy; thus, renting allows the customer to obtain the equipment expeditiously.  The Company also believes that the relative certainty of rental costs can facilitate cost control and be useful in the bidding of and pass-through of contract costs. Finally, renting rather than purchasing may better satisfy the customer’s budgetary constraints.
 Rentals
 TRS-RenTelco rents electronic test equipment typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer.  Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the current manufacturers’ list price. TRS-RenTelco depreciates its equipment over 1 to 8 years with no residual value.
 At December 31, 2018, TRS-RenTelco had an electronic test equipment rental inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $285.1 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment.  Utilization was 62.1% as of December 31, 2018 and averaged 62.7% during the year.
 Sales
 Profit from equipment sales is a material component of TRS-RenTelco’s overall annual earnings. Gross profit from sales of both used and new equipment over the last five years generally has ranged from approximately 20% to 23% of total annual gross profit for our electronics division. For 2018, gross profit on equipment sales was approximately 23% of total division gross profit. Equipment sales are driven by the turnover of older technology rental equipment, to maintain target utilization at a model number level, and new equipment sales opportunities. In 2018, approximately 19% of the electronic test equipment revenues were derived from sales.  The largest electronic test equipment sale during 2018 represented approximately 5% of electronic test equipment sales, 1% of the Company’s consolidated sales and less than 1% of consolidated revenues. There is intense competition in the sales of electronic test equipment from a world-wide network of test equipment brokers and resellers, legacy rental companies, and equipment manufacturers. We believe the annual world-wide sale of electronic test equipment is in excess of $8.0 billion per year.
Seasonality
 Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February.  These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter.  These factors may impact the quarterly results of each year’s first and fourth quarter.
 -9-


Competition
 The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources, and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. TRS-RenTelco competes with these and other test equipment rental companies on the basis of product availability, price, service and reliability. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face intense competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market.  Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sales at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options.

 Asset Management – The Company believes that Adler Tanks markets a high quality, well-constructed and well-maintained rental product.  The Company depreciates its tanks and boxes over a 20 year estimated useful life to 0% residual value.  We believe that if maintained, older tanks and boxes will continue to produce similar rental rates as newer equipment.  The fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by understanding key vertical market customer demand, seasonality factors, competitor’s product availability, expected equipment returns and manufacturer’s production capacity.

 Liquid and solid containment equipment rental is a market in the U.S with a large and diverse number of market segments including oil and gas exploration and field services, refinery, chemical and industrial plant maintenance, environmental remediation and field services, infrastructure building construction, marine services, pipeline construction and maintenance, electrical grid transformer maintenance, tank terminals services, wastewater treatment, and waste management and landfill services.
 The tank and box rental products that Adler Tanks builds may be utilized throughout the U.S. and are not subject to any local or regional construction code or approval standards.
 Rentals
 Adler Tanks rents tanks and boxes typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer.  Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the equipment’s original acquisition cost.  At December 31, 2018, Adler Tanks had rental equipment inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $313.6 million.  Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment.  Utilization was 56.4% at December 31, 2018 and averaged 59.9% during the year.

Seasonality
 Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February.  These months may have lower rental activity due to inclement weather in certain regions of the country impacting the industries that we serve.
Competition
 The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive including national, regional and local companies.  Some of our national competitors, notably BakerCorp (acquired by United Rentals in July 2018), Rain For Rent and Mobile Mini, may be larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources than we have.  Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories, lower cost basis of rental equipment, lower cost structures and more established relationships with equipment manufacturers than we have.  In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do.  As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract and retain customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates.  Adler Tanks competes with these companies based upon product availability, product quality, price, service and reliability.  We may encounter increased competition in the markets that we serve from existing competitors or from new market entrants in the future.
