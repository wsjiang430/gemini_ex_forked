  ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  Overview
  
 Loop Industries, Inc. is a technology and licensing company whose mission is to accelerate the world’s shift toward sustainable plastic and away from our dependence on fossil fuels. Loop owns patented and proprietary technology that depolymerizes no and low value waste PET plastic and polyester fiber, including plastic bottles and packaging, carpet and polyester textile of any color, transparency or condition and even ocean plastics that have been degraded by the sun and salt, to its base building blocks (monomers).  The monomers are filtered, purified and repolymerized to create virgin-quality Loop™ branded PET plastic resin and polyester fiber suitable for use in food-grade packaging to be sold to consumer goods companies to help them meet their sustainability objectives.  Through our customers and production partners, Loop is leading a global movement toward a circular economy by commercializing a leading-edge technology which will ensure plastic stays in the economy for a more sustainable future for all.
 Industry Background
  
  We believe there is an increasing demand for action to address the global plastic crisis, which has been characterized by facts provided by leading academic and not-for profit organizations. For example, the University of Georgia reports eight million metric tons of plastic waste flows into our shared oceans every year, and, according to The New Plastics Economy, by 2050 more plastic waste is expected to be present in the ocean than fish (by mass). Couple this information with the global annual market demand for PET plastic and polyester fiber at nearly $130 billion, and the current growth projections from the 2018 IHS Polymer Market Report indicating this will exceed $160 billion by 2022, and the need for governments and consumer brands to take decisive action to stem this global plastic crisis becomes readily apparent.
  
  Examples of actions and trends of 2018 and early 2019 that demonstrate the significance of the plastic crisis:
  
   ●
 The United Kingdom has proposed a regulation expected to impose a tax on plastic packaging imported or manufactured in the United Kingdom that does not contain at least 30% recycled content. This compliments the proposed reform of the producer responsibility regime for packaging throughout the United Kingdom; and tools to increase the recycling of municipal waste from households and businesses in England;

 
   ●
 The proposed European Union Directive on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment is expected to require that single-use PET plastic bottles contain 25% recycled content by 2025 and 30% by 2030;

 
   ●
 France has proposed to increase the price of single-use plastic containers that use virgin PET plastic by up to 10% in an effort to discourage consumers from buying packaging that does not contain recycled content;

 
   ●
 Plastic pollution continues to be one of the most persistently covered environmental issues by media and local and global environmental non-governmental organizations; and

 
   ●
 Global consumer goods companies have made significant commitments to make the transition to a circular plastic economy, namely:

 
   i.
 In January 2018, Danone’s evian® brand bottled spring water committed to a 100% recycled content package by 2025;

   ii.
 In 2018, Coca-Cola committed to an average recycled content of 50% across its plastic packaging by 2030;

   iii.
 In October 2018, PepsiCo committed to an average recycled content of 33% in its packaging by 2025;

   iv.
 In December 2018, Nestle Waters committed that its plastic packaging will contain 50% recycled content by 2025; and

   v.
 In February 2019, the L’OCCITANE Group, a global manufacturer and retailer of natural cosmetics, committed to a 100% recycled content package by 2025.

 
  We believe these trends indicate that the transformation from a linear to a circular plastic economy is not only necessary and inevitable, but underway. And that this transition is leading to a substantial demand for sustainable, cost-effective, marketable Loop™ PET plastic resin and polyester fiber.

  Our Technology
  
  The power of our technology lies in its ability to divert and recover what is currently considered plastic waste from landfills, rivers, oceans and natural areas for use as feedstock to create new, sustainable, infinitely recyclable Loop™ PET plastic resin and polyester fiber. We believe our technology can deliver a cost-effective and profitable virgin quality PET plastic resin suitable for use in food-grade packaging.
  
  Our Generation I technology process yielded polyethylene terephthalate (“PTA”) and monoethylene glycol (“MEG”), two common monomers of PET plastic, through depolymerization. While monomers were of excellent purity and strong yield, we continued to challenge ourselves to drive down cost and eliminate inputs. It was during this process that we realized we could eliminate water and chlorinated solvents from the purification process, reduce the number of reagents from five to two and reduce the number of purification steps from 12 to four, if we shifted from the production of PTA to the production of dimethyl terephthalate (“DMT”), another proven monomer of PET plastic that is far simpler to purify. Since June 2018, when we transitioned to our Generation II technology and our newly built industrial pilot plant, we continue to see consistently high monomer yields, excellent purity and improved conversion costs
  
  This shift, from producing the monomer PTA to the monomer DMT was a pivotal moment for Loop. The Generation II technology is more cost-effective, easier to commercialize, more economical for our customers and requires less energy and fewer resource inputs than conventional PET production processes. We believe it to be one of the most environmentally sustainable methods for producing virgin quality food-grade PET plastic in the world.
  
  To protect our technology, and in addition to the patents we hold for our Generation I (or “GEN I”) technology, we have patents pending for our Generation II (or “GEN II”) technology in various jurisdictions around the world. On April 9, 2019, the GEN II U.S. patent was formally approved and issued. Freedom to Operate searches have also been conducted that indicate no conflicts with any of our existing patents or applications and we adhere to rigorous internal data and confidentiality controls.
  
  Commercialization Progress
  
  During the year ended February 28, 2019, we continued executing our corporate strategy where Loop focused on developing three major streams of revenue. These revenue streams are expected to be from the sale of Loop™ PET plastic resin and polyester fiber to customers from our joint venture with Indorama Ventures Limited (“IVL”), license fees from our Waste-to-Resin (“WtR™”) facilities and development fees from the sale and construction of WtR™ facilities around the world.
  
  In September 2018, in connection with the first of these streams, we announced a joint venture with IVL to manufacture and commercialize sustainable Loop™ branded PET plastic resin and polyester fiber to meet the growing global demand from beverage and consumer packaged goods companies. The joint venture agreement details the establishment of a 20,700 metric tonnes facility in the southeastern United States. As the 20,700 metric tonnes production capacity is fully subscribed by customers. which include Danone, PepsiCo, and Coca-Cola’s Cross Enterprise Procurement Group, the joint venture is evaluating increasing the capacity of the facility. The facility is expected to commence production in the second half of the calendar year 2020.
  
  Also, in the 2019 fiscal year, we secured key partners such as Thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions(“tkIS”), built our brand and continued to secure the feedstock needed to support our commercial success.
  
  Production
  
  There are two principal modes planned for commercializing production of Loop™ branded PET plastic resin and polyester fiber. These include the retrofit of existing PET production facilities and the development of greenfield integrated WtR™ facilities around the world, which are described here.
  
  In September of 2018, we announced a joint venture with IVL to manufacture and commercialize sustainable Loop™ branded PET plastic resin and polyester fiber to meet the growing global demand from beverage and consumer packaged goods companies. The 50/50 joint venture has an exclusive world-wide license to use our technology to retrofit existing IVL facilities, so each can produce 100% sustainable Loop™ PET plastic resin and polyester fiber. The first facility, in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is anticipated to begin commercial production in the second half of the calendar year 2020 and is expected to produce 20,700 metric tonnes of sustainable Loop™ PET plastic resin and is fully subscribed by leading global consumer brands.

  As part of the joint venture agreement, the Company anticipates contributing equity to meet its financial obligations under the joint venture agreement with IVL. As at May 2, 2019, the Company has contributed $500,000 to the joint venture. Also, due to increasing market demand from existing and potential customers, and the positive work on the preliminary engineering conducted at the facility, the joint venture is evaluating options to increase the capacity at the plant to 40,000 metric tonnes and the Company anticipates a decision to be made by the second quarter of the fiscal year 2020. If the joint venture decides to expand production capacity, this would increase the Company’s required equity contribution to the joint venture. The Company expects that the additional capacity will be sold to existing and new customers that are currently under negotiation.
  
  We are also in the process of identifying additional facilities suitable for retrofit. The partnership with IVL, which we believe to be one of the world’s largest global integrated PET plastic resin manufacturer, helps bring Loop™ PET sustainable plastic resin and polyester fiber to market more quickly and further emboldens the confidence of our customers to sign multi-year supply agreements and term sheets with us.
  
  To drive our WtR™ solution, which is a key pillar of our commercialization blueprint, December 2018 saw us enter into a Global Alliance Agreement with Thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions (“tkIS”) aimed at transforming the future of sustainable PET plastic resin manufacturing by combining our breakthrough depolymerization technology with tkIS’s PET Melt-To-Resin® technology. As one of the world’s leading PET and polyester engineering companies, we believe tkIS is perfectly positioned to help us commercialize our WtR™ solution—a fully integrated and reimagined manufacturing facility for sustainable Loop™ PET plastic resin and polyester fiber.
  
  We believe the WtR™ solution will result in a highly scalable recurring revenue licensing model to supply the global demand for 100% sustainable Loop™ PET plastic resin and polyester fiber, allowing us to rapidly penetrate and transform the plastic market and fully capitalize on our disruptive potential to be the leader in the circular economy for PET plastic. This fundamentally changes where and how PET plastic resin production occurs—no longer does PET plastic resin production need to be bound to fossil fuels and fossil fuel infrastructure. WtR™ facilities could be located near large urban centers where feedstock is located, and transportation and logistics costs could be significantly reduced as the distance between feedstock, manufacturing and customer use is collapsed.
  
  We believe the proposition for those seeking a turnkey solution to manufacture Loop™ PET plastic resin and polyester fiber, such as chemical companies, waste managers, existing recyclers and even consumer good companies around the world is compelling. We further believe this will create a recurring licensing revenue stream for us while expanding the capacity of Loop™ PET plastic resin and polyester fiber in the marketplace to meet the substantial demand from consumer goods companies.

  Supply Agreements with Global Consumer Brands
  
  Consumer brands are seeking a solution to their plastic challenge and they are taking bold action. In the past year we have seen major brands make significant commitments to close the loop on their plastic packaging in two ways, by transitioning their packaging to recyclable materials and by incorporating more recycled content into their packaging. We believe Loop™ PET plastic resin and polyester fiber provides the ideal solution for these brands because Loop™ PET plastic resin and polyester fiber is recyclable and contains 100% recycled PET and polyester fiber content with virgin quality suitable for use in food-grade packaging. That means consumer packaged goods companies can now market packaging made from a 100% Loop™ branded PET plastic resin and polyester fiber.
  
  As a result, in the 2019 Fiscal year, we delivered a significant number of announcements with some of the world’s leading brands, including:
  
   ●
 Multi-year supply agreement with Danone SA, one of the world’s leading global food and beverage companies. Danone will purchase 100% sustainable and upcycled Loop™ branded PET from Loop’s joint venture facility with IVL in the United States for use in brands across its portfolio including evian®, Danone’s iconic natural spring water;

 
   ●
 Multi-year supply agreement with PepsiCo, one of the largest purchasers of recycled PET plastic, enabling them to purchase production capacity from Loop’s joint venture facility with IVL in the United States and incorporate Loop™ PET plastic resin into its product packaging by 2020;

 
   ●
 Multi-year supply framework with the Coca-Cola system’s Cross Enterprise Procurement Group to supply 100% recycled and sustainable Loop™ PET plastic resin from our joint venture facility with IVL in the United States to authorized Coca-Cola bottlers who enter into supply agreements with us;

 
   ●
 Multi-year supply agreement with L’Occitane to supply 100% recycled and sustainable Loop™ PET plastic resin from our first European production facility;

 
   ●
 A new program, free to consumers of Gatorade Gx and Drinkfinity, subsidiaries of PepsiCo, to return used Gatorade Gx and Drinkfinity pods to Loop where the PET from the pods will be processed using Loop’s technology to make Loop™ PET plastic resin and polyester fiber, and all other recyclable components are sent for recycling;

 
   ●
 A new program, free to consumers of Drinkworks by Keurig®, to return used Drinkworks pods to Loop where the PET from the pods will be processed using Loop’s technology to make Loop™ PET plastic resin and polyester fiber and all other recyclable components are sent for recycling;

 
   ●
 Letter of Intent with L’Oréal Group, the global leader in the beauty industry setting the stage for L’Oréal to work towards becoming the first major cosmetics company in the world to close the loop on their PET plastic packaging by incorporating Loop™ PET; and

 
   ●
 Letter of Intent with Nestle Waters North America setting forth the framework conditions for a multi-year supply agreement for Loop™ PET.

 
  Loop believes that due to the commitments by large global consumer brands to incorporate more recycled content into their product packaging, the regulatory requirements for minimum recycled content in packaging imposed by governments, the virgin-like quality of Loop™ branded PET and the marketability of Loop™ PET to extoll the sustainability credentials of consumer brands that incorporate Loop™ PET, it will sell its Loop™ branded PET at a premium price relative to virgin PET.

  Turning Waste into Feedstock
  
  To us, waste PET plastic and polyester fiber is feedstock, the materials introduced into our Generation II depolymerization technology to yield PET monomers. Our technology can use plastic bottles and packaging of any color, transparency or condition, carpet, clothing and other polyester textiles that may contain colors, dyes or additives, and even ocean plastics that have been degraded by sun and salt. This is yet another distinct advantage of Loop™ PET over mechanically recycled PET, our ability to use materials that nearly all other recyclers do not use. This also means we are creating a new market for materials that have persistently been leaking out of the waste management system and into our shared rivers, oceans and natural areas.
  
  We have a dedicated team studying the availability of feedstock to ensure each planned facility can operate continuously. The team has already identified the sources required for our first joint venture facility with IVL and is now focused on signing supply agreements to secure this feedstock for the long term.
  
  The team is also conducting a macro-to-micro analysis in the United States, Canada, European Union and Asia to help us evaluate the size and location of our next facilities. The approach includes a fulsome inventory of PET materials introduced into a region, the materials collected (or recycled) in the region and the material loss, or the difference between the material introduced and the material collected. This allows us to identify not only the material traditionally available for recycling, but how material can be effectively diverted from landfill, rivers, oceans and natural areas by providing a new outlet for what was formerly considered waste.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
 We rely on a combination of patent and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our patents, brand names, product designs and marks.
  
 We have two patent groups, referred to as GEN I technology and the GEN II technology, with claims relating to our proprietary technology for depolymerization of PET.
  
   ●
 The GEN I portfolio has two issued U.S. patents and a pending U.S. application expected to expire on or around July 2035. Internationally, we also have an issued patent in Taiwan, an allowed application in the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and pending patent applications in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, and South Africa, all expected to expire on or around July 2036 if granted.

 
   ●
 The GEN II technology portfolio has an issued U.S. patent and a pending U.S. application expected to expire on or around September 2037; as well as a PCT application and non-PCT applications in Argentina, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Bhutan, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Iraq, Pakistan, Taiwan, Uruguay, and Venezuela, all expected to expire on or around September 2037 if granted. Additionally, we have three pending provisional applications directed to additional aspects of the GEN II technology. Any patents that would ultimately grant from these provisional applications would be expected to expire no earlier than 2039, if granted.

 
  Government Regulation and Approvals
  
 As we seek to further develop and commercialize our business, we will be subject to extensive and frequently developing federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations. Compliance with current and future regulations could increase our operational costs.
  
 Our operations require various governmental permits and approvals. We are in the process of obtaining all necessary permits and approvals for the operation of our business; however, any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits and approvals or to have the necessary approvals in place may adversely affect our operations and may subject us to penalties.
  
  The use of mechanically recycled PET for food grade applications in India is not permitted, and in Japan and China it is highly inadvisable for a variety of reasons including the perception of contamination from mechanically recycled sources. We believe that means that Loop™ PET plastic resin and polyester fiber has a distinct advantage in these markets, which represent nearly three billion people or approximately 38% of the global population. Since our product is not mechanically recycled PET, we expect that demand from PET manufacturers and global consumer goods companies in these regions for 100% Loop™ branded PET plastic resin and polyester fiber will be a significant part of our strategy going forward.

  Employees
  
 As at May 2, 2019, we have 34 employees, 33 of which are located in Terrebonne, Quebec, Canada and one located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 Corporate History
  
 We were originally incorporated in Nevada in March 2010 under the name Radikal Phones Inc., which was changed to First American Group Inc. in October 2010. On June 29, 2015, we completed a reverse acquisition of Loop Holdings, Inc. (“Loop Holdings”) whereby we acquired all of Loop Holdings’ issued and outstanding shares of common stock in a share exchange for approximately 78.1% of the capital stock of our Company at the time. The depolymerization business of Loop Holdings became our sole operating business. On June 22, 2015, our board of directors approved a change in the fiscal year end date from September 30 to the last day of February. On
  July 21, 2015, we changed our name to Loop Industries, Inc.
  
 Loop Holdings was originally incorporated in Nevada on October 23, 2014. The depolymerization technology underlying our business was originally developed by Hatem Essaddam who sold the technology and related intellectual property rights to Loop Holdings in October 2014, pursuant to an Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement dated October 27, 2014, by and among Hatem Essaddam, Loop Holdings, and Daniel Solomita. The intellectual property acquired pursuant to such Intellectual Property Agreement formed the basis for establishing the GEN I technology that was initially used by the Company. The GEN I technology has now been superseded by the development of the Company’s GEN II technology, which forms the basis for our commercialization into the future. We do not intend to commercialize our GEN I technology.
  
 On May 24, 2016, 9449507 Canada Inc. was organized under the federal laws of Canada and on November 11, 2016 became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Loop Industries, Inc. following the transfer by Mr. Solomita of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of 9449507 Canada Inc. to Loop Industries, Inc. On December 23, 2016,
  9449507 Canada Inc. changed its legal name to Loop Canada Inc.
  
 On December 31, 2016, 8198381 Canada Inc. entered into a purchase and sale agreement to transfer to Loop Canada Inc., all assets and liabilities it held pertaining to our business of depolymerizing plastics, including employees and operations.
  
 On March 9, 2017, Loop Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into Loop Industries, Inc., with Loop Industries, Inc. being the surviving entity as a result of the merger.
  
 On November 20, 2017, Loop Industries, Inc. commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under its new trading symbol, “LOOP.” From April 10, 2017 to November 19, 2017, our common stock was quoted on the OTCQX tier of the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol “LLPP.” From October 29, 2015 through April 7, 2017, our common stock was quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the stock symbol “LLPP.” From September 26, 2012 to October 28, 2015, our common stock was quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the stock symbol “FAMG.”
