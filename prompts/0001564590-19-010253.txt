Overview
 We are a clinical stage drug discovery, development and manufacturing company focused on deploying our proprietary integrated cell-free protein synthesis platform, XpressCF™, to create a broad variety of optimally designed, next-generation protein therapeutics initially for cancer and autoimmune disorders. We aim to design therapeutics using the most relevant and potent modalities, including cytokine-based targets, immuno-oncology, or I/O agents, antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, and bispecific antibodies that are directed primarily against clinically validated targets where the current standard of care is suboptimal. We believe our platform allows us to accelerate the discovery and development of potential first-in-class and best-in-class molecules by enabling the rapid and systematic evaluation of protein structure-activity relationships to create optimized homogeneous product candidates. Our mission is to transform the lives of patients by using our XpressCF™ Platform to create medicines with improved therapeutic profiles for areas of unmet need. 
 Our two most advanced product candidates are wholly owned: STRO-001, an ADC directed against CD74, for patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, and STRO-002, an ADC directed against
 folate receptor-alpha, or FolRα, for patients with ovarian and endometrial cancers. STRO-001 is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1 trial, with initial safety data expected in mid-2019 and initial efficacy data expected by year end 2019. In October 2018, we were granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA, for STRO-001 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We began enrolling patients in a STRO-002 Phase 1 trial focused on ovarian and endometrial cancers in March 2019, with initial safety data expected by year end 2019.  We have also entered into multi-target, product-focused collaborations with leaders in the field of oncology, including a cytokine derivatives collaboration with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, or Merck, a B Cell Maturation Antigen, or BCMA, and an immuno-oncology directed alliance with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, and an oncology-focused collaboration with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (operating in the United States and Canada under the name “EMD Serono”). 
 We believe our XpressCF™ platform is the first and only current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, compliant and scalable cell-free protein synthesis technology that has resulted in product candidates in clinical development. We believe key advantages of our cell-free protein synthesis platform over conventional biologic drug discovery and development include: 
  
• | ability to rapidly produce a wide variety of protein structures in-house;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to incorporate multiple, different non-natural amino acids in a single protein;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | faster cycle time;
--+-------------------


• | efficient drug discovery and early pharmacology and safety assessment; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rapid and predictable scalability.
--+-----------------------------------

 We plan to leverage these capabilities to accelerate the discovery and development of potential first-in-class and best-in-class molecules. 
 The benefits of our XpressCF™ Platform have resulted in collaborations with leaders in the field of oncology, including Merck, Celgene and EMD Serono. As a result of discovery efforts enabled through our XpressCF+™ Platform, Merck has the right to develop up to three cytokine derivatives for cancer and autoimmune disorders, with Merck to make a specific payment for the third product candidate. Additionally, Celgene has the worldwide right to develop an anti-cancer ADC and an anti-cancer bispecific antibody, with Celgene to make specific payments to us to obtain such worldwide rights to the second of the two product candidates, and development rights to two additional anti-cancer bispecific antibodies outside of the U.S. The lead candidate in this collaboration is a novel ADC therapeutic directed against BCMA for which an IND submission is expected in the first half of 2019. Under the collaboration with EMD Serono, we are using our XpressCF+™ Platform to discover and develop mono, bispecific or multispecific ADC product candidates against multiple cancer targets. The most advanced candidate in this collaboration is a bispecific ADC that is currently undergoing preclinical studies. To date, we have received in aggregate approximately $355 million in payments from all of our collaborations, which includes approximately $54 million in investments in our stock. We intend to selectively enter into additional collaborations with partners who are seeking efficient and effective drug discovery, preclinical development and manufacturing capabilities for the creation of novel therapeutics.

Our first internally developed product candidate is STRO-001, which we believe has the potential to be a first-in-class and best-in-class ADC directed against CD74, an antigen that is highly expressed in many B cell malignancies. In multiple preclinical models, STRO-001 has demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity. In addition, the properties of STRO-001 suggest a low likelihood of off-target toxicity and potential for an improved therapeutic index. STRO-001 is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1 trial for multiple myeloma and NHL and we expect initial safety data in mid-2019 and expect initial efficacy data by year end 2019. 
 We are also internally developing STRO-002, an ADC directed against FolRα, initially targeted for the treatment of ovarian and endometrial cancers. Our experiments show that FolRα expression can be detected in 90% or more of ovarian and endometrial cancers. In preclinical models, STRO-002 has demonstrated the potential for enhanced and selective activity against cells expressing FolRα, superior inhibition of tumor growth and greater linker stability, in comparison to experiments we conducted with a benchmark FolRα-targeting molecule. We began enrolling patients in a STRO-002 Phase 1 trial focused on ovarian and endometrial cancers in March 2019, with initial safety data expected by year end 2019. 
 Although we believe our product candidates have the potential to be first-in-class and/or best-in-class and to provide potent anti-tumor activity with reduced off-target toxicity, we will need to complete additional studies to determine the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. The results of these future studies may be different than the results of our earlier studies. We have not received regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, and in order to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies will need to determine that our product candidates are safe and effective. We may not obtain regulatory approval on the timeline we currently expect, or at all, and competing therapies and products may ultimately reach the market faster or have more favorable safety and efficacy profiles than our products candidates. 
 Beyond these wholly owned programs and collaborations, we are developing a broader pipeline of next-generation protein therapeutics using our XpressCF™ Platform. Our protein engineering and chemistry efforts are focused on maximizing therapeutic indices, and our technology allows us to rapidly test our therapeutic hypothesis in significantly more product candidates than conventional protein synthesis allows in order to identify the best molecule to advance to the clinic. Our drug discovery teams are exploring novel immuno-oncology therapies, including cytokine-based therapies. We are also actively pursuing the discovery and development of other novel ADC and bispecific antibodies, including T cell-engager discovery programs. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to use our proprietary XpressCF™ Platform to create cytokine-based immuno-oncology therapeutics, ADCs and bispecific antibodies primarily against clinically validated targets. Key elements of our strategy are to: 

• | Advance STRO-001 and STRO-002 through clinical development. We are currently evaluating STRO-001 in a Phase 1 trial for patients with advanced and/or refractory multiple myeloma and NHL. Based on compelling preclinical data, we believe STRO-001 has the potential to be a first-in-class and best-in-class ADC directed against CD74, which is highly expressed in many B cell malignancies. We expect initial safety data in mid-2019 and expect initial efficacy data by year end 2019. In October 2018, we were granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA, for STRO-001 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We began enrolling patients in a STRO-002 Phase 1 trial focused on ovarian and endometrial cancers in March 2019, with initial safety data expected by year end 2019. Given that FolRα is a clinically validated target for ovarian cancer, along with STRO-002’s homogeneous design, we believe it could be a best-in-class FolRα-targeted ADC and provide greater activity, stability and safety as compared to other investigational agents in development.

• | Develop a diverse pipeline of novel product candidates with optimal therapeutic profiles. We intend to build a broad pipeline of optimally designed, next-generation protein therapeutics for cancer and autoimmune disorders using our XpressCF™ Platform. Our cell-free-based protein synthesis system enables the rapid and systematic evaluation of protein structure-activity relationships, which we believe will accelerate the discovery and development of molecules. We aim to take advantage of the most potent modalities, including cytokines, ADCs and bispecifics, to create drugs that are directed primarily against clinically validated targets where the current standard of care is suboptimal.

• | Strategically pursue additional collaborations to broaden the reach of our XpressCF™ Platform. To maximize the value of our XpressCF™ Platform technology, we have entered into multi-target, product-focused collaborations with leaders in the field of oncology, including a cytokine derivatives collaboration with Merck, a BCMA and immuno-oncology directed alliance with Celgene and an oncology-focused ADC collaboration with EMD Serono. We intend to selectively enter into additional collaborations with partners who are seeking efficient and effective drug discovery and manufacturing capabilities for the development of novel therapeutics. As with some of our current collaborations, we intend to retain certain development and commercial rights to maximize the future potential value of product candidates discovered and developed using our XpressCF™ Platform. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain worldwide rights to our core product candidates. We own the worldwide commercial rights to our lead product candidates, STRO-001 and STRO-002. We have assembled a management team with extensive experience in the biopharmaceutical industry, including drug discovery and development through commercialization, and our plan is to independently pursue the development and commercialization of our product candidates. As we continue to advance our products, we may opportunistically pursue strategic partnerships that maximize the value of our pipeline. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively expand the scope of our XpressCF™ Platform into other therapeutic areas. Due to the versatility of our platform, we can explore additional therapeutic areas outside of oncology, such as autoimmune diseases. We intend to make further investment in the development of our XpressCF™ Platform to expand our pipeline of product candidates.

Cancer Remains a Major Unmet Medical Need 
 Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the United States, accounting for nearly one in every four deaths. Approximately 40% of Americans will develop cancer and, according to the American Cancer Society, there will be 1.8 million new cases of cancer and 607,000 deaths due to cancer in the United States in 2019.
Traditional Cancer Therapeutics 
 Cancer treatment has traditionally included chemotherapy, radiation, surgery or a combination of these approaches. Chemotherapy agents and other small molecule targeted therapies can be effective in certain types of cancer, but they can also cause toxicities that may lead to life-threatening consequences, lower quality of life or untimely termination of treatment. Furthermore, these agents offer limited efficacy in many types of cancer. 
 Over the last twenty years, new paradigms of cancer research and treatment have emerged to address the limitations of existing treatments. Some of the most promising new approaches involve biologic therapies, including monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that bind to antigen targets on tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth, or block processes that provide nourishment for the tumor. As a drug class, monoclonal antibodies have transformed the treatment of oncology and represent some of the top selling therapies on the market. For example, Roche’s Avastin, Rituxan/CD20, and Herceptin/HER-2 franchises dominated the market with over $23 billion in combined 2018 annual sales.
 Despite the success of conventional monoclonal antibodies, they still have limitations. For example, the response seen with monoclonal antibodies can be variable, with some patients responding, while others do not. In addition, the response is often not durable and many patients relapse or become refractory to treatment. Also, safety and tolerability concerns often limit the use of higher, potentially more efficacious doses. We believe our XpressCF™ Platform will provide enhanced therapeutic approaches for treating cancer to address these unmet needs. A new generation of biologics is emerging, including immuno-oncology agents, ADCs and bispecific antibodies. The expectation is that multiple therapeutic modalities will be used in novel combinations to treat patients and provide the most potent anti-cancer effect. 
 Immuno-Oncology 
 The immune system is capable of recognizing and eliminating tumor cells. However, some cancer cells over express proteins, called immune checkpoints, which suppress the immune system, and enable the tumor cells to evade destruction. Immuno-oncology has emerged as a promising new therapeutic approach that aims to enhance anti-tumor immune responses by using monoclonal antibodies to overcome these immune checkpoint blockades.

Monoclonal antibody immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as Opdivo, Keytruda and Yervoy, have been approved for the treatment of a number of cancer indications such as, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, renal cancer and bladder cancer. The 2018 combined sales of these three checkpoint inhibitors are projected to be $16 billion and by 2022, forecasted sales are projected to exceed $27 billion.
 Limitations to Current Immuno-Oncology Approaches 
 The effectiveness of any cancer immunotherapy is dependent on the status of an individual patient’s immune system. While many single-agent immunotherapies have resulted in remarkable clinical results, only a minority of patients have realized durable benefits from these treatments. An immunotherapy cannot succeed if a patient’s immune cells are too impaired to benefit from a particular checkpoint inhibitor or cytokine-based therapeutic. As a result, combination therapies have been explored clinically and are designed to provide an additional boost to revive a patient’s ability to mount an immune response against their tumor. However, combination therapies will likely have to provide a significant risk-benefit advantage in order to justify the cumulative costs of combining two separate immunotherapies. New single agent approaches to achieving combinatorial stimulation of a patient’s immune system may therefore create the preferred option for many patients and physicians. 
 Antibody-Drug Conjugates 
 After two decades of industry efforts, several new modalities of highly potent monoclonal antibody-based therapies have emerged, including ADCs. The key components of ADCs include an antibody, a stable linker and a cytotoxic agent (warhead). The antibody is used to target and deliver the cytotoxic agent to tumor cells. ADCs can be mono, bispecific or multi-specific. The intended result of this powerful and targeted approach is greater tumor cell death and less systemic tolerability issues as compared to traditional chemotherapy. The following diagram shows the component parts of an ADC. 
 

Currently, there are more than 100 ADCs being explored in clinical development. Kadcyla and Adcetris are ADCs that have been approved for the treatment of specific subsets of breast cancer and lymphoma, respectively. In the second half of 2017, Besponsa and Mylotarg were approved for the treatment of specific subsets of leukemia. All four of these newly approved therapies demonstrate that ADCs have an emerging role in the armamentarium of cancer therapeutics.

Limitations to Current ADC Approaches 
 Despite the approvals of these ADCs, there have been challenges in achieving the full clinical potential of this modality. We believe these challenges are directly related to the following: 
  
• | Heterogeneity as a Result of Imprecise and Variable Conjugation. The approved ADCs and many that are in development use imprecise technologies that opportunistically attach the cytotoxic payload to naturally occurring amino acids within the antibody and result in a heterogeneous mixture. In these mixtures, the number and site location of the linker-warhead can vary significantly from antibody to antibody within the single ADC product. These many different forms in the final product are likely to perform differently, with some forms carrying insufficient cytotoxin to kill the tumor, and some forms carrying too high a load resulting in unintended toxicities. The overall performance of the heterogeneous ADC is therefore the average activity of the different species within the ADC mixture, which may limit both efficacy and tolerability. For these reasons, we believe this current class of ADCs, which are heterogeneous mixtures, are suboptimal for effective cancer treatment. The figure below compares homogeneous and heterogeneous ADCs. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Suboptimal Linker-Warhead Positioning. Conventional ADC technologies use conjugation chemistry to attach linker-warheads to naturally occurring amino acids within an antibody; therefore, the position is dictated by the pre-existing amino acid sequence. Published research studies have demonstrated that linker-warhead positioning along an antibody can have significant effect on the ability of an ADC to kill tumor cells, with some positions resulting in suboptimal killing. This position effect also contributes to the challenge of a heterogeneous ADC mixture. We believe that superior ADCs can be developed using technologies that allow linker-warhead positioning to be fine-tuned to empirically determined sites for maximal therapeutic benefit. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Instability Due to Linker Design. One of the major challenges in ADC technology has been to develop linking chemistries that ensure that warheads are only released from the antibody within a tumor cell, and not released within the blood or healthy tissue as the ADC is delivered systemically and travels through the body. We believe that safer ADCs can be developed by utilizing non-natural amino acids that enable state-of-the-art chemistries to ensure that the warhead is not prematurely released.

Bispecific Antibodies 
 Bispecific antibodies are engineered proteins that can simultaneously bind to two different types of antigens. Targeting two individual antigens simultaneously is expected to drive a larger clinical impact than conventional monoclonal antibodies. As a class, bispecific antibodies are projected to have potential sales on a worldwide basis of up to $4.4 billion by 2023 and over 40 molecules are currently in clinical development. Bispecific antibodies can be engineered in a variety of different formats as shown below. 
 

Bispecific antibodies come in a wide variety of structural formats that can be used in multiple therapeutic modalities, including dual blocking bispecific antibodies, T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies and dual antigen targeting bispecific antibodies. Given the potential synergistic nature of these approaches, they have the potential to provide a similar, if not improved, therapeutic benefit as compared to a traditional combination approach. In addition, they may also demonstrate an improved safety and tolerability profile. These characteristics could allow for a wider therapeutic index as compared to the comparable combination therapy approach. Additionally, combining two mechanisms in a single bispecific antibody could have advantages in manufacturing, clinical development and patient convenience. 
 Limitations to Current Bispecific Antibody Approaches 
 Bispecific antibodies are highly engineered proteins with structural features not found in nature. The generation of these molecules therefore presents significant design and development challenges especially when using conventional cell-based technologies. These challenges include: 

• | Optimization Challenges. Bispecific antibodies simultaneously engage two different targets and therefore have precise requirements for the binding properties and spatial orientation of each domain in order to have pharmacologic activity. Combinatorial pairing of antibody binding arms to identify an optimized bispecific antibody requires many distinct cell lines that must be engineered during the discovery process, a cumbersome process when using conventional cell-based technologies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Challenges to T Cell-Engagers. Discovery of bispecific T cell-engagers is further limited by the challenge of designing bispecific pairs that can safely activate T cells specifically in the tumor environment without activating peripheral T cells, which would result in severe toxicities. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Difficulties in Protein Expression and Manufacturing. Because bispecific antibodies are highly engineered proteins, conventional cell-based systems have significant difficulties in protein expression, particularly at a larger scale. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that new protein engineering technologies will enable significantly broader design opportunities to discover new bispecific antibodies optimized for therapeutic activity, safety and manufacturability. 
 Cytokine-Based Immuno-Oncology Therapeutics 
 Cytokines are small biologically active proteins that play an essential role in immune cell function. Cytokines are important for cell-to-cell communication and are responsible for controlling immune cell growth and differentiation. Recombinant human cytokines were among the first biotechnology products engineered for therapeutic use, and, in the field of oncology, cytokines that stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells have been viewed as a potential new approach. 
 Certain cytokines play a central role in T cell function, contributing to the careful balance between helpful and harmful immune responses. These can be powerful activators of the immune system but can also suppress immune responses through certain specialized T cells that have suppressive functions. A previously approved cytokine therapeutic Proleukin had shown therapeutic benefit in a small number of cancer patients but its therapeutic use was limited due to toxicity. Scientists at other companies have focused research on finding ways to modify cytokines so as to reduce toxicity while maintaining therapeutic benefit. The observed efficacy of a modified cytokine in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor indicates the potential of this new approach. In light of these data and our prior research into cytokines, we commenced a cytokine-based research program using our XpressCF+™ Platform technology and are now collaborating with Merck on developing cytokine derivatives. We believe that recent advances in immuno-oncology combined with new protein engineering technologies create opportunities to identify novel cytokine-based therapeutics with superior therapeutic indexes. 
 Our Proprietary XpressCF™ Platform 
 While cytokine-based immuno-oncology therapeutics, ADCs and bispecific antibodies hold significant promise, drug developers working with these complex biologics face significant design and development challenges. Optimizing these complex biological structures is a challenging, trial and error process that requires the refinement of several properties in tandem. This iterative process is cumbersome and fraught with significant limitations. As a result, the drug candidate nominated for development is often plagued by inefficient design properties, which then translates to a suboptimal therapeutic index when investigated in the clinic. 
 Our XpressCF™ Platform seeks to address these significant shortcomings. We believe our cell-free-based protein synthesis technology allows for efficient and proper design exploration to be conducted prior to nominating a lead drug candidate. In addition, we believe we can optimally design these types of complex biologics in a manner that is ideal for subsequent production at relevant scale and manufacture. We are the only company with products in clinical development that has the capability to produce cell-free-based protein synthesis at scale. We believe we have a significant advantage over other development approaches in this space. 
 Limitations of Current Cell-Based Synthesis Approaches 
 All existing therapeutic proteins rely on cell-based design, production and manufacturing technologies. The conventional biotechnology approach for the production of these complex biologics relies primarily on CHO cell lines. This first requires low yield transient production from cells that enable characterization of a new protein over several months. This is then followed by development of stable cell lines over several months to a year to enable larger scale preclinical, clinical and commercial production. The characterization process has to be reproduced for every minor variant of the therapeutic protein, which may or may not result in improved properties. Each change requires development of new cell-based methods to generate protein of sufficient quality and quantity to evaluate. Therefore, it is extremely laborious and resource intensive to elucidate principles of structure-activity relationship, and drug discovery is limited by the number of cell lines that can be practically managed in parallel. In addition, they have limited ability to introduce non-natural amino acids into proteins. We believe these limitations hinder the efficiency of drug discovery and often result in suboptimal protein selection. 
 Overview of Our XpressCF™ Platform 
 Our XpressCF™ Platform is fundamentally different from the conventional cell-based protein synthesis approach in that we separate the production of the cell mass from the production of the protein.

--

 

We first generate a cellular mass from our propriety cell line from which we harvest the inner cellular machinery for making proteins. The cellular mass is generated from our highly engineered variant of Escherichia coli, or E.coli bacteria, and has been optimized to make extract that produces complex mammalian proteins. These cells are grown over the course of several days, harvested, broken apart, clarified and stored as a cell mass for future production of our protein therapeutics. We refer to this proprietary cell mass as extract, or XtractCF. The extract includes necessary components for energy production, transcription and translation and can be used to support cell-free protein synthesis. This extract can then be used agnostically to manufacture a wide variety of therapeutic proteins and protein fragments without the need to generate further cell lines. 
 As a result, protein synthesis then becomes a predictable and reproducible biochemical reaction, independent of the constraints of a cell. A specific DNA sequence is added to the extract, which results in the coding and expression of the desired protein in less than 24 hours. Using this process, we express hundreds or thousands of DNA sequences simultaneously within the same cell-free extract system and therefore can make and purify hundreds or thousands of unique proteins at the same time. This allows us to perform rapid expression, testing and characterization of many variants early in discovery to elucidate structure-activity relationships. Structure-activity relationship refers to how changes to the structure of a protein can lead to improvements in a molecule’s properties, such as binding, internalization, functional activity and stability, which are properties that are key to the therapeutic protein’s efficacy and tolerability in the patient. We are thereby able to optimize many properties with high specificity including: binding efficiency to each antigen target, spatial orientation, linker design, target killing efficiency, immunological activity, protein expression and folding efficiency and stability. 
 Advantages of Our XpressCF™ Platform 
 We believe our drug discovery platform provides significant advantages over conventional cell-based protein synthesis approaches and has the ability to produce a large number of variants during the development stage, while preserving the ability to design and test large families of molecules for optimized efficacy and safety features. As a result, we believe that our drug discovery platform can accelerate time to IND by nine to fifteen months compared to conventional technologies. 
 We believe the advantages of our cell-free-based protein synthesis technology platform include: 
  
• | Ability to Rapidly Produce and Evaluate a Wide Variety of Protein Structures In-house. By decoupling the production of the cell-free extract from the production of the protein, we are able to stockpile large quantities of cell-free extract from which we are able to manufacture a wide variety of proteins without the need to generate individual cell lines, including cytokine-based immuno-oncology therapeutics, ADCs and bispecific antibodies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to Incorporate Non-Natural Amino Acids. Our technology allows for efficient incorporation of a non-natural amino acid in any location in an antibody or protein with high precision and fidelity, which we believe allows for the design of optimized protein conjugates. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Faster Cycle Time. Our ability to produce thousands of protein variants in parallel overnight allows us to rapidly express, test and characterize many variants early in discovery to elucidate structure-activity relationships and identify opportunities for superior therapeutic profiles, as well as new intellectual property. We are therefore able to efficiently optimize many properties with high specificity in parallel. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficient Drug Discovery and Early Pharmacology and Safety Assessment. Our cell-free technology creates the opportunity for accelerated pharmacology and safety assessments during the design and discovery phase of product development. This approach allows us to generate optimized proteins early in our discovery process, which can be transitioned seamlessly to clinical scale production using the same cell-free process. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapid and Predictable Scalability. Our cell-free extract does not need to be modified in any manner as we scale from research to preclinical to clinical to commercial production. This enables us to move more rapidly to the clinic by eliminating master cell banking activities and significantly de-risks scale-up to manufacturing.

Our XpressCF™ Solution for cytokine, ADCs and bispecific antibodies-based drug therapeutics 
 As a result, we believe our technology enables new approaches to cytokine, ADCs and bispecific antibody-based drug discovery, development and manufacturing. Key attributes are: 
  
• | Homogeneous Design. Our XpressCF™ Platform enables precise and specific placement of non-natural amino acids in defined numbers and positions within our engineered proteins. These non-natural amino acids then serve as highly stable attachment sites, also known as conjugation sites, for chemical functional groups. For example, we attach linker-warheads to non-natural amino acids within our antibodies to create single-species, tumor-killing ADCs. Similarly, we attach polyethylene glycol polymers onto non-natural amino acids within our cytokine-based therapeutics to create single-species immunotherapies designed for extended pharmacokinetics and safety. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Experimentally Defined Structure-Activity Relationships. Our cell-free technology enables rational design of protein therapeutics through a rapid, reiterative process that experimentally defines structure-activity relationship for cytokine-based therapeutics, ADCs and bispecific antibodies. This approach allows us to explore a wide variety of structural features and formats in parallel as we optimize therapeutic candidates. For example, the precise location of chemical conjugation sites directly affects the activity of both ADCs and cytokine-based therapeutics. Our proprietary technology is key to our ability to define the best number and positions of non-natural amino acids for conjugation based on: conjugation efficiency; functional activity/pharmacological properties; and pharmacokinetics and safety. This design flexibility is also an important aspect of our discovery approach to other protein therapeutics. For example, we are able to make and directly compare a variety of pairings and structural formats for our immuno-oncology bispecific antibody and bispecific T cell-engager programs. This allows us to identify antibody pairs and formats with the best binding properties, spatial orientations and structural stability to create the optimal balance of therapeutic activity and safety. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapid and Efficient Transition from Discovery to the Clinic. Protein therapeutics can encounter obstacles, or even fail, during the transition from research-grade cell lines to cGMP cell lines appropriate for clinical development and commercialization. Our XpressCF™ Platform can rapidly produce different protein types from a single proprietary extract, which can be scaled for discovery, development and ultimately, we believe, commercialization of cytokine-based immuno-oncology therapeutics, ADCs and bispecific antibodies and bispecific T cell-engagers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Accordingly, we use our XpressCF™ Platform to discover and develop cancer therapeutics by empirically determining the optimum structure-activity relationships for cytokine-based immuno-oncology therapeutics, ADCs, bispecific antibodies, and transitioning those products to cGMP compliant manufacturing. The following chart illustrates the applicability of these attributes across the range of modalities we are developing.

Our Product Candidates 
 STRO-001, an ADC Directed Against the Cancer Target CD74 
 Overview 
 We are developing STRO-001, an optimally designed ADC directed against the cancer target CD74, for multiple myeloma and NHL. STRO-001 was designed and optimized for maximal therapeutic index by placing linker-warheads at specific locations within the antibody using our proprietary XpressCF+™ Platform. STRO-001 is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1 trial and we expect initial safety data in mid-2019 and expect initial efficacy data by year end 2019. 
CD74 Overview and Current Limitations 
 CD74 is a transmembrane glycoprotein, or a protein with an attached sugar that spans the inside and outside of a cell. While normal tissues appear to have minimal CD74 expression levels, CD74 is an important B cell target for multiple myelomas and lymphomas. CD74 is expressed in approximately 90% of B cell cancers, including multiple myeloma and lymphoma. Additionally, in a study conducted with a collaborator, we found that CD74 was highly expressed in 75% to 98% of tissues samples derived from individual patients with a variety of B cell malignancies, as illustrated in the table below.

Comprehensive Immunohistochemistry Study
----------------------------------------
Tumor Subtype | Tissue Samples CD74 Positive / Total | % Positive
Follicular lymphoma | 148 / 151 | 98% 
Multiple myeloma | 101 / 134 | 75% 
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma | 135 / 140 | 96% 
Mantle cell lymphoma | 19 / 21 | 90% 

 
Currently, there are no approved therapeutics that specifically target CD74 for treatment of B cell malignancies. We believe earlier ADCs being developed against the target CD74 were ineffective either because they failed to achieve sufficient killing of malignant B cells or they were unable to achieve a sufficient therapeutic benefit before toxicities limited further dose escalations. 
 B Cell Malignancies Overview and Current Limitations 
 B cell malignancy tumor subtypes include multiple myeloma and NHL, which includes mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, and follicular lymphoma. In the United States alone, there are approximately 100,000 new B cell malignancies cases annually, with a prevalence of more than 600,000 cases. Although several therapeutics have recently been approved for the treatment of specific B cell malignancies, including immunotherapies and targeted kinase inhibitors, unmet need persists. These therapeutics are typically used in combination with other agents to provide the most potent anti-cancer effect. While these new therapies have demonstrated improvements in survival, the majority of these patients ultimately relapse during treatment and some experience a resistance to therapy. 
Our Solution, STRO-001 
 Our first internally developed product candidate is STRO-001, which we believe has the potential to be a first-in-class and best-in-class ADC directed against the cancer target CD74, an antigen that is highly expressed in many B cell malignancies and is an attractive target for an ADC therapeutic, given its rapid internalization by the cell. STRO-001 is an ADC targeting the CD74 protein antigen that was developed using our proprietary XpressCF+™ Platform. STRO-001 is composed of an antibody stably conjugated to a highly potent cytotoxic drug, a maytansinoid derivative, at two specific sites on the antibody using a non-cleavable linker. STRO-001 degrades inside of tumor cells to release very potent intracellular catabolites whose hydrophilic nature results in poor permeability into surrounding cells. We believe this decreases the potential of off-target effect in normal tissues. From a safety perspective, we designed STRO-001 to have an optimal potency to toxicity ratio. We rationally selected a homogeneous ADC with a drug-antibody ratio, or DAR, of two. Heterogeneous ADCs typically have DARs that range from zero to eight, with lower DARs generally being associated with less potency and higher DARs generally being associated with a negative impact on pharmacokinetics and toxicity. We chose a DAR of two after demonstrating that DARs of four or six did not increase the efficacy of STRO-001.

Preclinical Data 
 While additional clinical testing will be needed to determine the safety and efficacy of STRO-001 and to obtain regulatory approval, if ever achieved, STRO-001 has demonstrated potent in vitro cell killing activity across multiple B cell tumor lines. Based on these observations, we have used murine tumor models to determine whether STRO-001 also demonstrates cell killing in vivo. In these models, human tumor cell lines are implanted and allowed to grow in mice to subsequently test the activity of anti-cancer agents. Although these murine models do not address safety, they are commonly used to provide experimental proof-of-concept for anti-cancer activity against different tumor types. For example, in tumor bearing mice, single intravenous doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg STRO-001 significantly extended survival in the MM1S-luc bioluminescent disseminated human multiple myeloma xenograft model as shown below on the right. The figure on the left shows bioluminescence imaging of tumor cells during the first month after dosing. This image shows that while the bioluminescent tumor cells disseminated throughout the body in the vehicle treated mice, the tumor cells were cleared from the STRO-001 treated mice. Furthermore, at the high dose, when their bone marrow was assessed at day 129, of the surviving five out of six animals, all appeared to be tumor-free.

STRO-001 demonstrated similar potent efficacy in a murine xenograft model of human DLBCL, the most common form of NHL. In the study shown below, seven out of seven mice exhibited complete tumor regression with no tumor regrowth 90 days after treatment with a single 10 mg/kg dose of STRO-001. Moderate anti-tumor activity was observed with lower doses of 1 or 3 mg/kg, demonstrating a clear dose-response relationship.

 We also examined the potential for STRO-001 to treat human mantle cell lymphoma in a preclinical murine xenograft model. In the study shown below, mice bearing mantle cell tumors had a mean survival of 81 days. In contrast, 90% to 100% of mice treated with a single dose of 3 or 10 mg/kg STRO-001 survived to the end of the study at day 135. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that STRO-001 has potent anti-tumor activity in three different murine models of human B cell malignancy.

We also investigated the safety of STRO-001 in a toxicology study in non-human primates at several dose levels administered on day 1 and day 15. Hematological toxicity was observed consistent with the known effects of the STRO-001 cytotoxic tubulin inhibitor component. No other drug-related toxicities were observed. Importantly, however, we observed clear evidence of STRO-001 pharmacodynamic activity as demonstrated by dose-dependent B cell ablation and recovery as shown below. 
 

Clinical Development Plan 
 The Phase 1 trial for STRO-001 is an open-label study that will evaluate STRO-001 as a monotherapy for patients with multiple myeloma and NHL. The trial will be conducted in two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion. The primary objectives of the trial are to determine the safety and tolerability profile of STRO-001, determine the recommended Phase 2 dose and interval and evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity. The secondary objectives are to characterize the human pharmacokinetics of STRO-001 and additional safety, tolerability and efficacy measures. 
 Our Phase 1 trial of STRO-001 is enrolling adult patients with advanced and/or refractory multiple myeloma and NHL (including DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma) who are refractory to, or intolerant of, all established therapy known to provide clinical benefit for their condition. Multiple myeloma and NHL patients will be enrolled in two separate dose escalation cohorts, starting initially with an accelerated dose titration design. We estimate that there will be approximately 30 patients in each cohort and treatment is scheduled for days one and fifteen in a 28-day cycle. 
 After the recommended Phase 2 dose level is determined, patients could be enrolled into four dose expansion cohorts (myeloma, DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma) if anti-tumor activity is observed during the dose escalation phase. We may enroll up to 40 patients in each of the four dose expansion cohorts. 
 We submitted our IND for STRO-001 in December 2017 and the first patient was dosed in April 2018. We expect initial safety data from our ongoing Phase 1 trial in mid-2019 and expect initial efficacy data by year end 2019.  In October 2018, we were granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for STRO-001 for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
 STRO-002, an ADC Directed Against the Target Folate Receptor-Alpha (FolRα) 
 Overview 
 We are developing STRO-002, an optimally designed ADC directed against the cancer target FolRα, initially targeted for ovarian and endometrial cancers. STRO-002 was designed and optimized for an improved therapeutic index by placing a precise number of linker-warheads at four specific locations within the antibody using our proprietary XpressCF+™ Platform. We began enrolling patients in a STRO-002 Phase 1 trial focused on ovarian and endometrial cancers in March 2019, with initial safety data expected by year end 2019.

FolRα Overview 
 FolRα is a cell-surface glycoprotein, which is believed to be important for supporting DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cancer cells. FolRα exhibits limited expression and distribution in normal tissues. 
 High levels of FolRα have been found in multiple cancer types, including epithelial ovarian cancer, endometrial adenocarcinoma, triple negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Expression appears to correlate with disease progression in ovarian cancer and continues to be expressed following chemotherapy treatment. 
 In order to better understand FolRα expression, we tested 187 samples in a tissue microarray from ovarian and endometrial cancer patients. The table below shows that more than 90% of ovarian and endometrial cancer tissue samples express FolRα. Furthermore, medium to high levels of expression were observed for 80% of ovarian cancer samples and 78% of endometrial cancer samples. 
 
 
 | FolRα Expression | 
---------------------------------------+------------------+---
Tumor Type | Negative | | | Low | | Medium | High | 
Ovarian Cancer (90 tissue samples) | | 10 | % | | 10 | % | 16 | % | 64 | %
Endometrial Cancer (97 tissue samples) | | 7 | % | | 15 | % | 24 | % | 54 | %

Ovarian Cancer Overview 
 Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of cancer death from gynecologic tumors in the United States, and the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women. In the United States alone, the American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 23,000 new cases of ovarian cancer in 2019, and approximately 14,000 women die of this disease. Given that early stages of the disease cause minimal, nonspecific symptoms or is asymptomatic, 60% of patients with ovarian cancer are diagnosed in an advanced stage, for which the prognosis is poor. Standard pre- or post-operative chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is combination therapy with a platinum compound and a taxane, for example, carboplatin and paclitaxel, which achieves a complete response in between 70% to 80% of patients. Patients refractory or resistant to platinum-based treatments are then treated with a host of additional palliative chemotherapeutic agents, each showing only marginal benefit. This represents a significant unmet need and multiple therapies are being tested in the clinic for treatment of these patients, including PARP inhibitors and PD-1 checkpoint protein inhibitors. 
Endometrial Cancer Overview 
 There is also a significant unmet need in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer. In the United States alone, there are about 60,000 new cases of endometrial cancer annually, and approximately 10,500 patients die of this disease each year. First-line treatment for stage III/IV disease is commonly paclitaxel/carboplatin, with no standard of care or FDA-approved treatment options for recurrent disease. With the lack of available therapies for these patients, long-term survival prospects are poor and novel treatments offering even a modest improvement in progression-free survival or overall survival may be considered for expedited regulatory approval. 
Limitations to Current FolRα -Targeted Therapeutics 
 There have been a number of folate- or FolRα -targeted therapies in development including naked antibodies, small molecule drug conjugates, ADCs and T cell retargeting molecules. The most clinically active agent targeting FolRα to date has been Immunogen’s mirvetuximab soravtansine (IMGN853), an ADC composed of a FolRα -binding antibody linked to the tubulin-disrupting maytansinoid, DM4, via a cleavable linker. 
 Immunogen’s IMGN853 monotherapy showed clinical activity in a Phase 1 trial of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, providing encouraging clinical validation for FolRα-targeting ADCs in this patient population. In early March 2019, Immunogen announced top-line results from its Phase 3 FORWARD I Study evaluating the safety and efficacy of mirvetuximab soravtansine compared to chemotherapy in patients with FRα-positive (with medium and high target expression levels), platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.  The study did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival, or PFS, in either the entire study population or in the pre-specified subset of patients with high FRα expression.

Our Solution, STRO-002 
 STRO-002 is directed against the cancer target FolRα, which is highly expressed in multiple cancer types, including ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. This property, together with the highly restricted expression of FolRα on normal tissues, make FolRα a promising ADC approach. 
 STRO-002 employs a cleavable linker that releases a cytotoxic drug inside of tumor cells, while being stable and resistant to cleavage in general circulation. The cytotoxic drug used is our proprietary hemiasterlin moiety. From a safety perspective, we designed STRO-002 to have the optimal potency to safety ratio. We rationally selected a homogenous ADC with an optimized DAR of four. 
 Based on preclinical findings, we believe our efficient homogeneous design of STRO-002 could provide anti-tumor activity, stability and safety with the potential to minimize off-target damage and improve clinical impact by reducing dose-limiting toxicities. We believe an improved therapeutic index could differentiate STRO-002 from conventional technology for the treatment of ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. To test this, we have created a benchmark FolRα -targeting surrogate molecule based on conventional technology that has a heterogeneous ADC, with a similar DAR utilizing a DM4 linker-warhead. We have tested this benchmark molecule against STRO-002 in multiple preclinical models. However, additional preclinical and clinical testing will be needed to determine the safety and efficacy of STRO-002 and to obtain regulatory approval, if ever. STRO-002 may not ultimately provide a greater therapeutic benefit than the current standard of care. 
 Preclinical Data 
 STRO-002, in comparison with the benchmark molecule that we created, has demonstrated: enhanced in vitro activity on cells expressing FolRα and improved specificity on cells that do not express FolRα; superior inhibition of tumor growth; and greater in vitro and in vivo linker stability. 
 STRO-002 has demonstrated potent in vitro cell killing activity across multiple ovarian cancer tumor cell lines. Based on these observations, we have used murine tumor models to determine whether STRO-002 also demonstrates cell killing in vivo. In these models, human tumor cells are implanted and allowed to grow in mice to subsequently test the activity of anti-cancer agents. Although these murine models do not address safety, they are commonly used to provide experimental proof-of-concept for anti-cancer activity against different tumor types. As shown in the data below, dose-dependent anti-tumor activity was observed in mice implanted with OVCAR3 human ovarian cancer tumor cells. Importantly, this anti-tumor effect was observed in mice bearing large established tumors, with evidence of tumor regression following a single dose of 10 mg/kg STRO-002.

In an effort to better understand the relative activity of our homogeneous STRO-002 molecule, we have performed experiments comparing STRO-002 to a benchmark molecule that we created. STRO-002 and the benchmark molecule have comparable DAR and affinity for FolRα expressing cells; however, the benchmark is made using conventional ADC technology and is therefore a heterogeneous mixture. The data below demonstrates STRO-002 has more potent in vitro cell killing activity compared to the benchmark molecule when tested on cells expressing FolRα. In contrast, STRO-002 has minimal if any activity on cells that do not express FolRα, while the benchmark molecule kills cells even in the absence of FolRα. We believe that the data demonstrate that the homogeneous nature of STRO-002 drives more efficient tumor cell killing with better tolerability for normal tissues. 
 


We used a human ovarian cancer xenograft model to understand the in vivo stability of STRO-002 compared to our benchmark molecule. In this model we tested for free warhead, released from the ADC, in the blood or tumor tissue one, three or seven days after dosing. The data below on the left show that the released, free warhead from STRO-002 is observed in the tumor starting one day after dosing, without evidence of free warhead circulating in the blood at any time point. In contrast, the data on the right shows that free warhead derived from the benchmark molecule can be observed circulating in the blood one day after dosing, which could contribute to unintended toxicities. In other preclinical studies, the free hemiasterlin warhead is cleared rapidly from the circulation. Taken together, we believe that these data demonstrate the stability of STRO-002 in vivo, which we believe will contribute to a superior therapeutic index compared to ADCs made using conventional technology. 
 Murine Tumor Model – Free Warhead in Tumor vs. Blood After Dosing 
 

We examined the safety of STRO-002 in an exploratory toxicology study in non-human primates. Hematological toxicity was observed consistent with the known effects of the STRO-002 cytotoxic tubulin inhibitor component. No other drug-related toxicities were observed and, importantly, there were no observed ocular effects in the non-human primate study.

Clinical Development Plan 
 We began enrolling patients in a STRO-002 Phase 1 trial focused on ovarian and endometrial cancers in March 2019, with initial safety data expected by year end 2019. Our Phase 1 trial for STRO-002 is an open-label study that will evaluate STRO-002 as a monotherapy for patients with ovarian and endometrial cancers. The trial is being conducted in two-parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. The primary objectives of the STRO-002 clinical trial are to determine the safety and tolerability profile, to define the recommended Phase 2 dose level and interval and to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity. Our secondary objectives are to characterize the human pharmacokinetics and additional safety, tolerability and efficacy measures. 
 We intend to seek to enroll adult patients with advanced and/or refractory ovarian cancer initially, for whom no suitable treatment exists. These patients are considered to have incurable disease and need repeated courses of life-prolonging and palliative treatment. We believe that ovarian cancer patients will be enrolled in a dose escalation cohort, with treatment frequency and duration yet to be determined. If anti-tumor activity is observed during the dose escalation phase, we would then plan to enroll patients into two dose expansion cohorts (ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer).
 Additional Discovery Efforts 
 Our technology allows us to rapidly incorporate non-natural amino acids in varying numbers and positions, to identify the best cytokine modification for pharmacological activity, pharmacokinetics and safety. Furthermore, our technology enables rapid preclinical development and transition to cGMP manufacturing, ensuring speed to clinic in a promising field. Our drug discovery teams are exploring novel immuno-oncology therapies, including cytokine-based therapies. 
 We are also actively researching to identify new ADCs to add to our pipeline. We have multiple ADC discovery programs ongoing using our XpressCF+™ Platform. Our protein engineering and chemistry efforts are focused on maximizing therapeutic indices, and our technology allows us to rapidly test our therapeutic hypothesis in significantly more product candidates than conventional protein synthesis allows in order to identify the best molecule to advance to the clinic. 
 Our bispecific antibody drug discovery programs are focused on T cell-engagers. We are using our technology to find the optimum protein structure and T cell-engaging properties to maximize safety and efficacy for this promising class of cancer therapeutics. 
 Collaboration and License Agreements 
 Merck Collaboration 
 In July 2018, we entered into the 2018 Merck Agreement with Merck to jointly develop up to three research programs focusing on cytokine derivatives for cancer and autoimmune disorders. 
 Upon signing the 2018 Merck Agreement, Merck paid us an upfront payment of $60.0 million for the research and development of two target programs, and Merck purchased $20.0 million in Series E redeemable convertible preferred stock from us. Additionally, Merck purchased from us, concurrently with our initial public offering in a private placement, approximately $10.0 million of shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price. Under the 2018 Merck Agreement, we are eligible to receive financial support for our research and development efforts based on an agreed-upon level of full-time equivalent personnel effort and related reimbursement rate, and we are eligible to receive another milestone payment if a third target program is selected.  
 Under the terms of the 2018 Merck Agreement, we are eligible to receive aggregate milestone payments of up to $1.6 billion, assuming the development and sale of all therapeutic candidates and all possible indications identified under the collaboration. If one or more products from each of the target programs are developed for non-oncology or a single indication, we will be eligible for reduced aggregate milestone payments. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from mid-single digit to low teen percentages on the worldwide sales of any commercial products that may result from the collaboration.

The 2018 Merck Agreement expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the later of the expiration of the patents covering products licensed under the 2018 Merck Agreement or ten years after the first commercial sale of a product covered by the 2018 Merck Agreement. Upon expiration, Merck will have a fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable non-exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain of our intellectual property rights. 
 Merck may terminate the 2018 Merck Agreement at any time with 60 days’ prior written notice. Either we or Merck has the right to terminate the 2018 Merck Agreement based on the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. 
 Celgene Collaboration 
 In September 2014, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Celgene, or the 2014 Celgene Agreement, to discover and develop bispecific antibodies and ADCs focused primarily on the field of immuno-oncology, using our proprietary integrated cell-free protein synthesis platform, XpressCF™. Under the 2014 Celgene Agreement, we received upfront payments totaling $95.0 million in September 2014, which included an $11.9 million equity investment, and additional payments totaling $60.0 million. 
 In August 2017, we entered an Amended and Restated Collaboration and License Agreement with Celgene, or the 2017 Celgene Agreement, to refocus our 2014 Celgene Agreement on four programs that are advancing throughout preclinical development, which are: 
  
• | BCMA ADC. The most advanced product candidate under collaboration is a BCMA ADC product candidate, which has been designated as a development candidate by Celgene for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We believe Celgene currently plans to submit an IND for this product candidate in the first half of 2019. We currently own the development and commercial rights in the United States to this BCMA ADC product candidate; however, assuming it is the first development candidate from our 2017 Celgene Agreement to have an active IND in the United States, Celgene will then automatically own worldwide development and commercialization rights to such product. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bispecific Antibodies. The other three product candidates subject to our Celgene collaboration are bispecific antibodies, all of which have been designated as development candidates by Celgene. We currently own the rights to develop and commercialize these product candidates in the United States; however, assuming the second development candidate from our 2017 Celgene Agreement achieves an active IND in the United States, and Celgene makes the required payments to us, then Celgene will automatically own worldwide development and commercialization rights to such second product. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon signing of the 2017 Celgene Agreement, we received an option fee payment of $12.5 million in August 2017 and are eligible to receive a second option fee payment of $12.5 million following the first IND clearance, if any, for one of the four programs, if Celgene desires to maintain its option to acquire the U.S. rights to develop and commercialize a second collaboration program to reach IND status. If Celgene exercises its option to acquire from us U.S. rights to a second collaboration program, it will make an option exercise fee payment to us, the amount of which depends on which program reaches IND status. 
 We have received and will be eligible to receive financial support for research and development services assigned to us by Celgene, based on an agreed-upon level of full-time equivalent personnel effort and related reimbursement rate. 
 Under the terms of the 2017 Celgene Agreement, we are entitled to earn development and regulatory contingent payments for each of the four programs under the collaboration, and royalties on sales of any commercial products that may result from the 2017 Celgene Agreement. Additionally, we received a $10.0 million payment in December 2018 for certain manufacturing activities. For licensed products for which Celgene holds worldwide rights, we are eligible to receive aggregate milestone and option fee payments of up to $295.0 million for certain licensed products and up to $393.7 million for certain other licensed products under the collaboration, if approved in multiple indications, and, depending on the licensed product, tiered royalties ranging from single digit to low teen percentages on worldwide sales of any commercial products that may result from the 2017 Celgene Agreement. Additionally, for licensed products for which Celgene holds ex-U.S. rights, we will also be eligible to receive pre-commercial contingent payments and tiered royalties ranging from mid to high single digit percentages. 
 Celgene may terminate the 2017 Celgene Agreement at any time with 120 days’ prior written notice. Either we or Celgene has the right to terminate the 2017 Celgene Agreement based on the other party’s uncured material breach, challenge of the validity and enforceability of intellectual property, or bankruptcy.

In January 2019, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced the entry into a definitive agreement to acquire Celgene with the intent of creating a leading focused specialty biopharma company. The transaction is expected to complete in the third quarter of 2019, subject to approval by company shareholders, customary closing conditions, and regulatory approvals.
EMD Serono Collaboration 
 In September 2014, we entered into a License Agreement with EMD Serono, or the MDA Agreement, to develop ADCs for multiple cancer targets, which replaced the Collaboration Agreement we had entered into with EMD Serono in May 2014, or the Collaboration Agreement. The most advanced program in the collaboration is a bispecific ADC drug candidate currently in preclinical development. 
 Upon signing the Collaboration Agreement, we received $10.0 million in an upfront payment. In addition, upon signing the MDA Agreement, we received an additional $10.0 million in an upfront payment and receive financial support for our research and development services based on an agreed-upon level of full-time equivalent personnel effort and related reimbursement rate. As of December 31, 2018, we had received approximately $9.3 million in funding support for research and development services. We anticipate entering into a manufacturing supply agreement with EMD Serono to provide them with product candidate materials for IND-enabling and clinical studies. 
 We are eligible to receive up to $52.5 million for each product developed under the MDA Agreement, primarily from pre-commercial contingent payments. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from low to mid single digit percentages, along with certain additional one-time royalties, on worldwide sales of any commercial products that may result from the MDA Agreement. The MDA Agreement term expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the later of the expiration of the patents covering products licensed under the MDA Agreement or ten years after the first commercial sale of a product covered under the MDA Agreement. Upon expiration, EMD Serono will have a fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable non-exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain of our intellectual property rights. 
 EMD Serono may terminate the MDA Agreement at any time with 90 days’ prior written notice or upon our inability to provide EMD Serono access to a specified number of cancer drug targets. Either we or EMD Serono has the right to terminate the MDA Agreement based on the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. 
 Stanford License 
 In October 2007, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive Agreement, or the Stanford License, with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford, that grants us an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under the patent rights owned by Stanford covering certain technology rights related to our XpressCF™ expression system. 
 Upon initiation of the agreement, we made a payment to Stanford of approximately $83,000, of which a portion was creditable against certain prior patent costs incurred by Stanford, reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket costs incurred by Stanford in patent filing, prosecution and maintenance of approximately $184,000, and issued shares of our common stock to Stanford. We are required to make milestone payments to Stanford of up to approximately $930,000 on the accomplishment of certain development and regulatory milestones, of which $180,000 has been paid through December 31, 2018, with a $750,000 payment due upon first commercial sale of the first licensed product consisting of a molecule or compound covered by the licensed patent rights, or the 14th anniversary of the Stanford License in October 2021. Additionally, we owe Stanford annual license maintenance fees of $75,000, which may be creditable against earned royalties in such year, and are required to reimburse Stanford for ongoing patent-related costs. We are also required to pay to Stanford low single digit royalties on net sales and to share any sublicensing income received related to the licensed technology. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 30 days’ written notice. 
 SutroVax Investment 
 In 2013, we and Johnson & Johnson Innovation, through the Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, provided initial co-funding for a new company called SutroVax, Inc., or SutroVax, with which we have a license agreement. Under the agreement, SutroVax has the right to use the XpressCF+™ Platform to discover and develop vaccine candidates for the treatment or prophylaxis of infectious diseases. The lead program for SutroVax is a broad-spectrum pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. SutroVax is responsible for performing all research and development activities, and we provide technical support and supply XtractCF and other materials to SutroVax.

We retain an ownership interest in SutroVax and are eligible for single digit royalties on net sales of any vaccine candidates. Also, we retain the right to discover and develop vaccines for the treatment or prophylaxis of any disease that is not caused by an infectious pathogen, including cancer. 
 Manufacturing 
 We have significant expertise in the production of therapeutic biologics. Our proprietary XpressCF™ Platform is a cell-free protein synthesis technology that enables rapid and systematic process development, streamlined scale-up and cGMP manufacturing. 
Extract and Reagents 
 We manufacture our cell-free extract, and expect to manufacture related reagents, in our cGMP manufacturing facility in San Carlos, California for our clinical trials and supply commitments. If we are successful in developing an effective strategic relationship with a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, we would consider supplementing our manufacturing capacity by outsourcing the production of cell-free extract and related reagents to such CMO to cover our needs during product launch and for long-term commercial supply. 
Drug Substance and Drug Product 
 Our process development and manufacturing strategies are tailored to rapidly advance our product candidates, including the use of a supply chain of established CMOs to ensure successful execution. The production of antibodies will be done by either us or CMOs, depending on our internal cGMP production capacity. The production of all other necessary elements for the manufacture of our ADC product candidates, and the final manufacture of the ADC drug product, will be handled entirely by CMOs. Our XpressCF+™ Platform has been successfully used for manufacturing several antibodies and requires minimal process optimization to support early clinical phase manufacturing. We utilize industry established production steps for the purification of our antibodies. The CMOs we have selected have strong track records in cGMP manufacturing with expertise in clinical or commercial drug manufacturing for the cytotoxic agent, conjugation and fill-finish of therapeutic biologics. All activities from cell-free extract production to formulated drug product are performed to maintain aggressive timelines and minimize delays. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, and the immuno-oncology subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our proprietary XpressCF™ Platform and scientific expertise in the field of biologics and immuno-oncology provide us with competitive advantages, a wide variety of institutions, including large biopharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. We face substantial competition from biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies developing products in immuno-oncology. Our competitors include larger and better funded biopharmaceutical, biotechnological and therapeutics companies, including companies focused on cancer immunotherapies, such as AstraZeneca PLC, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, Roche Holding Ltd, Sanofi S.A and companies focused on ADCs, such as Pfizer, ImmunoGen, Inc., Seattle Genetics, Inc. and Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, as well as numerous small companies. Moreover, we also compete with current and future therapeutics developed at universities and other research institutions. 
 If our lead product candidates are approved, they will compete with a range of therapeutic treatments that are either in development or currently marketed. Currently marketed oncology drugs and therapeutics range from ADCs, such as Genentech’s Kadcyla, to immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as BMS’s Opdivo, to T cell-engager immunotherapies, such as Amgen, Inc.’s Blincyto. In addition, numerous compounds are in clinical development for cancer treatment. With respect to B cell based malignancies, such as multiple myeloma, the most common treatments are chemotherapeutic compounds, radiation therapy, stem cell transplantation and immunomodulating agents. The clinical development pipeline for cancer includes small molecules, antibodies, vaccines, cell therapies and immunotherapies from a variety of companies and institutions.

Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of the entry of our products. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety and convenience of our product candidates. 
 Reimbursement 
 The regulations that govern pricing and reimbursement for new drugs and therapeutic biologics vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug or therapeutic biologic before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription biopharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, a drug company can obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of that product. 
 A drug company’s ability to commercialize any products successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Even if one or more products are successfully brought to the market, these products may not be considered cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for such products may be insufficient to allow them to be sold on a competitive basis. Increasingly, third-party payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government and private insurance plans, are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices, and are seeking to reduce the prices charged or the amounts reimbursed for biopharmaceutical products. 
 Significant delays can occur in obtaining reimbursement for newly-approved drugs or therapeutic biologics, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug or therapeutic biologic is approved by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug or therapeutic biologic will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers a drug company’s costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. 
 Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs or therapeutic biologics, if applicable, may also be insufficient to cover a drug company’s costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may be based on payments allowed for lower cost drugs or therapeutic biologics that are already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other services and may reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data. Net prices for drugs or therapeutic biologics may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs or therapeutic biologics from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.

Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover, but is not limited to, our technology platforms, our product candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our proprietary reagents and assays, and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, platforms and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in our XpressCF™ Platform and product candidates. We expect to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, patent term adjustment and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned or controlled by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; to defend against and challenge the assertion by third parties of their purported intellectual property rights; and to operate without the unauthorized infringement on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. 
 We believe that we have a strong global intellectual property position and substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to our XpressCF™ platform technology, platform and product candidates. Our patent portfolio as of December 31, 2018 contained 12 U.S. issued patents and 78 patents issued in ex-U.S. jurisdictions including Europe, China, Japan, Australia and Singapore and 30 U.S. pending applications as well as 79 patent applications pending in ex-U.S. jurisdictions including Europe, China, Japan, Australia and Singapore owned solely by us. These patents and patent applications include claims relating: 
  
• | bacterial strains, and extracts prepared therefrom, comprising an engineered Release Factor 1 protein, which facilitates incorporation of non-natural amino acids into proteins;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | bacterial strains, and extracts prepared therefrom, comprising combinations of chaperone proteins, which facilitate expression of complex eukaryotic proteins in bacterial extracts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ADCs targeting receptors of interest, including CD74 and FolRα;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | hemiasterlin, both as a cytotoxin and as a linker-warhead, which is used in our STRO-002 product candidate; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | para-azidomethylphenylalanine, or pAMF, and proteins comprising pAMF, our workhorse non-natural amino acid which is primarily used when we conjugate molecules to proteins produced with our XpressCF+™ Platform.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our issued patents, and any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications, in our solely owned patent portfolio are expected to expire between January 2030 and October 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 In addition, we have exclusively licensed the following patent portfolio from Stanford: 15 U.S. issued patents and 44 patents issued in ex-U.S. jurisdictions including Europe, China, Canada, India, Australia, South Korea, Eurasia and Singapore. This patent portfolio includes claims relating to methods related to in vitro protein synthesis that we use in our XpressCF™ Platform when discovering, developing and manufacturing our product candidates. 
 Patents in our patent portfolio licensed from Stanford are expected to expire between March 2019 and January 2028, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 As for the XpressCF™ Platform, product candidates and processes we develop and commercialize, in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue, where appropriate, patent protection or trade secret protection relating to compositions, methods of manufacture, assay methods, methods of use, treatment of indications, dosing and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to product development processes and technology.

We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new platform technologies and product candidates. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications if our intellectual property strategy requires such filings, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, relating to the new technologies that we develop. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we often file counterpart patent applications in the European Union and in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including but not limited to any or all of Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea.

The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. However, the term of United States patents may be extended for delays incurred due to compliance with the FDA requirements or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO. For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our biopharmaceutical product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Our currently issued patents will likely expire on dates ranging from 2030 to 2035, unless we receive patent term extension or patent term adjustment, or both. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2033 to 2039, unless we receive patent term extension or patent term adjustment, or both. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immunotherapy has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in the patent laws and rules, either by legislation, judicial decisions, or regulatory interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our platforms and product candidates and the methods used to manufacture those platforms and product candidates. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our platform’s product candidates. However, the area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented XpressCF™ technology, platforms and product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related platforms or product candidates or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our XpressCF™ technology, platforms and product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our XpressCF™ technology, platforms and product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
 We intend to file applications for trademark registrations in connection with our product candidates in various jurisdictions, including the United States. We have filed for trademark protection of the Sutro Biopharma mark, the XpressCF™ mark and the XpressCF+™ mark with the USPTO. XpressCF™ refers to our cell-free protein synthesis technology as a whole, and XpressCF+™ refers specifically to cell-free protein synthesis incorporating one or more non-natural amino acids. The Sutro Biopharma mark was registered by the USPTO in 2014 and the XpressCF™ and XpressCF+™ marks were registered by the USPTO in 2017.

We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our confidential and proprietary information as trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our confidentiality and other agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors require them to assign or grant us licenses to inventions they invent as a result of the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions. 
 We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of new drug applications, or NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
 Biological product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the biologic for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. In oncology clinical trials, efficacy endpoints are also often explored in Phase 1. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In some instances, trial phases may be truncated or combined into one or more combined-phase or adaptive design trials. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the biologic. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in certain oncological conditions where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. 
 The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access. 
 After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,588,000 for Fiscal Year 2019. The applicant under an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently exceeding $309,000 per prescription drug product for Fiscal Year 2019. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2018, this annual program fee replaced the annual product and establishment fees. These fees are typically increased annually. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologic products are reviewed within 10 months of the date the FDA files the BLA; most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the BLA. Priority review can be applied to a biologic that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.

The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure, potent and effective in the indication studied. 
 After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. 
 Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs. 
 Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a fast track biologic concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Under the fast track program and FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a biologic for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, will allow the FDA to withdraw the biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for biologic candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. In October 2018, we were granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA, for STRO-001 for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the biological product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a product with particular principal molecular structural features to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a biological product containing the same active moiety for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same biological product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
Pediatric Information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, BLAs or supplements to BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, except a product with a new active ingredient that is molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer that is subject to an NDA or BLA submitted on or after August 18, 2020. 
Additional Controls for Biologics 
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHS Act also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.

After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 A biologic product may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will respond to a therapy. If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product. 
 Pursuing FDA approval of an in vitro companion diagnostic usually would require a pre-market approval, or PMA, for that diagnostic. Based on a final FDA guidance document, and the FDA’s past treatment of companion diagnostics, the FDA will likely require PMA approval of an in vitro companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for a cancer therapy. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Approval of a companion diagnostic is generally required at the time of new drug approval. 
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. The applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness, including information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $322,000 for most PMAs for Fiscal Year 2019. In addition, PMAs for devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results between multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.

PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time consuming to generate and that can substantially delay or prevent approval. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. 
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also register with FDA and list their devices. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. 
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, denial of submissions for new products, or withdrawal of PMA approvals. 
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other healthcare laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. 
 Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offerer or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, imposes obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. 
 Further, pursuant to the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, has issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reports must be submitted on an annual basis and the reported data are posted in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Effective January 1, 2022, transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives must also be reported.
 In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Additional jurisdictions, such as the City of Chicago and the District of Columbia, require pharmaceutical sales representatives to be licensed and meet continuing education requirements. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. 
 Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.

U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of health care and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, (i) subjected therapeutic biologics to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars by creating a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products, (ii) proscribed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs and therapeutic biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, (iii) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, (iv) established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and therapeutic biologics, (v) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices (increased to 70% beginning in 2019) of applicable brand drugs and therapeutic biologics to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs and therapeutic biologics to be covered under Medicare Part D, (vi) expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, (vii) expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program (viii) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research, and (ix) established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 The current U.S. presidential administration and Congress have, and we expect they will continue to, seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. Since January 2017, the current U.S. presidential administration has issued two executive orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. For example, on October 12, 2017, the current U.S. presidential administration issued an executive order that expands the use of association health plans and allows anyone to purchase short-term health plans that provide temporary, limited insurance. This executive order also calls for the halt of federal payments to health insurers for cost-sharing reductions previously available to lower-income Americans to afford coverage. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact this executive order could have on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, among other things, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, the current U.S. presidential administration signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. More recently, in July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact the current U.S. presidential administration and the Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the ACA. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures. U.S. federal government agencies also currently face potentially significant spending reductions, which may further impact healthcare expenditures. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A joint select committee on deficit reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Moreover, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If federal spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions, as well as potential future shutdowns of the U.S. federal government, may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop.  
 
Moreover, payment methodologies, including payment for companion diagnostics, may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. In addition, CMS has begun bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting and, beginning in 2018, CMS will pay for clinical laboratory services based on a weighted average of reported prices that private payors, Medicare Advantage plans, and Medicaid Managed Care plans pay for laboratory services. Further, on March 16, 2018, CMS finalized its National Coverage Determination, or NCD, for certain diagnostic laboratory tests using next generation sequencing, or NGS, that are approved by the FDA as a companion in vitro diagnostic and used in a cancer with an FDA-approved companion diagnostic indication. Under the NCD, diagnostic tests that gain FDA approval or clearance as an in vitro companion diagnostic will automatically receive full coverage and be available for patients with recurrent, metastatic relapsed, refractory or stages III and IV cancer. Additionally, the NCD extended coverage to repeat testing when the patient has a new primary diagnosis of cancer. 
 Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the current U.S. presidential administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, on May 11, 2018, the current U.S. presidential administration laid out the administration’s “Blueprint” to reduce the cost of prescription medications while preserving innovation and cures. While the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, is soliciting feedback on some of these measures, other actions may be immediately implemented by HHS under existing authority. Although a number of these, and other potential, proposals will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the current U.S. presidential administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA authorization under an FDA expanded access program.
