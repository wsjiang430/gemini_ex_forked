ITEM 1. BUSINESS
​
We are a biotechnology company dedicated to breaking through barriers in gene therapy and neurology. We believe the potential of both disciplines has been constrained by delivery challenges; we are leveraging expertise in capsid discovery and neuropharmacology to address these constraints. Our gene therapy platforms enable us to engineer, optimize, manufacture and deliver AAV based gene therapies that we believe have the potential to safely provide durable efficacy. Our team of experts in the field of AAV gene therapy and neuroscience first identifies and selects diseases in which we believe an AAV gene therapy or other biological therapy will answer a high unmet medical need, be supported by target validation, offer an efficient path to human proof of biology, present robust preclinical pharmacology, and offer strong commercial potential. We then engineer and optimize an AAV vector or other biological therapy for activity in, efficacy in, or delivery to, the targeted tissue or cells. 
We are identifying proprietary AAV capsids, the outer viral protein shells that enclose genetic material that makes up the vector payload. Our team has developed a proprietary AAV capsid discovery platform called TRACERTM (Tropism Redirection of AAV by Cell Type-Specific Expression of RNA) that employs directed evolution to facilitate the selection of AAV capsids with enhanced tissue delivery characteristics, such as more effective delivery across the blood brain barrier, or BBB. The TRACER discovery platform is a broadly applicable, functional RNA-based AAV capsid discovery platform that allows for rapid in vivo evolution of AAV capsids with cell-specific transduction properties in multiple species, including non-human primates. We believe that capsids we discover through our TRACER discovery platform, which we refer to as TRACER capsids, have the potential to significantly enhance the efficacy and safety of our single dose gene therapies, which we expect to be delivered with systemic infusions, as compared with conventional capsids.
In addition to leveraging TRACER capsids in potential licensing arrangements, we are advancing our own proprietary pipeline of drug candidates for neurological diseases. Our wholly-owned prioritized pipeline programs include: superoxide dismutase 1, or SOD1, gene therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and an anti-tau antibody for Alzheimer’s disease. We have identified a lead development candidate for our anti-tau antibody program and we expect to identify a lead development candidate for our SOD1 program during the first half of 2023. We expect to file INDs for both programs in 2024. In addition to these two wholly-owned programs, we are actively advancing two programs in collaboration with Neurocrine: a glucocerebrosidase 1, or GBA1, gene therapy program for Parkinson’s disease and other GBA1-mediated diseases, and a FXN gene therapy program for Friedreich’s ataxia. We also maintain a robust early research pipeline of wholly-owned and collaborative gene therapy programs for neurological diseases.
Mission and Strategy
Our mission is to is leverage our expertise in neuroscience and our pioneering discoveries in AAV capsids to advance life-changing gene therapies and other therapeutic modalities for neurological diseases. Our strategy to achieve this mission is to:

AAV Gene Therapy
​
Gene therapy is an approach whereby gene expression is directly altered in patients to address the underlying cause or predominant manifestations of disease. We believe that the targeted nature of gene therapy may enable powerful treatment options and provide these patients with meaningful and durable benefits. 
​
While AAV gene therapy can potentially be harnessed for multiple treatment methods, we are currently focused on gene replacement, gene knockdown and vectorized antibody approaches. Gene replacement is intended to restore the expression of a protein that is not expressed, expressed at abnormally low levels or functionally mutated with loss of function. Gene knockdown, or gene silencing, is intended to reduce the expression of a pathologically mutated RNA or protein that has detrimental effects. Vectorizing an antibody for delivery using AAV has the ability to increase exposure of large antibodies in brain parenchyma and interstitial fluid that otherwise show minimal penetration across the BBB when administered passively. Our gene therapy approach uses AAV vectors which we believe are ideal vectors for gene therapy for several reasons:
 ​

● | Broad Applicability. AAV is able to transduce, or transfer a therapeutic gene, into numerous cell types including target cells in the central nervous system, or CNS, cardiac, and other tissues.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Safety. We believe AAV is safe and is not known to cause any disease in humans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Does Not Readily Integrate. AAV does not readily integrate into the genome of the target cell, an attribute which we believe reduces the potential for oncogenesis, or the induction of cancer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scalability. AAV is able to be manufactured at commercial quality and scale.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that neurological diseases are well-suited for treatment with AAV gene therapy for the following reasons: 

● | Validated Targets. Many neurological, cardiac, and other diseases are caused by well-defined mutations in genes and these genes represent genetically validated drug targets for AAV gene therapy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Targeted Delivery. We believe our TRACER capsids may allow for significantly enhanced gene therapy delivery to specific types of cells and tissues at lower doses.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Durable Expression. Long-term gene expression may be achievable in the CNS and other tissues following one-time dosing and transfer of the therapeutic gene with an AAV vector. Because repeated or continual dosing with direct injection of drugs into the CNS and other tissues is complex, a one-time AAV gene therapy has significant advantages.

The Voyager Gene Therapy Platform
We have built a gene therapy platform that we believe positions us to be the leading company at the intersection of AAV gene therapy and neurological diseases. Our team of experts in the field of AAV gene therapy first identifies and selects diseases that are well-suited for treatment using AAV gene therapy. We then engineer and optimize AAV vectors, identifying a capsid for delivery of a payload, comprising a therapeutic gene or transgene, and a promoter to drive expression of the transgene, to the targeted tissue or cells. Finally, we leverage established routes of administration and advances in dosing techniques to optimize delivery of our AAV vectors to target cells that are critical to the disease of interest. We believe that optimizing each of these parameters is a key factor for overall program success. We expect that our current and future pipeline programs will make use of technological advances generated with our gene therapy platform. 
Disease Selection 
Following an internal review process, we have prioritized pipeline programs for our development. This review evaluated the opportunity presented by each prioritized program based on the following criteria: high unmet medical need, target validation, efficient path to human proof of biology, robust preclinical pharmacology, and strong commercial potential. 
Vector Engineering and Optimization
The key components of an AAV vector include: (a) the capsid; (b) the therapeutic gene, or transgene; and (c) payload control elements, including the promoter or other DNA sequences that modulate the expression of the transgene. We have advanced or intend to advance our multiple preclinical programs towards selection of lead clinical candidates using AAV vectors that we believe are best suited for each of our programs either through use of our existing capsids, through exercising a non-exclusive worldwide commercial license to capsid sequences covered by third parties, or by engineering or optimizing TRACER capsids. We have also built, or intend to build, capabilities to design, screen, and advance genetic sequences within our AAV vectors, including transgenes and payload control elements, to create optimized therapeutic candidates for each of our preclinical programs.
TRACER Capsid Discovery
​
Our scientists have developed TRACER, a proprietary AAV capsid discovery platform to facilitate the selection of TRACER capsids for particular therapeutic applications based on BBB-crossing and cell-specific transduction properties in multiple species, including non-human primates, or NHPs. We believe these TRACER capsids may allow for significantly enhanced gene delivery to specific types of cells in the brain at lower doses and, potentially, with fewer safety and tolerability issues than first-generation therapies. These TRACER capsids are now in advanced stages of characterization for deployment in our gene therapy development programs. We continue to perform screening campaigns with our TRACER discovery platform to identify additional proprietary AAV9- and AAV5-derived TRACER capsids and to refine previously-identified TRACER capsids to target or de-target multiple tissue and cell types.
​
We are actively engaged in discussions to make TRACER capsids available to third parties for use in their drug development programs through potential option and license and other arrangements. We believe there is significant opportunity for option and license transactions related to our TRACER capsids. To maximize the potential of our TRACER capsids for both our own programs and option and license transactions, we have retained to date, and expect to retain in the future, all rights associated with such TRACER capsids other than the rights specific to their use in combination with the optionee’s or licensee’s transgenes or collaborators’ programs.
​
Collaboration Agreements 
​
In January 2019, we entered into a collaboration with Neurocrine, or the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, for the research, development and commercialization of certain of our AAV gene therapy products. Under the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, we agreed to collaborate on the conduct of four collaboration programs, which we refer to collectively as the 2019 Neurocrine Programs: the NBIb-1817 (VY-AADC) program, or the VY-

8



AADC Program for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, the program for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia, or the FA Program, including the development of the VY-FXN01 product candidate, which together with the VY-AADC Program, we refer to as the Legacy Programs, and other undisclosed programs, or the 2019 Discovery Programs and, collectively with the Legacy Programs, the 2019 Neurocrine Programs. In August 2021, the collaboration was terminated with respect to the VY-AADC Program. Under the FA Program, we and Neurocrine are currently developing a gene therapy for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia, a debilitating neurodegenerative disease resulting in poor coordination of legs and arms, progressive loss of the ability to walk, generalized weakness, loss of sensation, scoliosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy as well as impaired vision, hearing, and speech. Development of the two targets approved by the joint steering committee under the 2019 Discovery Program will continue into 2023.
​
On January 8, 2023, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Neurocrine, or the 2023 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, for the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of gene therapy products directed to the gene that encodes GBA1 for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other diseases associated with GBA1, or the GBA1 Program, and three new programs focused on the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of gene therapies designed to address CNS diseases or conditions associated with rare genetic targets, or the 2023 Discovery Programs and, collectively with the GBA1 Program, the 2023 Neurocrine Programs. The 2023 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement became effective on February 21, 2023. For more information, refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
License Agreements
​
In October 2021, we entered into an option and license agreement with Pfizer, or the Pfizer Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Pfizer options to receive an exclusive license, or the Pfizer License Options, to certain TRACER capsids to develop and commercialize certain AAV gene therapy candidates comprised of a capsid and specified Pfizer transgenes, or Pfizer Transgenes. 
​
In March 2022, we entered into an option and license agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, with our collaborative partner Novartis. Pursuant to the Novartis Agreement, we have granted Novartis options, or the Novartis License Options, to license TRACER capsids, or the Novartis Licensed Capsids, for exclusive use with certain targets to develop and commercialize certain adeno-associated virus gene therapy candidates comprised of a Novartis Licensed Capsid and a payload directed to such target, or a Novartis Payload. 
​
In November 2022, we and Touchlight IP Limited, or Touchlight, entered into a license agreement, or the Touchlight License Agreement, to authorize historical use by us of a certain DNA preparation process, or the Subject DNA Preparation Process, and to authorize the prospective exploitation of TRACER capsids created with the use of the Subject DNA Preparation Process.
​
Overview of Our Pipeline
We have leveraged our TRACER discovery platform and other gene therapy platforms, our expertise with proprietary antibodies, and our vectorized antibody platform to assemble a pipeline of proprietary AAV gene therapies and passive and vectorized payloads for the treatment of neurological and other diseases which we believe have high unmet medical need. Depending on the disease, we are seeking to develop AAV gene therapies that will use a gene replacement or gene silencing approach, and antibodies that will use a passive administration or vectorized delivery approach. Our goal is to address the underlying cause or the predominant manifestations of specific diseases by significantly increasing or decreasing expression of the relevant proteins in targeted tissues.

​
Anti-Tau Antibody Program for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease
​
Disease Overview
We are developing proprietary antibodies that selectively target and reduce the spread of pathological tau for the treatment of tauopathies, and our lead indication is Alzheimer’s disease, or AD. The spread of tau pathology closely correlates with disease progression and cognitive decline in AD, which affects approximately 6 million people in the United States, and is a growing health care burden to society. Recently, anti-amyloid antibodies have been approved for treatment of AD, and there is substantial remaining unmet medical need.
​
Our Treatment Approach
We have maintained a long-standing focus on developing proprietary and complimentary approaches to disrupt the progression of tau pathology believed to be central to AD and other tauopathies. Reduction of toxic tau aggregates may slow disease progression and cognitive decline in these diseases. We are exploring passive administration of our anti-tau antibody. Our anti-tau antibodies have differentiated properties including improved targeting of specific regions of tau protein that could offer an improved profile compared to first-generation approaches. We believe that our antibody targeting the C-terminus is highly differentiated from other approaches. Further, we believe that following the clearance of an IND application, clinical assessments utilizing positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of human tau, together with measuring plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, have the potential to enable an efficient and accelerated demonstration of human proof-of-biology. 
Preclinical Studies
At the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in August 2022, we presented data for our proprietary anti-tau antibodies, targeting the mid-domain and C-terminus with high affinity and showing favorable biophysical characteristics and strong activity in preclinical studies in mouse models. In the P301S seeding-propagation tauopathy 

10



mouse model, our C-terminal targeting anti-tau antibody blocked the seeding/propagation of filamentous tau and demonstrated substantial reduction of induced tau pathology.
Program Status
In January 2023, we selected a lead humanized anti-tau antibody candidate to advance against AD. The lead candidate, VY-TAU01, targets the C-terminal domain. VY-TAU01 was selected for its affinity, selectivity, and biophysical characteristics. Process development and manufacturing at a contracted manufacturer have been initiated, and we expect to initiate a good laboratory practices, or GLP, toxicology study later in 2023 to enable an IND filing in the first half of 2024.
​
Friedreich’s Ataxia Program: VY-FXN01 (2019 Neurocrine Collaboration)
Disease Overview 
Friedreich’s ataxia is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease resulting in poor coordination of legs and arms, progressive loss of the ability to walk, generalized weakness, loss of sensation, scoliosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy as well as impaired vision, hearing and speech. The typical age of onset is 10 to 12 years, and life expectancy is severely reduced with patients generally dying of neurological and cardiac complications between the ages of 35 and 45. According to the Friedreich’s ataxia Research Alliance, there are approximately 6,400 patients living with the disease in the United States. While one treatment for Friedreich’s ataxia has recently been approved by the FDA, there remains a significant unmet need. 
Friedreich’s ataxia patients have mutations of the FXN gene that reduce production of the frataxin protein, resulting in the degeneration of sensory pathways and a variety of debilitating symptoms. Friedreich’s ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a person must obtain a defective copy of the FXN gene from both parents in order to develop the condition. One healthy copy of the FXN gene, or 50% of normal frataxin protein levels, is sufficient to prevent the disease phenotype. We therefore believe that restoring FXN protein levels to at least 50% of normal levels by AAV gene therapy might lead to a successful therapy. 
Our Treatment Approach 
We are seeking to develop an AAV gene therapy approach that we believe will deliver a functional version of the FXN gene to the sensory pathways through intravenous injection. We think this approach has the potential to improve balance, ability to walk, sensory capability, coordination, strength and functional capacity of Friedreich’s ataxia patients. Most Friedreich’s ataxia patients produce low levels of the frataxin protein, which although insufficient to prevent the disease, exposes the patient’s immune system to frataxin. This reduces the likelihood that the FXN protein expressed by AAV gene therapy will trigger a harmful immune response. 
Preclinical Studies 
We initially conducted preclinical studies in non-human primates and achieved high FXN expression levels within the target sensory ganglia, or clusters of neurons, along the spinal region following intrathecal injection. More recently, we conducted preclinical studies in non-human primates with IV injection and achieved target FXN expression levels within sensory ganglia and the heart. The levels of FXN expression observed in the brain using an AAV vector were, on average, greater than FXN levels present in control normal human brain tissue. FXN expression was also observed in the cerebellar dentate nucleus, another area of the CNS that is often affected in Friedreich’s ataxia, and that is often considered difficult to target therapeutically. 
Our Program Status 
As part of the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration, we are developing VY-FXN01 for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia. VY-FXN01 is currently in preclinical development. We and Neurocrine are in the process of identifying a lead candidate that will comprise a capsid, promoter, and FXN transgene and are evaluating the potential use of TRACER 

11



capsids in the program. We are completing AAV capsid biodistribution experiments to confirm capsid serotypes that effectively transduce disease target tissues in non-human primates following intravenous injection. Criteria for evaluating these capsids include safety, the overall level of transgene expression achieved, and the anatomic and cellular distribution of the transgene expression. Also, we have optimized the promoter for VY-FXN01 to achieve an acceptable therapeutic index for frataxin replacement. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of our vectors, we have conducted testing in a new genetic mouse model of Friedreich’s ataxia. In this preclinical model of Friedreich’s ataxia, our gene therapy candidates durably improved sensory function and rescued the disease phenotype based on multiple functional tests. In physiological and behavioral assays, our gene therapy candidates demonstrated dose-dependent and durable responses for more than 10 months after a single administration, preventing central and peripheral disease progression. We also have a significant effort focused on better understanding the clinical course of Friedreich’s ataxia, identifying potential fluid biomarkers and selecting clinical endpoints for future clinical trials. As part of our portfolio reevaluation and strategic shift to invest in novel capsid development efforts, we and Neurocrine are evaluating the potential use of our TRACER capsids to allow for enhanced transduction across the disease target tissues. If we and Neurocrine successfully identify a development candidate and capsid for this program, we plan to complete IND enabling studies to evaluate its safety and efficacy.
​
SOD1 Gene Silencing Program for the Treatment of ALS
Disease Overview
We are developing a gene therapy leveraging a BBB-penetrant, CNS-tropic TRACER capsid to treat ALS caused by the SOD1 mutation via a gene silencing approach. SOD1 ALS is typically fatal within approximately three years of diagnosis and impacts approximately 800 patients in the United States, 1,000 patients in the European Union, and 500 patients in Japan. SOD1 mutations in ALS patients are thought to cause a toxic gain-of-function that leads to the degeneration of motor neurons along the entire length of the spinal cord, the brainstem, and the upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. 
Our Treatment Approach
We believe that a therapeutic delivering a vectorized highly potent small interfering RNA, or siRNA, construct via intravenous administration of an AAV gene therapy with a vectorized siRNA may enable broad CNS knockdown of SOD1, potentially slowing the decline of functional ability in ALS patients with the SOD1 mutation. We believe that a Phase 1 clinical trial to demonstrate reduction in SOD1 in cerebrospinal fluid and neurofilament light chain in plasma will provide evidence of target engagement and the attenuation of motor neuron loss, respectively. 
Preclinical Studies
At the ASGCT 2022 Meeting, we presented preclinical data demonstrating robust SOD1 knockdown in all levels of the spinal cord and significant improvements in motor performance, body weight, and survival in an SOD1-ALS mouse model following intravenous delivery of a vectorized siRNA using a mouse BBB-penetrant capsid. 
Program Status
We have identified a potent and specific vectorized siRNA transgene that resulted in substantially extended lifespan and motor function when delivered using a BBB-penetrant capsid in an animal model. We are currently in the process of selecting a TRACER capsid with BBB-penetration activity in NHP studies for selection of a lead candidate vector.
GBA1 Gene Replacement Program for the Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease (2023 Neurocrine Collaboration)
Disease Overview
We are developing a gene therapy leveraging a BBB-penetrant, CNS-tropic TRACER capsid to treat diseases linked to GBA1 mutations via a gene replacement approach. Our lead indication for this gene therapy is Parkinson’s 

12



disease with GBA1 mutations. Mutations in GBA1, the gene encoding the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase enzyme, or Gcase, are the most common genetic risk factor for synucleinopathies such as Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is among the most common neurodegenerative diseases, impacting about one million patients in the United States and more than 10.0 million patients worldwide. Up to 10% of Parkinson’s disease patients have a GBA1 mutation, and these mutations increase the risk of Parkinson’s disease by approximately 20-fold. GBA1 mutations can decrease the activity of Gcase, leading to the accumulation of Gcase substrates which is linked to alpha-synuclein aggregates, that are thought to be toxic to neurons. 
Our Treatment Approach
We believe that restoring Gcase activity may attenuate disease progression and potentially slow neurodegeneration. We anticipate delivering GBA1 via intravenous administration of an AAV gene therapy to enable widespread distribution to multiple affected brain regions and to avoid the need for more invasive approaches. We believe that the measurement of the Gcase substrates such as glucosylsphingosine as cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers may facilitate efficient clinical demonstration of proof-of-biology. Such substrates of the Gcase enzyme are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of Parkinson’s disease patients who harbor the GBA1 mutation, and we expect that substrate levels would be normalized if our gene therapy restores Gcase enzyme expression in the brain. This gene therapy may also have potential utility in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, where there is evidence of loss of Gcase activity in the substantia nigra in Parkinson’s disease patients even in the absence of GBA1 mutations as well as evidence of lysosomal dysfunction in general.
Preclinical Studies
​
At the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy 25th Annual Meeting in May 2022, or the ASGCT 2022 Meeting, we presented preclinical data demonstrating CNS target engagement and delivery of therapeutically relevant levels of Gcase in a GBA1 loss of function mouse model, as well as sustained expression for three or more months following intravenous administration. 
​
Program Status
​
 Under the 2023 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, we are developing gene therapy products directed to the gene that encodes GBA1 for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other diseases associated with GBA1. The GBA1 Program is currently in preclinical development. We and Neurocrine are in the process of identifying a lead candidate that will comprise a TRACER capsid, promoter, and transgene. For more information, refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Early Research Programs
​
In January 2023, we announced the launch of an updated early research initiative for the treatment of Huntington’s disease. The updated gene therapy program, which leverages the latest insights in disease biology, combines an intravenous TRACER capsid with vectorized siRNAs to enable specific knockdown of mHTT and MSH3.
​
During the first quarter of 2023, we announced an early research initiative investigating a gene therapy targeting intracellular tau for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The program combines an siRNA tau knockdown payload with an intravenously delivered TRACER capsid.
​
Our wholly-owned early research programs also include a program exploring a vectorized antibody against HER2 for the treatment of brain metastases from metastatic breast cancer. Pre-clinical data has demonstrated that our vectorized antibody against HER2 is shown to inhibit proliferation and promote antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, a process that recruits natural killer cells, macrophages and/or brain-resident innate immune cells called microglia to eliminate tumor cells.

Collaborations and License Agreements
Pfizer Option and License Agreement
On October 1, 2021, or the Pfizer Effective Date, we entered into the Pfizer Agreement with Pfizer pursuant to which we granted Pfizer the Pfizer License Options to certain TRACER capsids to develop and commercialize certain AAV gene therapy candidates comprised of a capsid and specified Pfizer Transgenes. Under the terms of the Pfizer Agreement, during an initial research term that ended as of October 1, 2022, or the Pfizer Research Term, Pfizer had the right to evaluate the potential use of the capsids in combination with up to two Pfizer Transgenes to help treat respective CNS and cardiovascular diseases. 
​
Research and License Option
​
During the Pfizer Research Term, we agreed to provide Pfizer with certain quantities of materials encoding specified existing capsids for Pfizer’s evaluation. Further, during the Pfizer Research Term, we agreed to disclose to Pfizer, on a rolling basis, the performance characteristics identified during the Pfizer Research Term for all such capsid candidates. Pfizer had the right, in its sole discretion, to select any capsid candidate for evaluation to determine its interest in exercising a Pfizer License Option with respect to such capsid candidate. Pfizer had the right to exercise up to two Pfizer License Options, provided that it could exercise only one Pfizer License Option for each Pfizer Transgene.
​
Effective as of September 30, 2022, Pfizer exercised a Pfizer License Option with respect to a capsid for the specified Pfizer Transgene for potential treatment of a rare neurological disease. Pfizer did not exercise its option to license a capsid for the potential treatment of a cardiovascular disease. As result, Pfizer’s right to exercise a Pfizer License Option for a cardiovascular disease has terminated in accordance with the terms of the Pfizer Agreement and all rights to capsids for that cardiovascular disease have reverted to us. Pfizer’s exercise of a Pfizer License Option extends the Pfizer Research Term to October 1, 2024, during which period we may, at our sole discretion and expense, conduct additional research activities to identify additional proprietary capsids that may be useful for AAV gene therapies for the treatment of the rare neurological disease associated with the exercise of the applicable Pfizer License Option.
​
In connection with the exercise of the Pfizer License Option for a rare neurological disease, we granted Pfizer an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under certain of our intellectual property, the rights to develop and commercialize rare neurological disease products utilizing the capsid candidate and incorporating the corresponding Pfizer Transgene, or the Pfizer Licensed CNS Products. Until October 1, 2024, while we are not obligated to conduct additional research activities to identify additional proprietary capsids that may be useful for AAV gene therapies for the treatment of rare neurological diseases, we have agreed to continue to disclose to Pfizer, on a rolling basis, the performance characteristics identified for all such capsid candidates that we identify during the Pfizer Research Term, if and when available. Pfizer may, during the Pfizer Research Term, conduct additional evaluations of such capsid candidates and has the right to substitute any other capsid candidate for the capsid it previously elected to license when it exercised the Pfizer License Option.
​
Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization
Under the Pfizer Agreement, Pfizer is solely responsible for, and has sole decision-making authority with respect to, development and commercialization of the Pfizer Licensed CNS Products. Pfizer is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for at least one Pfizer Licensed CNS Product for which Pfizer has exercised its Pfizer License Option in (a) the United States and (b) at least one of the following countries: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan, each of which is referred to as a Pfizer Major Market Country, subject to certain limitations. Pfizer is also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize each Pfizer Licensed CNS Product in the United States and at least one Pfizer Major Market Country where Pfizer or its designated affiliates or sublicensees has received regulatory approval for such Pfizer Licensed CNS Product, subject to certain limitations.

Subject to a cure period, either party may terminate the Pfizer Agreement, in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions, in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. Pfizer may also terminate the Pfizer Agreement, in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions, for our insolvency, the occurrence of a violation of global trade control laws, or for our non-compliance with certain anti-bribery or anti-corruption covenants. Pfizer may also terminate the Pfizer Agreement, in whole or in part, for any or no reason upon ninety days’ written notice to us. 
​
Upon certain terminations for cause by Pfizer, the license granted by us to Pfizer under the Pfizer Agreement shall become irrevocable and perpetual, and all milestone payments and royalties that would have otherwise been payable by Pfizer under such license had the Pfizer Agreement remained in effect would be substantially reduced.
Novartis Option and License Agreement
On March 4, 2022, or the Novartis Effective Date, we entered into the Novartis Agreement with our collaborative partner Novartis. Pursuant to the Novartis Agreement, we have granted Novartis the Novartis License Options to license Novartis Licensed Capsids, for exclusive use with certain targets to develop and commercialize a Novartis Payload. 
​

Research and License Option 
​
During the period commencing on the Novartis Effective Date and ending on the first anniversary thereof or, in the event Novartis exercises a Novartis License Option, the third anniversary thereof, we have granted Novartis a non-exclusive research license to evaluate our TRACER capsids for potential use, in combination with Novartis Payloads, in programs targeting three specified genes, or the Initial Novartis Targets. We refer to this period, on a target-by-target basis, as the Novartis Research Term. Upon the payment of additional fees, Novartis may also assess our TRACER capsids for use with up to two other targets, or the Additional Novartis Targets, subject to certain conditions including that such target is not part of, or reasonably competitive with, our current development programs. During the Novartis Research Term, as applicable, we may, at our sole discretion and expense, conduct further research activities to identify additional TRACER capsids. If we elect to do so, we have agreed to disclose performance characteristics of such new TRACER capsids to Novartis on a rolling basis.
​
During the applicable Novartis Research Terms, Novartis may exercise up to three Novartis License Options—or up to five Novartis License Options if Novartis is evaluating the Additional Novartis Targets—in the aggregate, provided that Novartis may only exercise one Novartis License Option for each Novartis Target. Upon the exercise of any Novartis License Option, we have agreed to grant Novartis a target-exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under certain of our intellectual property, the rights to develop and commercialize the applicable Novartis Licensed Capsid as incorporated into products containing the corresponding Novartis Payload, or the Novartis Licensed Products. Upon the exercise of a Novartis License Option, we have agreed to provide certain additional know-how to enable Novartis to exploit the Novartis Licensed Capsid and the corresponding Novartis Payload for use in a Novartis Licensed Product. Novartis may, during the applicable Novartis Research Term but following the exercise of a Novartis License Option, conduct additional evaluation of our capsid candidates and has the right to substitute any other TRACER capsid for the Novartis Licensed Capsid.
​
Effective as of March 1, 2023, Novartis exercised its Novartis License Options to license novel capsids generated from our TRACER capsid discovery platform for use in gene therapy programs against two undisclosed Initial Novartis Targets. With Novartis’ option exercise on two Initial Novartis Targets, we are entitled to receive a $25.0 million option exercise payment during the first half of 2023, and we are eligible to receive associated potential development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, as well as mid- to high-single-digit tiered royalties based on net sales of the Novartis Licensed Products incorporating the Novartis Licensed Capsids. The two Initial Novartis Targets licensed are distinct from targets in our internal and partnered pipeline. In addition, over the next 18 months, Novartis retains the right to expand the agreement to include options to license capsids for up to two Additional Novartis Targets, subject to their availability, for a fee of $18.0 million per Additional Novartis Target. Under such an expansion, we would be eligible to receive a $12.5 million license option exercise fee for each Additional Novartis Target exercised, as well as future potential milestone payments per Additional Novartis Target and mid- to high-single-digit tiered royalties on the Novartis Licensed Products incorporating the Novartis Licensed Capsids.
​
Novartis elected not to license a capsid for one Initial Novartis Target under the Novartis Agreement prior to the expiration of the applicable Novartis License Option. As a result, the non-exclusive research license that we granted to Novartis in connection with this Initial Novartis Target has terminated, the Novartis Research Term for this Initial Novartis Target has expired, and we are no longer eligible to receive development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments or royalties in connection with this Initial Novartis Target. All capsid rights with respect to that Initial Novartis Target have returned to us.
​
Governance 
​
Subject to our disclosure obligations described above, we and Novartis have agreed to conduct our respective research and evaluation activities independently, with communications being managed by two alliance managers comprised of a designee from each of us and Novartis.
​

Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization
​
Under the Novartis Agreement, Novartis is solely responsible for, and has sole decision-making authority with respect to, development and commercialization of the Novartis Licensed Products. In the event Novartis exercises a Novartis License Option, Novartis is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for at least one Novartis Licensed Product for each Novartis Target for which it has exercised a Novartis License Option in (a) the United States and (b) at least three of the following countries: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan, each of which, a Novartis Major Market Country, subject to certain limitations. Novartis is also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize each Novartis Licensed Product in the United States and at least three Novartis Major Market Countries where Novartis or its designated affiliates or sublicensees has received regulatory approval for such Novartis Licensed Product, subject to certain limitations.
During the applicable Novartis Research Term, we have agreed to provide plasmids to Novartis for the production of TRACER capsids for evaluation upon request. We have also granted Novartis a non-exclusive license, effective upon an exercise of a Novartis License Option and in addition to its options for target-exclusive licenses under certain of our intellectual property described above, on a Novartis Licensed Capsid-by-Novartis Licensed Capsid basis, under certain of our know-how to exploit the applicable Novartis Licensed Capsid as incorporated into Novartis Licensed Products containing the corresponding Novartis Payload.
Financial
Under the terms of the Novartis Agreement, Novartis has paid us an upfront payment of $54.0 million. Effective as of March 1, 2023, Novartis exercised its Novartis License Options to license two novel capsids generated from our TRACER capsid discovery platform for use in gene therapy programs against two undisclosed Initial Novartis Targets. With the exercise of two Novartis License Options, we have become entitled to receive a $25.0 million option exercise payment during the first half of 2023, and we are eligible to receive associated potential development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, as well as mid- to high-single-digit tiered royalties based on net sales of the Novartis Licensed Products incorporating the Novartis Licensed Capsids. The two Initial Novartis Targets licensed are distinct from targets in our internal and partnered pipeline. In addition, over the next 18 months, Novartis retains the right to expand the collaboration to include options to license capsids for up to two Additional Novartis Targets, subject to their availability, for a fee of $18.0 million per Additional Novartis Target. Under such an expansion, we would be eligible to receive a $12.5 million license option exercise fee for each Additional Novartis Target exercised, as well as future potential milestone payments per Additional Novartis Target and mid- to high-single-digit tiered royalties on the Novartis Licensed Products incorporating the Novartis Licensed Capsids. The royalties are subject to potential reductions in customary circumstances including patent claim expiration, payments for certain third-party licenses, and biosimilar market penetration, subject to specified limits.
Intellectual Property 
Under the terms of the Novartis Agreement, each party owns the entire right, title, and interest in and to all patents or know-how controlled by such party and existing as of or before the Novartis Effective Date, or invented, developed, created, generated or acquired solely by or on behalf of such party after the Novartis Effective Date. Subject to certain specified exceptions, any patents and know-how that are invented or otherwise developed jointly by or on behalf of the parties during the term of the Novartis Agreement and in the course of the parties’ activities under the Novartis Agreement will follow inventorship under U.S. patent law. 
Exclusivity
Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, we have agreed (a) during the Novartis Research Term, as applicable, not to conduct any internal program or program on behalf of a third party that is directed to the development or commercialization of any our capsids, or grant any third party or affiliate any right or license under our rights in such capsids, to exploit any therapeutic product containing a capsid in combination with a payload designed to have therapeutic effect on any of the Targets; and (b) after Novartis’s exercise of any Novartis License Option, not to grant 

17



any third party or affiliate any right or license under our patents to exploit any Novartis Licensed Capsid for the applicable Target.
Termination
Unless earlier terminated, the Novartis Agreement expires on the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term with respect to all Novartis Licensed Products in all countries. Subject to a cure period, either party may terminate the Novartis Agreement, in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions, in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. Novartis may also terminate the Novartis Agreement, in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions, for our insolvency, the occurrence of a violation of global trade control laws, or for our non-compliance with certain anti-bribery or anti-corruption covenants. Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement, in whole or in part, for any or no reason upon ninety days’ written notice to us.
​
Upon certain terminations for cause by Novartis, the licenses granted by us to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement shall become irrevocable and perpetual, and all milestone payments and royalties that would have otherwise been payable by Novartis under such licenses had the Novartis Agreement remained in effect would be substantially reduced.
Neurocrine Collaborations
2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement
In January 2019, we entered into the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the research, development and commercialization of certain of our AAV gene therapy products. Under the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, we agreed to collaborate on the conduct of the four 2019 Neurocrine Programs.
​
Collaboration and Licenses
Under the terms of the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, subject to the rights retained by us thereunder, we agreed to collaborate with Neurocrine on, and to grant, exclusive, royalty-bearing, non-transferable, sublicensable licenses to certain of our intellectual property rights, for all human and veterinary diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic uses, for the research, development, and commercialization of gene therapy products, which we refer to as the 2019 Collaboration Products, under (a) the VY-AADC Program, on a worldwide basis; (b) the FA Program, in the United States and, all countries in the world in which the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement remains in effect with respect to the FA Program; and (c) each 2019 Discovery Program, on a worldwide basis. Licenses related to the VY-AADC Program terminated in August 2021.
​
As a result of the June 2019 Sanofi Genzyme Termination Agreement, we gained worldwide rights to the Huntington’s disease program for VY-HTT01 and ex-U.S. rights to the FA program. We subsequently transferred the ex-U.S. rights to the FA Program to Neurocrine pursuant to the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement. To facilitate our transfer of the ex-U.S. rights to the FA Program to Neurocrine, we and Neurocrine amended the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement and we received a $5.0 million payment from Neurocrine.
​
Pursuant to development plans to be agreed by the parties, which are overseen by a joint steering committee, or JSC, we have operational responsibility, subject to certain exceptions, for the conduct of each 2019 Neurocrine Program prior to the Transition Event for each Program, as described below, and are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the 2019 Collaboration Products. Neurocrine has agreed to be responsible for all costs incurred by us in conducting these activities for each 2019 Neurocrine Program, in accordance with an agreed budget. If we breach our development responsibilities or in certain circumstances upon a change in control of us, Neurocrine has the right but not the obligation to assume the activities under such 2019 Neurocrine Program.
 ​
Upon the occurrence of a specified event for each 2019 Neurocrine Program, or a 2019 Transition Event, Neurocrine agreed to assume responsibility for development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for such 

18



2019 Neurocrine Program from us and to pay milestones and royalties on future net sales as described further below. For each Legacy Program, we were granted the option, or a 2019 Co-Co Option, to co-develop and co-commercialize such 2019 Neurocrine Program upon the occurrence of a specified event, or a 2019 Co-Co Trigger Event. We agreed, upon our exercise of a 2019 Co-Co Option, to enter into a cost- and profit-sharing arrangement with Neurocrine, or a 2019 Co-Co Agreement, and (a) jointly develop and commercialize 2019 Collaboration Products for such 2019 Neurocrine Program, or 2019 Co-Co Products, (b) share in its costs, profits and losses, and (c) forfeit certain milestones and royalties on net sales in the United States during the effective period of the applicable 2019 Co-Co Agreement. The 2019 Co-Co Option has expired, and the 2019 Transition Event and the 2019 Co-Co Trigger Event are no longer applicable, with respect to the VY-AADC Program in light of the termination of the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement with respect to the program. The remaining 2019 Transition Events are (a) with respect to the FA Program, our receipt of topline data for the initial Phase 1 clinical trial for an FA Program product candidate; and (b) with respect to each 2019 Discovery Program, the preparation by us and the approval by Neurocrine of an IND application to be filed with the FDA by Neurocrine for the first development candidate in such 2019 Discovery Program. The 2019 Co-Co Trigger Event for the FA Program is the achievement of milestones or metrics specified in the applicable development plan, as determined by the JSC.
​
Under the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, subject to exceptions specified, we and Neurocrine agreed that profits and losses under our 2019 Co-Co Option would be allocated (a) 50% to Neurocrine and 50% to us for a 2019 Collaboration Product from the VY-AADC Program and (b) 60% to Neurocrine and 40% to us for a 2019 Collaboration Product from the FA Program; provided, however, that Neurocrine would have the right to elect, within a specified period following the acceptance for filing of a biologics license application, or BLA, from the FDA, to pay a $35.0 million rate-shifting fee to us to change the allocation for the VY-AADC Program to 55% to Neurocrine and 45% to us. The parties agreed that each 2019 Co-Co Agreement would provide us the right to terminate for any reason upon prior written notice to Neurocrine and Neurocrine the right to terminate in certain circumstances upon our change of control.
​
Governance
Our research and development activities under the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement are to be conducted pursuant to plans agreed to by the parties, on a program-by-program basis, and overseen by the JSC, which is composed of an equal number of representatives from the parties. The JSC may delegate matters within its authority to subcommittees of the JSC. In addition, the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement establishes working groups to handle specified matters on a subject matter-by-subject matter basis. If a working group or subcommittee cannot agree on a matter within its purview within a specified time, such matter is to be referred sequentially to the JSC and then the executive officers of the parties. If the executive officers are not able to resolve the matter, then (a) with respect to each Legacy Program, subject to specified exceptions, (x) Neurocrine has the right to resolve such matter prior to our exercise of our 2019 Co-Co Option with regard to such 2019 Co-Co Product or if such 2019 Co-Co Option expires or goes unexercised and (y) following the timely exercise by us of our 2019 Co-Co Option, depending on the subject of such matter, either Neurocrine, in certain instances, or the parties jointly or the JSC, in other instances, would have the right to resolve such matter, and (b) with respect to 2019 Discovery Programs, subject to specified exceptions, Neurocrine has the right to resolve such matter.
Candidate Selection
The parties have committed to agree on a list of up to eight target genes, or Targets, from which Neurocrine has the right to nominate Targets for the two 2019 Discovery Programs. The Targets nominated for the 2019 Discovery Programs must be approved by a consensus of the JSC or the executive officers. 
Manufacturing
Prior to the 2019 Transition Event for a 2019 Neurocrine Program, we are responsible for the manufacture of any 2019 Collaboration Products for the 2019 Neurocrine Program. Following the Transition Event, the parties shall negotiate the manufacturing and supply responsibilities, subject to the terms of any applicable 2019 Co-Co Agreement.
​

Financial Terms
Under the terms of the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, Neurocrine has paid us an upfront payment of $115.0 million. In connection with the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, Neurocrine also paid us $50.0 million as consideration for an equity purchase of 4,179,728 shares of our common stock. The 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement provides for aggregate development milestone payments from Neurocrine to us for 2019 Collaboration Products under (a) the VY-AADC Program of up to $170.0 million, which we are no longer eligible to receive in light of the partial termination of the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement; (b) the FA Program of up to $195.0 million, and (c) each of the two 2019 Discovery Programs of up to $130.0 million per 2019 Discovery Program. We may be entitled to receive aggregate commercial milestone payments for each 2019 Collaboration Product of up to $275.0 million, subject to an aggregate cap on commercial milestone payments across all 2019 Neurocrine Programs of $1.1 billion.
​
Neurocrine has also agreed to pay us royalties, based on future net sales of the 2019 Collaboration Products. Such royalty percentages, for net sales in and outside the United States, as applicable, range (a) for the VY-AADC Program, from the mid-teens to thirty and the low-teens to twenty, respectively, which we are no longer eligible to receive in light of the partial termination of the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement; (b) for the FA Program, from the low-teens to high-teens and high-single digits to mid-teens, respectively; and (c) for each 2019 Discovery Program, from the high-single digits to mid-teens and mid-single digits to low-teens, respectively. On a country-by-country and program-by-program basis, royalty payments would commence on the first commercial sale of a 2019 Collaboration Product and terminate on the later of (x) the expiration of the last patent covering the 2019 Collaboration Product or its method of use in such country, (y) 10 years from the first commercial sale of the 2019 Collaboration Product in such country and (z) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or the 2019 Royalty Term. Royalty payments may be reduced by up to 50% in specified circumstances, including expiration of patents rights related to a 2019 Collaboration Product, approval of biosimilar products in a given country or required payment of licensing fees to third parties related to the development and commercialization of any 2019 Collaboration Product. Additionally, the licenses granted to Neurocrine shall automatically convert to fully paid-up, non-royalty bearing, perpetual, irrevocable, exclusive licenses on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the expiration of the 2019 Royalty Term applicable to such 2019 Collaboration Product in such country.
​
Intellectual Property
​
Under the terms of the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement and subject to specified exceptions therein, each party owns the entire right, title and interest in and to all intellectual property rights made solely by its employees or agents in the course of the collaboration. The parties jointly own all rights, title and interest in and to all intellectual property rights made or invented jointly by employees or agents of both parties.
​
Exclusivity
​
During the term of the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, neither party nor any of its respective affiliates is permitted to directly or indirectly exploit any AAV-based gene therapy products directed to a Target to which a 2019 Collaboration Product is directed, subject to specified exceptions, including the parties’ conduct of basic research activities.
​
Termination
Unless earlier terminated, the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement expires on the later of (a) the expiration of the last to expire 2019 Royalty Term with respect to a 2019 Collaboration Product in all countries in the relevant territory or (b) the expiration or termination of all 2019 Co-Co Agreements. Neurocrine may terminate the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a program-by-program or country-by-country basis by providing at least (x) 180-day advance notice if such notice is provided prior to the first commercial sale of the 2019 Collaboration Product to which the termination applies or (y) one-year advance notice if such notice is provided after the first commercial sale of the 2019 Collaboration Product to which the termination applies. We may terminate the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, subject to specified conditions, if Neurocrine challenges the validity or 

20



enforceability of certain of our intellectual property rights. Subject to a cure period, either party may terminate the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions. 

Upon termination in certain cases, Neurocrine has agreed to grant to us licenses to certain Neurocrine intellectual property, subject to a negotiation between the parties to establish royalty rates for use of such intellectual property. In the event of a breach by us with respect to a 2019 Neurocrine Program, if such termination were to occur after a 2019 Transition Event, then (a) if a 2019 Co-Co Agreement is in effect with respect to such program, Neurocrine can terminate the 2019 Co-Co Agreement for such program and we would no longer have co-development and co-commercialization rights with respect to the 2019 Collaboration Product and (b) subject to any license agreements, Neurocrine would no longer have any obligations with respect to any 2019 Collaboration Products resulting from such program.
​
On February 2, 2021, Neurocrine notified us that it had elected to terminate the 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement solely with regards to the VY-AADC Program, effective as of the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date. The 2019 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement remains in full force and effect for each other program thereunder. As a result of the termination, as of the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date, the license granted by us to Neurocrine thereunder regarding the VY-AADC Program expired and we regained worldwide intellectual property rights regarding the VY-AADC Program.
​
2023 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement
​
On January 8, 2023, we entered into the 2023 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of the 2023 Neurocrine Programs. 
​
Collaboration and License
​
Under the 2023 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, we and Neurocrine have agreed to collaborate on the conduct of the 2023 Neurocrine Programs. The 2023 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement became effective upon the expiration of all applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which occurred on February 21, 2023, or the Neurocrine Effective Date. Under the terms of the 2023 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, subject to the rights retained by us thereunder, we granted to Neurocrine, as of the Neurocrine Effective Date, an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license, under certain of our intellectual property rights, to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize gene therapy products, or the 2023 Collaboration Products, arising under the 2023 Neurocrine Programs.

Pursuant to mutually-agreed development plans, during the period beginning on the Neurocrine Effective Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Neurocrine Effective Date, which period may be extended upon mutual written agreement of us and Neurocrine, or the 2023 Discovery Period, and as overseen by the JSC that oversees our ongoing collaboration with Neurocrine, we are responsible for identifying capsids meeting target criteria, producing development candidates, and conducting other non-clinical activities regarding the 2023 Collaboration Products. Neurocrine has agreed to be responsible for all costs we incur in conducting non-clinical development activities for each 2023 Neurocrine Program, in accordance with an agreed budget. If we breach our development responsibilities or, in certain circumstances, upon a change of control, Neurocrine has the right, but not the obligation, to assume the conduct of our activities under such 2023 Neurocrine Program.

We have been granted the option, or a 2023 Co-Co Option, to co-develop and co-commercialize 2023 Collaboration Products in the GBA1 Program in the United States upon the occurrence of a specified event, or a 2023 Co-Co Trigger Event. Should we elect to exercise our 2023 Co-Co Option, we and Neurocrine agree to enter into a cost- and profit-sharing arrangement, or a 2023 Co-Co Agreement, whereby we and Neurocrine agree to jointly develop and commercialize 2023 Collaboration Products in the GBA1 Program, or 2023 Co-Co Products, in the United States and share equally in the GBA1 Program’s costs, profits and losses in the United States, with each party entitled to or responsible for 50% of profits and losses with respect to each 2023 Co-Co Product in the United States, subject to specified exceptions. The parties have agreed that the 2023 Co-Co Agreement will provide us the right to terminate the 

21



2023 Co-Co Agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to Neurocrine and provide Neurocrine the right to terminate or amend the 2023 Co-Co Agreement upon a change of control under certain circumstances. In the event we exercise our 2023 Co-Co Option, the parties have also agreed that Neurocrine is entitled to receive (in addition to its 50% share of profits) 50% of our share of profits until our obligation to repay 50% of all development costs incurred by Neurocrine in connection with the GBA1 Program prior to such exercise have been paid off out of such 50% of our share of profits. The 2023 Co-Co Trigger Event is the date on which we receive topline data from the first Phase 1 clinical trial for a product candidate being developed pursuant to the GBA1 Program.
​
Governance
​
Our research and development activities under the 2023 Collaboration Agreement are to be conducted pursuant to plans agreed to by the parties, on a 2023 Neurocrine Program-by-2023 Neurocrine Program basis, and overseen by the JSC, which is composed of an equal number of representatives from each of us and Neurocrine. The JSC may delegate matters within its authority to subcommittees of the JSC. In addition, the 2023 Collaboration Agreement establishes working groups to handle specified matters on a subject matter-by-subject matter basis. If a working group or subcommittee cannot agree on a matter within its purview within a specified time, such matter is to be referred sequentially to the JSC and then the executive officers of the parties. If the executive officers are not able to resolve the matter, then (a) with respect to the GBA1 Program, subject to specified exceptions, (x) Neurocrine has the right to resolve such matter prior to our exercise of our 2023 Co-Co Option for the GBA1 Program or in the event we elect not to exercise our 2023 Co-Co Option, and (y) following the exercise by us of our 2023 Co-Co Option for the GBA1 Program, depending on the subject of such matter, either Neurocrine, in certain instances, or the parties jointly or the JSC, in other instances, would have the right to resolve such matter, and (b) with respect to the 2023 Discovery Programs, subject to specified exceptions, Neurocrine has the right to decide any unresolved matters relating to a 2023 Discovery Program that are within the JSC’s authority.
​
Candidate Selection
​
Either party may notify the JSC of any gene therapy product candidate that includes a Voyager capsid and a payload that is being developed under a 2023 Neurocrine Program, or a Collaboration Candidate, that it desires to nominate as a development candidate. In such event, the JSC shall determine whether such nominated Collaboration Candidate meets certain development criteria. There will be a maximum of four potential development candidates for which development is being performed under any 2023 Neurocrine Program at any given time during the 2023 Discovery Period. If a Collaboration Candidate fails to meet criteria established by the JSC and is removed from consideration to become a development candidate or is named a development candidate, then a new Collaboration Candidate may be nominated to be a potential development candidate to replace the Collaboration Candidate that has failed or succeeded such that not more than four potential development candidates per program are under consideration at any one time during the 2023 Discovery Period.
​
Manufacturing
​
The parties have agreed that the applicable development plans shall specify the allocation between us and Neurocrine of responsibilities for the manufacturing of Collaboration Candidates associated with the applicable 2023 Neurocrine Program during the 2023 Discovery Period. In accordance with the 2023 Collaboration Agreement, the parties have also agreed that, if we conduct any portion of the manufacturing of a Collaboration Candidate, the applicable development plan shall include an obligation for us to assist with the technology transfer of such manufacturing responsibilities to Neurocrine or a third-party contract manufacturing organization, as reasonably requested by Neurocrine, on terms to be mutually-agreed by us and Neurocrine. Following the end of the 2023 Discovery Period, Neurocrine shall be responsible for the manufacturing of all Collaboration Candidates and products
​
Financial Terms
​
Under the terms of the 2023 Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, Neurocrine paid us an upfront payment of approximately $136.0 million and approximately $39.0 million as consideration for an equity purchase of 4,395,588 shares of our common stock in February 2023. The 2023 Collaboration Agreement provides for aggregate development 

22



milestone payments from Neurocrine to us for 2023 Collaboration Products under (a) the GBA1 Program of up to $985.0 million; and (b) each of the three 2023 Discovery Programs of up to $175.0 million for each 2023 Discovery Program. We may be entitled to receive aggregate commercial milestone payments for up to two 2023 Collaboration Products under the GBA1 Program of up to $950.0 million per 2023 Collaboration Product and for one 2023 Collaboration Product under each 2023 Discovery Program of up to $275.0 million per 2023 Discovery Program.

Neurocrine has also agreed to pay us tiered royalties, based on future net sales of the 2023 Collaboration Products. Such royalty percentages, for net sales in and outside the United States, range from (a) for the GBA1 Program, the low double-digits to twenty and the high single-digits to mid-teens, respectively, and (b) for each 2023 Discovery Program, high single-digits to mid-teens and mid-single digits to low double-digits, respectively.

Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop into products and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our gene therapy platform, product programs, product candidates and scientific expertise in the fields of gene therapy and neuroscience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. 
We are aware of several companies focused on developing AAV gene therapies in various indications, including AavantiBio, Inc. (acquired by Solid Biosciences, Inc., or Solid), Abeona Therapeutics, Inc., Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc., Aevitas Therapeutics, Inc., Akuous, Inc. (acquired by Eli Lilly and Company, or Eli Lilly), Alcyone Therapeutics, Inc., Amicus Therapeutics, Inc., Apic Bio, Inc., Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation (acquired by Syncona Limited), Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc., or AskBio (acquired by Bayer), Audentes Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Astellas Pharma Inc.), Biogen, Inc., or Biogen, Brain Neurotherapy Bio, Inc. (merged with AskBio), BioMarin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Encoded Therapeutics, Inc., GenSight Biologics SA, Homology Medicines, Inc., LEXEO Therapeutics, Inc., LogicBio Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by AstraZeneca), Lysogene SA, MeiraGTx Ltd., or MeiraGTx, Neurogene, Inc., Novartis Gene Therapies, Inc. (formerly AveXis, Inc.), Passage Bio, Inc., Pfizer, Inc., Prevail Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Eli Lilly), PTC Therapeutics, Inc., or PTC, REGENXBio Inc., Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., Solid, Spark Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Roche), StrideBio, Inc., Taysha Gene Therapies, Inc. and uniQure, as well as several companies addressing other methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. Any advances in gene therapy technology made by a competitor may be used to develop therapies that could compete against any of our product candidates.

25



We expect that our TRACER discovery platform and preclinical programs will compete with a variety of therapies in development, including:

● | Our TRACER discovery platform will potentially compete with a variety of companies developing AAV capsids, including: 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Inc., Affinia Therapeutics Inc., Apertura Gene Therapy, LLC, Capsida Biotherapeutics, Inc., Capsigen Inc., Dyno Therapeutics, Inc., Kate Therapeutics, Inc., Shape Therapeutics Inc., and StrideBio, Inc.;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our program for diseases linked to GBA1 mutations will potentially compete with AAV gene therapies being developed by Prevail Therapeutics Inc. (acquired by Eli Lilly), Freeline Therapeutics Holdings plc, Pfizer, Biogen, Lysogene SA, and Coave Therapeutics SA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our program for tauopathies including AD, progressive supranuclear palsy, and frontotemporal dementia will potentially compete with tau antibodies being developed by Roche Genentech Inc. in collaboration with AC Immune SA, Eli Lilly, AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd, AbbVie Ireland Unlimited Company, Biogen, Eisai Co., Ltd., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., UCB S.A., and several other companies, as well as an antisense oligonucleotide program being developed by Ionis in collaboration with Biogen;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our program for a monogenic form of ALS will potentially compete with Tofersen being developed by Biogen, in collaboration with Ionis, and gene therapies being developed by Novartis Gene Therapies, Inc. and Apic Bio, Inc.; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our FA Program will potentially compete with AAV gene therapies being developed by LEXEO Therapeutics, Inc., AavantiBio, Inc. (acquired by Solid), PTC, StrideBio, Inc. in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Pfizer, and Novartis Gene Therapies, Inc.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of product candidates and commercializing those product candidates. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for product candidates and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ product candidates may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new product candidates enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any product candidates that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

Manufacturing 
The manufacture of gene therapy products is technically complex, and necessitates substantial expertise and capital investment. Production difficulties caused by unforeseen events may delay the availability of material for our clinical studies. To meet the requirements of our current and planned future trials we have developed a proprietary manufacturing platform that provides a robust and scalable process for AAV production. We are using HEK 293 cell manufacturing to support our preclinical research activities. We also have expertise with the baculovirus/Sf9 AAV production system, a technology for producing AAV vectors at scale in insect-derived cells, which we have used for our clinical development activities in the past and may use in the future for clinical development activities. We focus on developing internal processes and capabilities to produce high-yield and high-quality gene therapies. Both the HEK 293 cell manufacturing process and the baculovirus/Sf9 manufacturing process have been successfully transferred to our contract manufacturing organizations. The baculovirus/Sf9 manufacturing process has been used by our contract manufacturing organizations in manufacturing of clinical materials in accordance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. We have also built an onsite, state-of-the-art process research and development facility to enable the manufacturing of high quality AAV gene therapy vectors at research scale.
We presently contract with third parties for the manufacturing of our program materials. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners is relatively cost-efficient and we believe that it eliminates the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development. Although we expect to rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with manufacturing and quality experience to oversee our contract manufacturers.
Intellectual Property
Overview 
We strive to protect the proprietary technology, inventions, and know-how to enhance improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology platform, on continuing technological innovation and on in-licensing opportunities to develop, improve and maintain the strength of our position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other protections for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and intellectual property rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third-party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
We own at least 390 pending patent applications and at least 54 patents have issued in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We co-own at least 43 pending patent applications and at least 10 patents have issued from these co-owned families in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. At least 12 patent applications have been filed and are pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions by or on behalf of universities which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. To date, at least 44 patents have issued to our licensors which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. To date, at least 148 patents have issued to our licensors which have granted us non-exclusive license rights to the technology with at least 68 applications pending. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek United States and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including: AAV-

27



based biological products and constructs, methods of delivering said AAV-based biological products and constructs, methods of treating diseases of interest, as well as methods of engineering and manufacturing of the same. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel biological products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various other license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development.

U.S. Biological Products Development Process 
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates gene therapy products as biological products, or biologics. These products are licensed for marketing under the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. A company, institution, or organization which takes responsibility for the initiation and management of a clinical development program for such products, and for their regulatory approval, is typically referred to as a sponsor.
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to the FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation of clinical trial material in accordance with cGMPs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | design of a clinical protocol and submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity, potency, and efficacy, of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies, including payment of application user fees;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection prior to BLA approval of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA Advisory Committee meeting to elicit expert input on critical issues and including a vote by external Committee members;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
Before a sponsor begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, 

32



formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. These studies are generally referred to as IND-enabling studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are typically referred to as IND-enabling studies. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
The IND and IRB Processes
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. An IND must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA or BLA. In support of a request for an IND, sponsors must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial may proceed. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a partial clinical hold might state that a specific protocol or part of a protocol may not proceed, while other parts of a protocol or other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after the imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following the issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, a clinical investigation may only resume once the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed or recommence. Occasionally, clinical holds are imposed due to manufacturing issues that may present safety issues for the clinical study subjects.
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all IND requirements must be met unless waived by the FDA. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including undergoing review and receiving approval by an independent ethics committee and seeking and receiving informed consent from subjects. GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data.
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB, which must operate in compliance with FDA regulations, must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects and must monitor the trial until completed. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on review of available data from the study, to which only the 

33



DSMB maintains access. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of a clinical trial can occur if the DSMB determines that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
Human Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before they participate in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval.
Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population, which may be healthy volunteers or subjects with the target disease, to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the product candidate’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. 
Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled and closely monitored. 
Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken using a larger patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a new biologic product. Such Phase 3 clinical trials are referred to as “pivotal” trials. 
A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Moreover, as noted above, a pivotal trial is a clinical trial that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal trials, to support regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.
In December 2022, with the passage of Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, Congress required sponsors to develop and submit a diversity action plan for each Phase 3 clinical trial or any other “pivotal study” of a new drug or biological product. These plans are meant to encourage the enrollment of more diverse patient populations in late-stage clinical trials of FDA-regulated products. Specifically, actions plans must include the sponsor’s goals for enrollment, the underlying rationale for those goals, and an explanation of how the sponsor intends to meet them. In addition to these requirements, the legislation directs the FDA to issue new guidance on diversity action plans.

34



In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA or BLA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials, typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials, such as to verify clinical benefit in the case of products approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting mandatory Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of FDA approval for products.
Finally, sponsors of clinical trials are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH. In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. The NIH’s Final Rule on registration and reporting requirements for clinical trials became effective in 2017. Although the FDA has historically not enforced these reporting requirements due to a long delay by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, in issuing final implementing regulations, the FDA has issued several Notices of Noncompliance to manufacturers since April 2021. The failure to submit clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov, as required, is a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues.
Gene Therapy Products
We expect that the procedures and standards applied to gene therapy products will be applied to any product candidates we may develop. The FDA has defined a gene therapy product as one that seeks to modify or manipulate the expression of a gene or to alter the biological properties of living cells for therapeutic use. The products may be used to modify cells in vivo or transferred to cells ex vivo prior to administration to the recipient. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, or OTAT, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. The NIH, including the NExTRAC also advises the FDA on gene therapy issues and other issues related to emerging biotechnologies. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols.
The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, including final guidance documents released in January 2020 relating to chemistry, manufacturing and controls information for gene therapy INDs, long-term follow-up after the administration of gene therapy products, gene therapies for rare diseases and gene therapies for retinal disorders, as well as draft guidance in January 2021 for Human Gene Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases. Although the FDA has indicated that these and other guidance documents it previously issued are not legally binding, compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any gene therapy product candidate. The guidance documents provide additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe for potential delayed adverse effects in participants who have received investigational gene therapies with the duration of follow-up based on the potential for risk of such effects. For AAV vectors specifically, the FDA typically recommends that sponsors continue to monitor participants for potential gene therapy-related adverse events for up to a five-year period.
Until 2019, most gene therapy clinical trials in the United States required pre-review by the predecessor of NExTRAC before being approved by the IRBs and any local biosafety boards or being allowed to proceed by the FDA. In 2019, the NIH substantially eliminated the pre-review process and going forward, the review of gene therapy clinical trial protocols would be largely handled by local IRBs and institutional biosafety committees, or IBCs, in addition to the FDA. Furthermore, in 2019, the NIH removed from public access the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System database, which previously contained substantial amounts of safety and other participant information regarding human gene therapy trials performed up to that time.

35



Manufacturing and Other Regulatory Requirements
Concurrently with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the finished product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Specifically, the FDA’s regulations require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceuticals are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and they are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements. The PREVENT Pandemics Act, which was enacted in December 2022, clarifies that foreign drug manufacturing establishments are subject to registration and listing requirements even if a drug or biologic undergoes further manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing at a separate establishment outside of the United States prior to being imported or offered for import into the United States. Inspections must follow a “risk-based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. The FDA’s regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved product.
Submission of a BLA to the FDA
FDA approval is required before any new gene therapy product or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved gene therapy product, can be marketed in the United States. Thus, assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational gene therapy product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee unless an exception or waiver applies, such as the first application filed by a small business or BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate includes an indication that is not for a rare disease or condition.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all applications within 60 days of receipt and must inform the sponsor at that time or before whether an application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. In pertinent part, FDA’s regulations state that an application “shall not be considered as filed until all pertinent information and data have been received” by the FDA. In the event that FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the sponsor. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted.
If the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review the BLA, within ten months for a standard review, or, if the BLA relates to an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition, perform a priority review, within six months. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the sponsor to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an application to extend beyond the PDUFA target action date.

36



The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.

In connection with its review of a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. With passage of FDORA, Congress clarified the FDA’s authority to conduct inspections by expressly permitting inspection of facilities involved in the preparation, conduct, or analysis of clinical and non-clinical studies submitted to the FDA as well as other persons holding study records or involved in the study process. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, a sponsor must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
The FDA’s Decision on a BLA
The FDA reviews an application to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use(s), with the latter determination being made on the basis of substantial evidence. The FDA has interpreted this evidentiary standard to require at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations to establish the efficacy of a new product. Under certain circumstances, however, FDA has indicated that a single trial with certain characteristics and additional information may satisfy this standard. After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendations, if any, and inspection reports of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA will issue either a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, or an approval letter. To reach this determination, the FDA must determine that the expected benefits of the proposed product outweigh its potential risks to patients.



A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time- consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor will have one year to respond to the deficiencies identified by the FDA, at which time the FDA can deem the application withdrawn or, in its discretion, grant the sponsor an additional six-month extension to respond. For those seeking to challenge the FDA’s CRL decision, the FDA has indicated that sponsors may request a formal hearing on the CRL or they may file a request for reconsideration or a request for a formal dispute resolution.
An approval letter, on the other hand, authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. That is, the approval will be limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the FDA-approved labeling. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

37



Post-Approval Requirements
Gene therapy products manufactured or distributed pursuant to regulatory approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the regulatory authorities, including, among other things, requirements relating to formal commitments for post approval clinical trials and studies, manufacturing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior regulatory authority review and approval.
Manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities and country or state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior regulatory approval before being implemented. Regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Further, although physicians may prescribe legally available products for unapproved uses or patient populations, which are commonly referred to as “off-label uses,” manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the FDA will consider in determining the intended use of a biologic. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the HHS, as well as state authorities.
It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. Moreover, with passage of the Pre-Approval Information Exchange Act, or PIE Act, in December 2022, sponsors of products that have not been approved may proactively communicate to payors certain information about products in development to help expedite patient access upon product approval. Previously, such communications were permitted under FDA guidance, but the new legislation explicitly provides protection to sponsors who convey certain information about products in development to payors, including unapproved uses of approved products.
Expedited Review Programs
The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of applications in several ways. None of these expedited programs, however, changes the standards for approval but each may help expedite the development or approval process governing product candidates.

● | Fast Track Designation. Candidate products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track application before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

38




● | Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to ten months for standard review.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accelerated approval. Biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials. With passage of FDORA in December 2022, Congress modified certain provisions governing accelerated approval of drug and biologic products. Specifically, the new legislation authorized the FDA to: require a sponsor to have its confirmatory clinical trial underway before accelerated approval is awarded, require a sponsor of a product granted accelerated approval to submit progress reports on its post-approval studies to the FDA every six months until the study is completed; and use expedited procedures to withdraw accelerated approval of an NDA or BLA after the confirmatory trial fails to verify the product candidate’s clinical benefit. Further, FDORA requires the FDA to publish on its website “the rationale for why a post-approval study is not appropriate or necessary” whenever it decides not to require such a study upon granting accelerated approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regenerative advanced therapy. With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.

U.S. Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
A gene therapy product may qualify for orphan drug designation, or ODD, under the Orphan Drug Act, if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. ODD entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. ODD does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
If a gene therapy product that has ODD receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same gene therapy product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as not being able to supply the product for patients or showing clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of a different gene therapy for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan-drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for 

39



seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same gene therapy as defined by the FDA. In September 2021, the FDA issued final guidance describing its current thinking on when a gene therapy product is the “same” as another product for purposes of orphan exclusivity. Under the guidance, if either the transgene or vector differs between two gene therapy products in a manner that does not reflect “minor” differences, the two products would be considered different drugs for orphan drug exclusivity purposes. The FDA will determine whether two vectors from the same viral class are the same on a case-by-case basis and may consider additional key features in assessing the sameness.

In September 2021, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that, for the purpose of determining the scope of market exclusivity, the term “same disease or condition” in the statute means the designated “rare disease or condition” and could not be interpreted by the FDA to mean the “indication or use.” Thus, the court concluded, orphan drug exclusivity applies to the entire designated disease or condition rather than the “indication or use.” Although there have been legislative proposals to overrule this decision, they have not been enacted into law. On January 23, 2023, the FDA announced that, in matters beyond the scope of that court order, the FDA will continue to apply its existing regulations tying orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which the orphan drug was approved.
Orphan drug products are also eligible for Rare Pediatric Disease Designation if greater than 50% of patients living with the disease are under age 18. A priority review voucher, or PRV, will be given to the sponsor of a product with a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation at the time of product approval that is transferable to another company. A PRV is a voucher that the FDA issues to a sponsor of a rare pediatric disease or tropical disease product application at the time of the marketing application approval. Vouchers are transferable to other sponsors that may apply it to their new drug applications or BLAs. A PRV entitles the holder to designate a single human drug application submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA or Section 351 of the PHSA as qualifying for a priority review. An FDA priority review may expedite the review process of a marketing application reducing the review time from ten months after formal acceptance of the file to six months after formal acceptance of the file. Applying the PRV to a marketing application does not ensure the FDA’s approval of the marketing application and all requirements supporting the safety and efficacy of the product must be met.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
When a biological product is licensed for marketing by FDA with approval of a BLA, the product may be entitled to certain types of market and data exclusivity barring FDA from approving competing products for certain periods of time. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, was enacted in the United States and included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars and several interchangeable biosimilar products. In December 2022, Congress clarified through FDORA that the FDA may approve multiple first interchangeable biosimilar biological products so long as the products are all approved on the first day on which such a product is approved as interchangeable with the reference product. 
A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. Approval of a 351(k) application may not be made effective until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, which under the statute excludes the date of licensure of supplements and certain other applications. Additionally, a 351(k) application for a biosimilar or interchangeable biological product cannot be submitted for review until four years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed under section 351(a) of the PHSA. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, however, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. There have been recent government proposals to reduce the twelve-year reference product exclusivity period, but none has been enacted to date. At the same time, since passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, which address pharmacy practices involving biosimilar products.

U.S. Patent Term Restoration
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, less any time the sponsor failed to act with due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
Other Healthcare Laws 
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we will be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states in which we conduct our business, if and when our product candidates are approved by the FDA and subject to federal healthcare reimbursement. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of biologic products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for medical products and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for pharmaceutical products under government healthcare programs. The ACA is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government healthcare programs. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which will remain in effect through 2031 pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or 

41



CARES Act. These Medicare sequester reductions were reduced and suspended through the end of June 2022, with the full 2% cut resuming thereafter. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was enacted in January 2013, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. Indeed, under current legislation, the actual reductions in Medicare payments may vary up to 4%.
Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. Further, on December 14, 2018, a United States District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the TJCA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The United States Supreme Court heard this case on November 10, 2020 and, on June 17, 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
Although the previous administration took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA, those actions were rescinded with issuance of an Executive Order on January 28, 2021 by President Biden, which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this Executive Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents.
Pharmaceutical Price Reform
The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent United States congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020, President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries’ access to evidence-based care.
In addition, in October 2020, HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription products from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of products from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The final rule would eliminate the current safe harbor for Medicare drug rebates and create new safe harbors for beneficiary point-of-sale discounts and pharmacy benefit manager service fees. It originally was set to go into effect on January 1, 

42



2022, but with passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, it has been delayed by Congress to January 1, 2032.
On July 9, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of pharmaceuticals. To address these costs, the executive order directs HHS to create a plan within 45 days to combat “excessive pricing of prescription drugs and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such drugs, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.” Thereafter, on September 9, 2021, HHS released its plan to reduce drug prices. The key features of that plan are to: (a) make drug prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers and throughout the health care system by supporting drug price negotiations with manufacturers; (b) improve and promote competition throughout the prescription drug industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase transparency; and (c) foster scientific innovation to promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments.

More recently, on August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law by President Biden. The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D, which is a program available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. 
Specifically, with respect to price negotiations, Congress authorized Medicare to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-source drug and biologic products that do not have competing generics or biosimilars and are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. CMS may negotiate prices for ten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in 2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and beyond. This provision applies to drug products that have been approved for at least 9 years and biologics that have been licensed for 13 years, but it does not apply to drugs and biologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition. Further, the legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also requires manufacturers to pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an estimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at $2,000 a year.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription product and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
Additional Regulation 
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our 

43



operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials, e.g., a clinical trial application for each clinical trial for each EU country in which the trial is conducted; a clinical trial notification is required in Japan. 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
