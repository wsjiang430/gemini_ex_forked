Business Operations
 
Overview
 
In 2003, Isoray obtained clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of Cesium-131 (Cesium-131) radioisotope in the treatment of all malignant tumors. As of the date of this Report, such applications include prostate cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gynecological cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, ocular melanoma and pancreatic cancer. The brachytherapy seed form (a sealed source) of Cesium-131 may be used in surface, interstitial and intra-cavity applications for tumors with known radio-sensitivity. Management believes the combination of a short half-life and relatively high-energy of Cesium-131 will allow it to become a leader in the brachytherapy market, and Cesium-131 represents the first major advancement in brachytherapy technology in approximately 30 years with attributes that could make it the long-term “seed of choice” for internal radiation therapy procedures.
 
The Company’s core product is its Cesium-131 sealed source brachytherapy “seed.” These seeds can be inserted individually or in combination into various locations in the body until the physician is satisfied with the radiation dose delivered. The Company also sells seeds in strands to keep them from individually moving and to allow the physician to put multiple seeds in a row as desired. In addition, “pre-loaded” needles may have Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds inserted in them, or a strand with seeds in the strand, inserted into the needle. Seeds can be sold with our Blu Build™ loading device that allows clinicians to efficiently configure strands in the operating room. Seeds can also be loaded into suture material, which can be sewn by Isoray into a piece of bio-absorbable mesh which can be sewn or stapled into tissue by the physician for use in lung, pelvic floor and other cancer locations. Under a manufacturing agreement for GT Medical Technologies, Inc. (“GT Med Tech”), Isoray inserts Cesium-131 seeds into a collagen matrix which GT Med Tech’s customers place in the brain.
 
Brachytherapy seeds are small devices containing a therapeutic dose of radiation used in an interstitial radiation procedure. The procedure has become one of the primary treatments for prostate cancer. The brachytherapy procedure places radioactive seeds as close as possible to (in or near) the cancerous tumor (the word “brachytherapy” is derived from Greek and means close therapy). A primary advantage of seed brachytherapy is the ability of the seeds to deliver therapeutic radiation thereby killing the cancerous tumor cells while minimizing exposure (damage) to adjacent healthy tissue. This procedure allows doctors to administer a higher dose of radiation directly to the tumor. A seed contains a radioisotope sealed within a titanium capsule. The number of seeds used varies based on the size of the cancerous area being treated, the isotope used and the activity level specified by the physician. When brachytherapy is combined with another treatment method (dual-therapy), fewer seeds are used in the procedure. The isotope decays over time (half-life) and eventually the seeds become inert (typically over 6 half-lives). The seeds may be used as a primary treatment (monotherapy) or as an adjunct therapy with other treatment modalities, or as treatment for residual disease after excision of primary tumors. The number of seeds for treatment sites vary widely (as few as 8 seeds to more than 100 seeds) depending on the type of cancer, the tumor location, the prescribed activity level and any additional type of therapy being utilized.

In the cases of lung and brain tumors (and other solid tumors), a surgeon will remove the tumor if it is medically prudent and this offers the patient some benefit in terms of controlling the growth of the cancer or its symptoms. In many cases, radiation therapy is added following the surgery; this is known as “adjuvant” radiation therapy. The Company believes that its form of adjuvant radiation therapy deployable in such cases offers advantages over external beam methods. However, external beam holds the vast majority of the market for adjuvant radiation therapy.
 
Prostate Cancer
 
Isoray began the production and sales of Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds in October 2004 for the treatment of prostate cancer after receiving clearance of its premarket notification (510(k)) by the Food and Drug Administration. Prostate cancer treatment represents over 85% of the business of Isoray today.
 
When brachytherapy is the only treatment (monotherapy) used in the prostate, approximately 70 to 120 seeds are permanently implanted in the prostate during an outpatient procedure. Typically, physicians use loose seeds in needles or in a cartridge or seeds loaded into strands which can also be loaded into needles for the treatment of prostate cancer. Seeds may be combined with another treatment method (dual therapy) when treating prostate cancer.
 
In late 2017, the first report with long-term follow-up clinical outcomes for patients treated with Cesium-131 brachytherapy for low-risk patients was presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Therapeutic Radiation Oncology.
 
Moran, B. J. and M. H. Braccioforte (2017). Long-term PSA outcomes in a single institution, prospective randomized 131-Cs/125-I permanent prostate brachytherapy trial. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 99(2 (Suppl)): E255. In this randomized study of 140 patients no statistically significant difference in biochemical failure was seen with long-term follow-up between the Cesium-131 group and the group implanted with I-125.
 
In addition to the long-term cancer control data mentioned above, a report from 2017 describes favorable long-term quality of life outcomes following Cesium-131 brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer (S.M. Glaser, et al. (2017), Long-Term Quality of Life in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Cesium-131, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 98(5):1053-1058). 
 
The Company continues to identify and support work that seeks to employ and study Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds in combination with external beam radiation therapy (“EBRT”). Compelling evidence is emerging supporting the use of such combination brachytherapy and EBRT in intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer cases. (Sylvester J, Braccioforte M.H., Moran B.J. (2019) Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) followed by cesium-131 brachytherapy for intermediate and high risk localized prostate cancer. Brachytherapy 18(3):S72).
 
For low-risk prostate cancer, studies are ongoing to evaluate the use of Cesium-131 in “focal,” or sub-total brachytherapy of the prostate. It is hypothesized that low-risk patients using focal brachytherapy may achieve rates of prostate cancer control comparable to that of full gland treatment while significantly reducing side effects. (M.H. Mendez, et al., Current trends and new frontiers in focal therapy for localized prostate cancer, Current Urology Report 16, 35 (June 2015)).
 
Early results from a series of men treated with Cesium-131 focal therapy were presented at the 2018 Annual Meeting of the American Brachytherapy Society, Kalash, R., et al., (2018), Focal brachytherapy using Cesium-131 in low-risk prostate cancer. Brachytherapy 17 (Suppl):S89. The authors conclude that, while too early to estimate disease specific outcomes, serum PSAs in these men had declined in the short term and there was no residual effect on urinary, bowel or erectile symptoms.

Gynecologic Cancer
 
Individual seeds can also be placed via needle into the female reproductive tract for the treatment of various gynecologic cancers. This effort has been led by Dr. Jonathan Feddock, formerly of the University of Kentucky, and currently of Baptist Health Lexington. In June 2016, Dr. Feddock conducted two presentations on gynecological cancer patients who underwent treatment with permanent implantation of Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds. In the first presentation, it was noted that 21 out of 26 recurrent cancer patients remained visually free of cancer at a median of 14 months after implantation which equates to 80.7% local control (J. Feddock, et al., Permanent interstitial re-irradiation with cesium-131: a highly successful second chance for cure in recurrent pelvic malignancies, Brachytherapy 15 (S1)S78-9 (2016)). In the second presentation, a series of 22 women with pelvic cancer underwent Cesium-131 brachytherapy seed implantation with other forms of radiation therapy treating patients who were recently diagnosed and had not yet undergone any treatment. All these cancers were successfully controlled at a median follow-up of 16 months. Side effects using the Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds were minor and all treatments were performed as outpatient procedures. (J. Feddock, et al., Outpatient interstitial implants - integrating cesium-131 permanent interstitial brachytherapy into definitive treatment for gynecologic malignancies, Brachytherapy 15 (S1):S93-4 (2016)). Dr. Feddock supplemented his prior publication with a presentation at the American Brachytherapy Society 2018 meeting describing a combination technique of Cesium-131 plus external beam radiation therapy for patients with advanced vaginal melanoma. The group concluded that this small series of five patients demonstrated the treatment to be "effective initial treatment" with a "favorable toxicity profile" (J. Feddock, et al. Permanent interstitial brachytherapy (PIB) using cesium-131 in vaginal melanoma – a new wide-local radiation technique. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 102(3S); E281 (2016)).
 
The FDA clearance granted in August 2009 permits loading Cesium-131 seeds into bio-absorbable braided sutures or “braided strands” giving the Company the ability to treat brain, lung, head and neck, colorectal, and chest wall cancers. The Company is currently pursuing the brain, head and neck, and lung cancer applications in addition to its primary focus on prostate cancer.
Brain Cancer
 
Stranded Cesium-131 Sources
 
Starting in 2012, multiple institutions began utilizing Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds loaded in braided strands for treatment of a variety of brain cancers. The application of Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds loaded in braided strands to date has been primarily in salvage cases as a re-treatment for metastatic brain cancers where aggressive tumors had reoccurred following standard of care treatment.
 
From 2014 to present there have been numerous published abstracts and society presentations which have been presented and support the effectiveness of treating recurrent metastatic brain cancers with stranded Cesium-131. Dr. Gabriella Wernicke and co-investigators at Weill Cornell Medical College at the NY Presbyterian Hospital have published multiple papers on the efficacy, favorable side-effect profile and cost-effectiveness of Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds in the treatment of metastatic brain cancer. (A. G. Wernicke, et al., Clinical Outcomes of Large Brain Metastases Treated With Neurosurgical Resection and Intraoperative Cesium-131 Brachytherapy: Results of a Prospective Trial, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 98 (5):1059-1068 (2017); A. Pham, et al., Neurocognitive function and quality of life in patients with newly diagnosed brain metastasis after treatment with intra-operative cesium-131 brachytherapy: a prospective trial, J Neurooncol 127(1):63-71 (2016); A.G. Wernicke, et al., Surgical technique and clinically relevant resection cavity dynamics following implantation of cesium-131 brachytherapy in patients with brain metastases, Operative Neurosurgery 12(1):49-60 (2016); A.G. Wernicke, et al., Cesium-131 brachytherapy for recurrent brain metastases: durable salvage treatment for previously irradiated metastatic disease, J Neurosurg DOI: 10.3171/2016.3.JNS152836 (Published online June 3, 2016); A.G. Wernicke, et al., The cost-effectiveness of surgical resection and cesium-131 intraoperative brachytherapy versus surgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of metastatic brain tumors, J Neurooncol 127(1):145-53 (2016)).
 
GammaTile™ Treatment for Brain Cancer
 
During fiscal 2013, the Company began providing technical assistance and selling Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds for embedding in collagen tiles by physicians at Barrow Neurological Institute (Barrow) to treat malignant meningioma, primary brain cancers and metastases of cancers to the brain. These physicians from Barrow formed a company, GammaTile LLC, now GT Medical Technologies, Inc. (“GT Med Tech”), and further refined this technology which integrates Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds and has resulted in the issuance of multiple patents to GT Med Tech for the treatment of brain cancers.
 
In fiscal 2019 a paper was published in the Journal of Neurosurgery describing outcomes of patients who had experienced multiple reoccurrences of a tumor type known as meningioma following previous surgeries in conjunction with external beam radiation. Following treatment with Cesium-131, 90% of the treated tumors had no evidence of regrowth at the operative site (local control). The incidence of radiation necrosis, a side effect to the brain from Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds (a common side effect) occurred in only 2 of the 20 treatments. (D. Brachman, et al. Resection and permanent intracranial brachytherapy using modular, biocompatible cesium-131 implants: result in 20 recurrent, previously irradiated meningiomas. Journal of Neurosurgery December 2018).
 
This same group has presented clinical studies of GammaTile™ in the treatment of other brain cancers.

In June 2019 Dr. David Brachman presented to the American Brachytherapy Society in Miami a series of patients experiencing the recurrence of a variety of brain cancers including meningiomas, high grade gliomas, and brain metastases.  (Brachman D., Youssef E., Dardis C., et al. Surgically Targeted Radiation Therapy: Safety Profile of Collagen Tile Brachytherapy in 79 Recurrent, Previously Irradiated Intracranial Neoplasms on a Prospective Clinical Trial. Brachytherapy 18(S3):S35 (2019.) Dr. Brachman, who was awarded the Judith Stittman Best Abstract Award for this work, described GammaTile™ therapy utilizing Cesium-131 as having an excellent safety profile that “could help expand treatment options for this difficult cohort of patients”. This work is important because recurrence of these hard-to-treat brain cancers leaves patients with very limited options due to their prior radiation treatments.
 
Earlier, in November of 2016, Dr. Emad Youssef of the Barrow Neurological Institute presented a study conducted on 13 patients with recurrent high grade gliomas (primary brain cancer) at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuro-Oncology meeting. (E. Youssef, et al; Rthp-23. Cs131 Implants For Salvage Therapy Of Recurrent High Grade Gliomas (Hgg), Neuro-Oncology Volume 18, Issue suppl_6, 1 November 2016, Pages vi179). These patients were reported to have achieved a 92% rate of local control of their cancers during the follow-up interval.
 
The Company collaborated with GT Med Tech to file an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to clear GammaTile™ for clinical use and the FDA provided clearance on July 6, 2018. In 2016, the Company, in support of GammaTile™, provided assistance throughout the application process to obtain an ICD-10-PCS code. ICD-10-PCS is a code set designed for use in the hospital inpatient setting in the United States. ICD-10-PCS codes can be used to identify and track differences in resource consumption, quality, and patient outcomes for different inpatient hospital procedures. ICD-10-PCS codes are distinguishable from the MS-DRG (Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group) codes that are commonly used to assign payment levels to inpatient hospital admissions for use by Medicare and other health care insurers. 
 
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) established an ICD-10-PCS code for GammaTile™, 00H004Z (insertion of radioactive element, Cesium-131 implant into brain, open approach). CMS also mapped GammaTile™’s ICD-10-PCS code to DRG 023.  DRG 023 is the highest paying DRG for craniotomy procedures. Along with Medicare, Commercial Carriers and many Medicaid programs use the ICD-10-PCS and DRG code sets, including DRG 23.
 
In addition to the traditional coding and reimbursement mechanisms, there is an additional mechanism under Medicare to help ensure that adequate payment is made for new medical services and technologies in the hospital inpatient setting. This mechanism is called “New Technology Add-on Payment” or “NTAP.” CMS may grant NTAP status to technologies that meet a set of criteria, including requirements involving newness, cost, and whether the product results in a substantial clinical improvement in comparison to existing therapies.  Under NTAP, hospitals can receive additional reimbursement when treating Medicare beneficiaries with the new technology during the initial two or three years that the product is on the market. The rules governing NTAP eligibility and processes are described in greater detail on the CMS website and in notices that are published from time-to-time in a government publication called the Federal Register. 
 
GT Med Tech applied to CMS for NTAP status for GammaTile™.  In August 2019, CMS concluded that the Agency would not approve NTAP status for GammaTile™.  We cannot predict the likelihood of whether CMS may make a favorable decision in the future if GT Med Tech decides to continue pursuing NTAP status.  Based on the NTAP rules and the initial date of clearance for GammaTile™ by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, we anticipate that GammaTile™ would remain eligible to re-apply for NTAP status that would take effect during the 2021 federal fiscal year (October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021). 
 
We are not aware of anything in the CMS notice from August 2019 on NTAP status or otherwise that would suggest any changes are forthcoming for the mapping of the GammaTile™ procedure to DRG 023 for reimbursement purposes.  We cannot predict with certainty whether or how the Medicare program may revise its coding or reimbursement policies in the future.
 
Despite the lack of an NTAP code, GT Med Tech has reimbursement for GammaTile™ under ICD-10PCS-00H004Z and MS-DRG 023 which reimburses hospitals in the inpatient setting and will continue to roll out its sales and marketing strategy for release of GammaTile™. Since January 2019, GammaTile™ Therapy has been in a limited market release and total revenues from sales to GT Med Tech have been nominal. GT Med Tech has indicated it intends to increase sales and marketing efforts during the Company’s fiscal year 2020, but there is no assurance that this will occur.
 
Head and Neck Cancer
 
An emerging possible indication for Cesium-131 brachytherapy is the treatment of recurrent head and neck cancers.  First reported by Bhupesh Parashar MD from Weill Cornell Medical College (A. Pham, et al.  Cesium-131 brachytherapy in high risk and recurrent head and neck cancers: first report of long-term outcomes.  J Contemp Brachytherapy 7(6):445-52 (2015), the appeal of Cesium-131 brachytherapy in the treatment of these cancers lies in the motivation by the practitioner to avoid delivering dose to critical structures in the head and neck, including the arteries and the spinal cord.  Since these patients have already been subjected to external beam radiation therapy and may not tolerate another course, brachytherapy with cesium-131 offers a significant re-treatment option.
 
In fiscal 2019 a group from Thomas Jefferson University published their initial results from a series of 15 patients with recurrent head and neck cancers treated with surgery and Cesium-131 brachytherapy (V. Bar-Ad, et al.  Single institution implementation of permanent (131)Cs interstitial brachytherapy for previously irradiated patients with resectable recurrent head and neck carcinoma.  J Contemp Brachytherapy 11(3):227-34 (2019)).  The authors of this paper concluded that Cesium-131 brachytherapy is a feasible treatment option for these patients.

Industry Information
 
Prostate Cancer Treatment
 
According to the American Cancer Society, one in seven men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime. It is the most common form of cancer in men after skin cancer, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men following lung cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be about 174,650 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed and an estimated 31,620 deaths associated with the disease in the United States in 2019.
 
Prostate cancer treatment remains a key focus of the Company. Most doctors use the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system to stage prostate cancer. This system is based on three key pieces of information:
 

■ | The extent of the main tumor (T category);
--+-------------------------------------------


■ | Whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes (N category); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Whether the cancer has metastasized (spread) to other parts of the body (M category).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These factors are combined to determine an overall stage, using Roman numerals I through IV (1-4). The lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, such as stage IV, means a more advanced cancer.
 
Once diagnosed, prostate cancer can generally be divided into either localized or advanced disease. Further, within the localized category the disease can be further categorized to one of the three “risk groups”: low, intermediate and high risk. As the risk increases so does the probability of advanced cancer at diagnosis and the probability of failing treatment with cancer progression or recurrence.
 
Low Dose Rate Permanent Brachytherapy (LDR). Isoray’s Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds are an option in the treatment of prostate cancers of all risk levels of localized disease. In this approach, seeds of radioactive material are placed inside thin needles, which are inserted through the skin in the area between the scrotum and anus and into the prostate. The seeds are left in place as the needles are removed and give off low doses of radiation for weeks or months. Radiation from the seeds travels a very short distance, so the seeds can give off a large amount of radiation in a very small area. This limits the amount of damage to nearby healthy tissues.
 
Isoray’s Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds are an option in the treatment of prostate cancers of all risk levels of localized disease. The diagnosis of prostate cancer – and especially low risk prostate cancer – has been potentially reduced with the introduction of guidelines dissuading the use of serum PSA screening at the general practitioner level as a means to detect prostate cancer early in men with no symptoms of prostate cancer. Effective July 2012, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against the use of the PSA test as a screening tool. As a result of the recommendation, prostate cancer diagnosis dropped by 12.2% the month after the recommendation and has continued to drop. (D.A. Barocas, et al., Effect of the USPSTF Grade D Recommendation against Screening for Prostate Cancer on Incident Prostate Cancer Diagnoses in the United States, J Urol 194(6) The Journal of Urology (2015)).
 
In 2018, the USPSTF finalized its recommendation from advising against screening to the position that the decision for men between 55 and 69 to undergo PSA-based screening should be made by a man in consultation with his doctor. This change may contribute to an increased incidence of prostate screening (and therefore more prostate cancer cases) as opposed to an unscreened population – although this conclusion will await future trending information. To the knowledge of management, this is the latest information available.
 
Furthermore, the deferral of potentially cancer-eradicating (definitive) prostate cancer treatments such as surgery and radiation therapy has become more popular as some men with prostate cancer have decided to “watch” the cancer using a variety of diagnostic tools – a trend known as “active surveillance.”
 
 6


As such, the industry has experienced an overall decrease in the number of low risk cases of prostate cancer diagnosed due to reduced PSA screening, as well as a larger number of men who are deferring treatment altogether at a higher rate than seen historically. Intense competition in the space due to numerous established treatment options along with added entrants such as robotic surgery and proton therapy has further eroded the overall brachytherapy market share. The industry continues to focus on the significant data that supports the use of brachytherapy in treating prostate cancer. Management believes the current review of cost effective treatment comparisons with other treatment options, the aging population worldwide and the efficacy of treatment has recently contributed to the revitalization of brachytherapy treatment for prostate cancer.
 
Minimally invasive brachytherapy such as that provided by the Company’s Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds provides significant advantages over competing treatments including lower cost, equal or better survival data, fewer side effects, faster recovery time and the convenience of a single outpatient implant procedure that generally lasts less than one hour (Grimm, et al., Comparative analysis of prostate-specific antigen free survival outcomes for patients with low, intermediate and high risk prostate cancer treatment by radical therapy. Results from the Prostate Cancer Results Study Group, British Journal of Urology International, Vol. 109 (Suppl 1), (2012); Merrick, et al., Effect of prostate size and isotope selection on dosimetric quality following permanent seed implantation, Techniques in Urology Vol. 7 (2001); Potters, et al., 12-Year Outcomes Following Permanent Prostate Brachytherapy in Patients with Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer, Journal of Urology (May 2005); Sharkey, et al., Brachytherapy versus radical prostatectomy in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer, Current Urology Reports, (2002)).
 
In addition to permanent, LDR brachytherapy, such as Cesium-131, localized prostate cancer can be treated with prostatectomy surgery (RP for radical prostatectomy), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), dual or combination therapy, permanent, high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR), cryosurgery, hormone therapy, proton therapy and active surveillance (watchful waiting). The success of any treatment is measured by the feasibility of the procedure for the patient, morbidities associated with the treatment, overall survival, and cost. When the cancerous tissue is not completely eliminated, the cancer typically returns to the primary site, often with metastases to other areas of the body.
 
Prostatectomy Surgery Options. In the radical prostatectomy operation, a surgeon will remove the entire prostate gland plus some of the tissue around it, including the seminal vesicles. New methods such as laparoscopic and robotic prostatectomy surgeries are currently being used more frequently in order to minimize the damage that leads to impotence and incontinence, but these techniques require a high degree of surgical skill. (American Cancer Society, 2016) Surgical resection accounted for approximately 44% of treatments before the introduction of robotic prostatectomy in the early 2000s and then rose to 60% in 2010. (J.M. Martin, et al. The rise and fall of prostate brachytherapy: Use of brachytherapy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in the National Cancer Data Base, Cancer 120:2114–2121 (2014); J.M. Martin, et al., Use of brachytherapy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in the National Cancer Data Base, Cancer 120:2114–2121 (2014), Duke University, International Focal Therapy Conference, (June 2016)). To the knowledge of management, this is the latest most relevant information available.
 
External Radiation Therapy. Primary External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT), Three-dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT), Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SBRT), Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Proton Therapy all involve directing a beam of radiation from outside the body at the prostate gland to destroy cancerous tissue. Treatments are received on an outpatient basis with the patient usually receiving five treatments per week over a period of several weeks (up to nine). While the treatments each last only a few minutes, getting the patient and equipment in place for each treatment takes longer. The use of EBRT as a whole doubled from 11.6% in 2004 to 24% in 2009. The increase in the number of cases being treated with EBRT during 2004 to 2008 were cases that historically would have been treated with brachytherapy. During that period there was a nearly complete transition to IMRT as the predominant method with IMRT treatment increasing from 0.15% to 95.9% of EBRT treatments from 2000 to 2008. (U. Mahmood, et al., Declining use of brachytherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer, Brachytherapy 13:157–162 (2014). Side effects of these treatments can include bowel problems, bladder problems, urinary incontinence, impotence, fatigue, lymphedema, and urethral stricture. To the knowledge of management, this is the latest most relevant information available.

Proton beam radiation therapy. Proton beam therapy focuses beams of protons instead of x-rays on the cancer. Unlike x-rays, which release energy both before and after they hit their target, protons cause little damage to tissues they pass through and release their energy only after traveling a certain distance. This means that proton beam radiation can, in theory, deliver more radiation to the prostate while doing less damage to nearby normal tissues. Proton beam radiation can be aimed with techniques similar to 3D-CRT and IMRT.
 
Although in theory proton beam therapy might be more effective than using x-rays, so far studies have not shown if this is true. As of the filing of this Form 10-K, proton beam therapy is not widely available. The machines needed to make protons are very expensive, and they are not available in many centers in the United States. Management believes proton beam radiation is not covered by all insurance companies as of the filing of this Form 10-K.
 
Dual or Combination Therapy. Dual therapy is the combination of IMRT or 3-dimensional conformal external beam radiation and seed brachytherapy to treat extra-prostatic disease or high-risk prostate cancers. Combination therapy treats high risk patients with a course of IMRT or EBRT over a period of several weeks. When this initial treatment is completed, the patient must then wait for several more weeks to months to have the prostate seed implant. The process could also involve the seed implant be performed first, followed by the course of external radiation. Management estimates that at least 25% of all U.S. prostate implants are now dual therapy cases. 
High Dose Rate Temporary Brachytherapy (HDR). HDR temporary brachytherapy involves placing soft nylon tubes (catheters) into the prostate gland and then giving a series of radiation treatments through these catheters. The catheters are then removed and no radioactive material is left in the prostate gland. A radioactive source typically containing Iridium-192 is placed into the catheters. This procedure is typically repeated multiple times over a period of several days while the patient is hospitalized.
Watchful Waiting and Active Surveillance. Because prostate cancer often grows very slowly, some men (especially those who are older or who have other major health problems) may never need treatment for their cancer. Instead, their doctor may suggest watchful waiting or active surveillance, terms physicians may use differently or interchangeably.

■ | Active surveillance is often used to mean watching the cancer closely with PSA blood tests, digital rectal exams (DREs), and ultrasounds at regular intervals to see if the cancer is growing. Prostate biopsies may be done as well to see if the cancer is starting to grow faster. If there is a change in a patient’s test results, the doctor would then talk to the patient about treatment options.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Watchful waiting (observation) is sometimes used to describe a less intense type of follow-up that may mean fewer tests and relying more on changes in a man’s symptoms to decide if treatment is needed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
So far, no large randomized studies have compared active surveillance to treatments such as surgery or radiation therapy.
 
Additional Treatments. Additional, but less frequently used, treatments include cryotherapy, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy.

Clinical Series for Prostate Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy
 
Other studies have demonstrated similar, durably high rates of control following brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer out to 15 years post-treatment (J. Sylvester, et al., 15-year biochemical relapse free survival in clinical stage T1-T3 prostate cancer following combined external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy; Seattle experience International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, Vol. 67, Issue 1, 57-64 (2007)). The cumulative effect of these studies has been the conclusion by leaders in the field that brachytherapy offers a disease control rate as high as surgery, though with a lesser side-effect profile than surgery (J.P. Ciezki , Prostate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer, Current Treatment Options in Oncology Volume 6, 389-393 (2005)).
 
Long-term survival data for brachytherapy with I-125 and Pd-103 supports the efficacy of brachytherapy in the treatment of clinically localized cancer of the prostate gland. Clinical data indicate that brachytherapy offers success rates for early-stage prostate cancer treatment that are equal to or better than those of RP or EBRT. While historically clinical studies of brachytherapy have focused primarily on results from brachytherapy with I-125 and Pd-103, management believes that these data are also relevant for brachytherapy with Cesium-131. In fact, it appears that Cesium-131 offers comparable and potentially improved clinical symptom outcomes over I-125 and Pd-103, perhaps due to its shorter half-life. (A.B. Shah, et al., A comparison of AUA symptom scores following permanent low dose rate prostate brachytherapy with iodine-125 and cesium-131, Brachytherapy 12 (Suppl. 1) S64 (2013)). In addition, a report from 2017 describes favorable long-term quality of life outcomes following Cesium-131 brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer (S.M. Glaser, et al., Long-Term Quality of Life in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Cesium-131, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 98(5):1053-1058 (2017)).
 
In May 2017 a collaborative group of Canadian researchers published the results of a study that randomized intermediate- to high-risk localized prostate cancer to an external beam dose escalation and a permanent implant brachytherapy dose escalation (W. J. Morris, et al. Androgen Suppression Combined with Elective Nodal and Dose Escalated Radiation Therapy (the ASCENDE-RT Trial): An Analysis of Survival Endpoints for a Randomized Trial Comparing a Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy Boost to a Dose-Escalated External Beam Boost for High- and Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer, International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics Volume 98, 275-285, 2017). These patients all underwent standard external beam radiation therapy and hormonal therapy. This study, known as the “ASCENDE-RT” study, demonstrated a significant therapeutic advantage to the patients who underwent permanent implant brachytherapy boost, reporting a 20% advantage (83% versus 63%) in biochemical relapse-free survival at nine years following treatment.
 
This study is the first in many years to successfully randomize a group of newly diagnosed, localized prostate cancer patients and demonstrate a statistically significant advantage to one treatment over another – in this case iodine-125 brachytherapy boost over external beam radiation therapy boost. The impact on the number of patients considered for “combination therapy” (external beam and brachytherapy) could be substantial, especially once men are informed of these study results.
 
Sexual impotence and urinary incontinence are two major concerns men face when choosing among various forms of treatment for prostate cancer. Studies have shown that brachytherapy with existing sources results in lower rates of impotence and incontinence than surgery (C. Buron, et al., Brachytherapy versus prostatectomy in localized prostate cancer: results of a French multicenter prospective medico-economic study, International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics Volume 67, 812-822 (2007)). Combined with the high disease control rates described in many studies, these findings have driven the adoption of brachytherapy as a front-line therapy for localized prostate cancer.
 
Comparing Cesium-131 to I-125 and Pd-103 Clinical Results
 
Management believes that the Cesium-131 brachytherapy seed has specific clinical advantages for treating cancer over I-125 and Pd-103, the other isotopes currently used in brachytherapy seeds. The table below highlights the key differences of the three isotopes. 
 

 | | Isotope Delivery Over Time
-----------+-----------+---------------------------
Isotope | Half-Life | Energy | 90% Dose
Cesium-131 | 9.7 days | 30.4 keV | 33 days 
Pd-103 | 17 days | 20.8 keV | 58 days 
I-125 | 60 days | 28.5 keV | 204 days

In June 2019, a study was published on long-term follow-up data collected on Cesium-131 as compared to I-125 (Agarwal M., Braccioforte M.H., Amin N., et al. Long Term Results from a Prospective Randomized Trial of 131Cs vs 125I Permanent Prostate Brachytherapy, Brachytherapy: An International Multidisciplinary Journal, May-June 2019). This long-term data with nine-year median follow-up shows comparable long-term biochemical control (prostate-specific antigen recurrence) results between Cesium-131 and Iodine-125 in these patients. The data supports Cesium-131 as an effective long-term solution for these patients and supports Cesium-131 as a viable choice for prostate cancer patients.
 
Improved side-effect profile.

In addition to the cancer-related outcomes described for prostate brachytherapy, a significant portion of patients who undergo I-125 or Pd-103 brachytherapy experience acute urinary irritative symptoms following treatment – more so than with surgery or external beam radiation therapy (S.J. Frank, et al., An assessment of quality of life following radical prostatectomy, high dose external beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy Iodine implantation as monotherapies for localized prostate cancer, Journal of Urology Volume 177, 2151-2156 (2007)). These irritative symptoms can range from an increased frequency of urination to significant pain upon urination. Because the portion of the urethra that runs through the prostate takes high doses from the implant, these side effects are fairly common following prostate brachytherapy.
 
Studies show that Cesium-131, with the shortest available half-life of the commonly used implantable isotopes, results in a quicker resolution of these irritative symptoms based on the shorter time interval over which normal tissue receives radiation from the implanted sources than for longer lived isotopes such as I-125. (A. Shah, et al., A comparison of AUA symptom scores following permanent low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy with Iodine-125 and Cesium-131, Brachytherapy 12(SI) S64 (2013)). These results are seemingly confirmed with long-term quality of life data as described by a study from UPMC, where it was suggested that patients treated with Cesium-131 prostate brachytherapy were able to recover and maintain their baseline quality of life in the long term. Glaser, S. M., et al. (2017). Long-Term Quality of Life in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Cesium-131. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 98(5): 1053-1058.

The advantage of the Company’s Cesium-131 brachytherapy seed is the resolution of urinary side effects as pictured in the graphic below has been observed in a second study, presented at the 2013 Annual Meeting of the American Brachytherapy Society (A.B. Shah, et al). The following graph is a comparison of elevated side effect (AUA) symptom scores following permanent low dose rate prostate brachytherapy with Iodine-125 and Cesium-131. (Brachytherapy 12(Suppl. 1) S64 (2013)):
 

As seen in the plot of these AUA scores, the duration of an elevated side effect score profile resolved to pre-treatment levels more quickly with the Cesium-131 group than with the Iodine-125 group. All patients were treated at the same institution by the same physicians, and the difference in the time to resolution was considered significant.
 
Further evidence of the favorable side effect profile of Cesium-131 was published by a group from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) in August 2017 (Glaser 2017). This report concluded that only minimal long-term changes were noted to the urinary and bowel quality of life measures, and that men treated with Cesium-131 for their prostate cancers are able to return to baseline measure of quality of life after treatment.
 
Brain Cancer Treatment Options
 
An estimated 23,820 new cases of malignant primary tumors of the brain or spinal cord are expected to be diagnosed in 2019. About 17,760 people are expected to die from brain and spinal cord tumors in 2019. (American Cancer Society, 2019). In addition to primary tumors, metastasis of brain tumors from other body sites are estimated at over 65,000 new cases per year. The chance that a person will develop a malignant tumor of the brain or spinal cord is about 1 in 143 for a man and 1 in 185 for a woman. These numbers would be much higher if benign tumors were also included. (American Cancer Society, 2019).
 
On July 6, 2018, the Company and GT Med Tech received FDA 510(k) regulatory clearance for the brachytherapy technology, known as GammaTile™ Therapy that incorporates proprietary Cesium-131 seeds within customizable collagen-based carriers for the treatment of recurrent brain tumors. Isoray Medical and GT Medical Technology had previously executed a collaborative development agreement and an exclusive ten-year supply agreement for GammaTile™ Therapy. In fiscal year 2019, the Company and GT Med Tech amended and restated the manufacturing and supply agreement which now expires in April 2029. The amended agreement requires GT Med Tech to provide on a monthly basis a twelve-month rolling forecast.  The first calendar month of each rolling forecast becomes a binding purchase order and the remaining eleven months are a non-binding forecast.  The amended agreement also adjusted some pricing due to updated procedures, allows GT Med Tech to move the loading of the GammaTile™ to another non-Company facility provided GT Med Tech continues to purchase Cesium-131 seeds exclusively from the Company, and also governs how GammaTile™ process improvement projects will be scoped and billed. GammaTile™ leverages Cesium-131’s unique ability to deliver a highly targeted dose of intense radiation treatment while limiting radiation exposure to surrounding tissue. In 2016, the Company, in support of GammaTile™, provided assistance throughout the application process to obtain an ICD-10-PCS code.  ICD-10-PCS is a code set designed for use in the hospital inpatient setting in the United States.  ICD-10-PCS codes can be used to identify and track differences in resource consumption, quality, and patient outcomes for different inpatient hospital procedures.  ICD-10-PCS codes are distinguishable from the MS-DRG (Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group) codes that are commonly used to assign payment levels to inpatient hospital admissions for use by Medicare and other health care insurers. 
 
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) established an ICD-10-PCS code for GammaTile™, 00H004Z (insertion of radioactive element, Cesium-131 implant into brain, open approach).  CMS also mapped GammaTile™’s ICD-10-PCS code to DRG 023.  DRG 023 is the highest paying DRG for craniotomy procedures.  Along with Medicare, Commercial Carriers and many Medicaid programs use the ICD-10-PCS and DRG code sets, including DRG 23.
 
In addition to the traditional coding and reimbursement mechanisms, there is an additional mechanism under Medicare to help ensure that adequate payment is made for new medical services and technologies in the hospital inpatient setting. This mechanism is called “New Technology Add-on Payment” or “NTAP.” CMS may grant NTAP status to technologies that meet a set of criteria, including requirements involving newness, cost, and whether the product results in a substantial clinical improvement in comparison to existing therapies. Under NTAP, hospitals can receive additional reimbursement when treating Medicare beneficiaries with the new technology during the initial two or three years that the product is on the market. The rules governing NTAP eligibility and processes are described in greater detail on the CMS website and in notices that are published from time-to-time in a government publication called the Federal Register. 
 
GT Med Tech applied to CMS for NTAP status for GammaTile™. In August 2019, CMS concluded that the Agency would not approve NTAP status for GammaTile™.  We cannot predict the likelihood of whether CMS may make a favorable decision in the future if GT Med Tech decides to continue pursuing NTAP status.  Based on the NTAP rules and the initial date of clearance for GammaTile™ by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, we anticipate that GammaTile™ would remain eligible to re-apply for NTAP status that would take effect during the 2021 federal fiscal year (October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021). 
 
We are not aware of anything in the CMS notice from August 2019 on NTAP status or otherwise that would suggest any changes are forthcoming for the mapping of the GammaTile™ procedure to DRG 023 for reimbursement purposes.  We cannot predict with certainty whether or how the Medicare program may revise its coding or reimbursement policies in the future.
 
Despite the lack of an NTAP code, GT Med Tech has reimbursement for GammaTile™ under ICD-10PCS-00H004Z and MS-DRG 023 which reimburses hospitals in the inpatient setting and will continue to roll out its sales and marketing strategy for release of GammaTile™. Since January 2019, GammaTile™ Therapy has been in a limited market release and total revenues from sales to GT Med Tech have been nominal. GT Med Tech has indicated it intends to increase sales and marketing efforts during the Company’s fiscal year 2020, but there is no assurance that this will occur.
 
In addition to GammaTile™ Therapy, the Company’s customers can also use braided strands containing Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds for the treatment of brain cancer. Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds deliver 90% of their dose in 33 days and are therefore well-suited to use with bioabsorbable mesh, single seed applications, implantable strands, and by implantable device.

Gynecological Cancer Treatment Options (Cervical, Vaginal and Vulvar Cancer)
 
An estimated 24,590 new cases of cervical (13,170), vaginal (5,350) and vulvar (6,070) cancers are expected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2019. A combined estimate of 6,960 deaths are expected to occur from cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers in the United States in 2019 (American Cancer Society, 2019). In addition to brachytherapy to treat gynecological cancers such as cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers, other treatment options include surgery, laser surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and topical treatments.
 
During 2016, two abstracts (J. Feddock, et al., Permanent interstitial re-irradiation with cesium-131: a highly successful second chance for cure in recurrent pelvic malignancies, Brachytherapy 15(S1):S78-9 (2016); J. Feddock, et al., Outpatient interstitial implants - integrating cesium-131 permanent interstitial brachytherapy into definitive treatment for gynecologic malignancies, Brachytherapy 15(S1):S93-4 (2016)) and presentations were presented at the World Brachytherapy Conference in San Francisco on the treatment of Re-Irradiation with Cesium-131 in recurrent pelvic malignances in women who have recurrent cancers. Physicians at the University of Kentucky, College of Medicine reported local control in 80.7% after Cesium-131 implantation for the recurrent patients and reported successful control of 22 women with pelvic cancer that had not had previous treatment. Based upon the positive results seen in the Cesium-131 treatment of recurrent gynecological cancers, physicians at the University of Kentucky are currently moving Cesium-131 treatment into the primary treatment of these cancers.
 
In April 2017, the group from the University of Kentucky published a paper in the journal Brachytherapy that described the early experience with a template-based approach using Cesium-131 in the treatment of gynecologic cancers. Although reporting on only five patients, the University of Kentucky physicians demonstrated the feasibility and safety of replacing a high dose-rate isotope (Iridium-192) with Cesium-131. This report builds on the earlier published and presented work that strongly suggests a role for Cesium-131 in the treatment of gynecologic cancers.
 
Head and Neck Cancer Treatment Options
 
An estimated 53,000 new cases of head and neck cancer are expected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2019. (American Cancer Society, 2019).
 
Surgery is the most common option to treat head and neck cancers. Chemotherapy is often used in conjunction with surgery or radiation therapy depending on the type and stage of the cancer. External beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy have been used together or in combination with surgery or chemotherapy. Immunotherapy is a newer treatment option for advanced or recurrent cancer (American Cancer Society, 2019).
 
Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds allow oncologists to add targeted radiation treatment to head and neck cancers after surgical resection. This targeted radiation treatment is especially needed in patients whose neck cancer has recurred following previous radiation therapy. Often these patients cannot tolerate further external beam radiation therapy for fear of over radiating critical head and neck structures.
 
Management believes Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds continue to represent an improved approach to brachytherapy treatment of specific head and neck cancers.
 
Lung Cancer Treatment Options
 
An estimated 228,150 new cases of lung cancer are expected in 2019, accounting for 13% of all cancer diagnoses in the United States. Approximately 24% of all cancer deaths are from lung cancer and it accounts for the most cancer related deaths in both men and women in the United States. An estimated 142,670 deaths will result from lung cancer in 2019. (American Cancer Society, 2019).
 
Lung cancer has historically been treated utilizing surgery, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy including LDR brachytherapy. More than one kind of treatment may be used, depending on the stage of the patient’s cancer and other factors. (American Cancer Society, 2018).
 
The Company believes that Cesium-131, with its shorter half-life (faster rate of decay) and relatively high energy, is better suited for treating lung cancer in Stages I and II than I-125. The bioabsorbable mesh used in this procedure to apply the Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds generally dissolves after about 45 days. Cesium-131 delivers 90% of its dose in 33 days and is therefore well-suited to use with bioabsorbable mesh. A report was published in May of 2015 describing outcomes from a series of 52 patients treated with a limited surgical resection and Cesium-131 brachytherapy. (B. Parashar, et al., Analysis of stereotactic radiation vs. wedge resection vs. wedge resection plus Cesium-131 brachytherapy in early stage lung cancer, Brachytherapy 14 (5):648-54 (2015)).

Our Strategy
 
The key elements of Isoray’s strategy for fiscal year 2020 includes:
 
Continue to Invest in Sales and Marketing Development Activities. Prostate cancer treatment represents the original and core business for the Company’s Cesium-131 product. With long-term follow-up data relating to biochemical (PSA) control of prostate cancer now presented to the prostate cancer field, Isoray plans to aggressively increase the number of centers using Cesium-131 through its direct sales force and through its international distributors. Because intermediate- to long-term follow-up data is required to convince clinicians and patients to consider any particular therapy for localized prostate cancer, the availability of long-term data with Cesium-131 in the treatment of prostate cancer represents a significant milestone. Isoray hopes to capture much of the incremental market growth if and when seed implant brachytherapy recovers market share from other treatments, take market share from existing competitors, and expand the use of Cesium-131 as a dual therapy option where it has experienced success. In 2016, the Company started its aggressive sales and marketing approach by hiring industry sales and marketing veterans to assist in this market development effort, including the hire in March 2016 of a Vice-President of Sales and Marketing and Marketing support personnel, who have developed and continue to develop a comprehensive strategy to expand the presence of the Company’s Cesium-131 products in the prostate market. In addition, the Company filled its regional sales positions with experienced sales staff from the prostate brachytherapy industry. A redesigned website for Isoray.com was launched in September 2016 that focused its message to specific decision makers including the physician, patient, family and friends. The new website supports management’s focus on the growth of sales from the treatment of prostate cancer and the Company’s efforts to expand into brain, head and neck, gynecological, and other cancers. The Company has invested in direct to consumer marketing campaigns through social media to target potential patients and their family and friends. These efforts have resulted in significant year over year growth in web traffic (50.1% increase in total visitors), new visitors (48.52% increase) and organic search results (71.5% increase in resulting site traffic). The Company believes that an increased digital presence will result in increased awareness about brachytherapy overall, and specifically increased awareness about Cesium-131. Management believes that this increased awareness will ultimately translate to more patients finding a physician with Cesium-131 experience.
Blu Build™ Loader. The Company believes that customers perform prostate brachytherapy procedures via one of several general procedure techniques, including (but not limited to): Pre-plan techniques, Intra-operative techniques, and Real-time techniques. Further, the Company believes that customers are comfortable with their techniques, and want products to facilitate their preferred methods. All of the Company’s competitors provide a set of standard products (including loose seeds, seeds loaded in cartridges, and seeds pre-loaded in needles) to meet the customer needs. Further Theragenics and BD have products that support intra-operative and real-time techniques that allow for stranding or linking seeds together in custom configurations in the operating room. These products allow physicians to gain the benefits of stranded or linked seeds while still allowing for customization to the patient anatomy, as determined at the time of the procedure. The Company believes that approximately 25% of procedures are performed with some level of customization in the operating room.
 
It is this segment of the market – customers looking to customize their procedures to the anatomy at the time of the procedure – that the Company expects to address with its new Blu Build™ loading device. The Blu Build™ loading device efficiently configures strands in the operating room, allowing the clinician to make determinations about the product configurations with the most recent picture of the patient’s anatomy. The Company believes that this technique may provide advantages in some brachytherapy products and will provide a better solution for this market segment. The Company also believe the efficiency and ease of use of the Blu Build™ loading device will offer an intriguing opportunity for the other 75% of the market.
 
During fiscal year 2019, the Company released the Blu Build™ loader in a limited market release. Based on feedback from the limited market release, the Company adjusted certain intricacies of the design. This is the first internally developed proprietary delivery device in the Company's history. The Company expects to have a full market release of the Blu Build™ loader during its second quarter of fiscal year 2020, but there is no assurance that this will occur.
 
Commercialization of GammaTile™ Therapy for the treatment of recurrent brain metastases. The utilization of the GammaTile™ system over the past five years has developed a product with consistent and repeatable results as evidenced by the June 2016 presentation at the Society of Neurologic Oncologists. Management intends to continue to support and facilitate the commercialization of the GammaTile™ Therapy by GT Medical Technologies product.
 
In January 2018 the Company entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with GT Med Tech and in April 2019 the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with GT Med Tech (collectively the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement). Pursuant to the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, the Company has agreed to exclusively supply Cesium-131 seeds to be incorporated into the GammaTile™ Therapy and manufacture the GammaTile™ Therapy product for end users designated by GT Med Tech.
 
In January 2019, GT Med Tech, which is the sole commercial agent of GammaTile™ Therapy, began a limited market release with plans for a full market release in 2020. The Company continues to provide assistance to GT Med Tech for various process improvement projects on a time and materials basis. To date revenues realized from the process improvement projects have been nominal.
 
GammaTile™ Therapy has been assigned a new specific ICD-10_PCS code by the CMS for reimbursement purposes in the hospital setting. 
 
Increase utilization of Cesium-131 in treatment of other solid tumor applications such as brain, gynecological, and other cancers. The Company has clearance from the FDA for its premarket notification (510(k)) for Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds that are preloaded into bioabsorbable braided sutures and bioabsorbable braided sutures attached to bio absorbable mesh. This FDA clearance allows commercial distribution for treatment of brain, gynecological, head and neck and lung tumors as well as tumors in other organs. The Company continues to sell product to physicians treating brain, gynecological, head and neck and lung cancer while continuing to support the compilation of treatment outcomes for publication. Isoray will continue to explore licenses or joint ventures with other companies to develop the appropriate technologies and therapeutic delivery systems for treatment of other solid tumors.
 
Early clinical data support management’s initiatives into brain cancers, gynecological, head and neck, and early stage non-small cell lung cancers. Local control – defined as success in preventing the re-growth of cancer in the immediate vicinity of the treatment area – has been excellent to date.
 
Support Clinical Research and sustained product development. The publication and presentation of speculative and real-world data contribute to the acceptability of Cesium-131 in the oncologic marketplace. Discussion in the medical-scientific community of established and novel Cesium-131 applications is considered a prerequisite to expansion into untapped markets. The Company structures and supports clinical studies on the therapeutic benefits of Cesium-131 for the treatment of solid tumors and other patient benefits. We are and will continue to support clinical studies with several leading radiation oncologists to clinically document patient outcomes, provide support for our product claims, and compare the performance of our seeds to competing seeds. Isoray plans to sustain long-term growth by implementing research and development programs with leading medical institutions in the U.S. and other countries to identify and develop other applications for Isoray’s core radioisotope technology. The Company has deployed a secure, regulatory environment compliant, online information system capable of large usable databases to participating investigators.

During fiscal year 2019, four presentations were accepted at the annual meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) in October 2018 covering topics related to Cesium-131 treatment of gynecologic cancers, prostate and brain cancers. Four presentations were also made at the 2019 annual meeting of the American Brachytherapy Society in June 2019. The Company will continue to seek to increase the number of reports made to society meetings and the peer reviewed literature in order to seek to enhance the standing of its products in the scientific community.
 
The Company also continues to consult with noted contributors from the medical physics community and expects that articles for professional journals regarding the benefits of and clinical trials involving Cesium-131 will continue to be submitted.
 
In addition, the Company continues to support the clinical findings of the various protocols and publications through presentations by respected thought leaders. The Company will continually review and update all marketing materials as more clinical information is gathered from the protocols and studies. Apart from clinical studies and papers sponsored by the Company, several physicians across the country have independently published papers and studies on the benefits of Cesium-131.
 
Targeted Expansion into International Markets. The Company believes that in addition to a significant domestic market for their products, there exists a potential international demand for Cesium-131. The current global market for permanent prostate brachytherapy is larger than the domestic market. Further, many of the surgical applications the Company is exploring domestically may also have significant international opportunities.
 
Historically, the Company has placed limited resources towards realizing these international opportunities, instead keeping the focus of expanding our domestic market share. The Company has provided Cesium-131 product, when requested, to certain markets with potential distributors, however, this distribution has been limited. Instead of relying solely on perceived demand by a potential distributor which believes in the viability of the Company’s product in a given country, the Company will continue to consider international markets and only enter those markets based on a potential market meeting some or all of the following criteria:
 

● | Investigating different geographical markets – In order to maximize return of international investments, the Company will need to understand the regulatory and reimbursement environment, as well as patient and market sizes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assessing potential physician / patient interest in Cesium-131 – In addition to reviewing the market receptiveness, the Company will work with its existing network of opinion leaders and partners to determine the clinical interest in Cesium-131, and where it may be most appropriate to assess the fit / adoption of Cesium-131.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assessing geographical clinical and capital expense factors – It will be key to understand the alternative therapies available in a given foreign market. For example, in some regions large capital investments are difficult, making the use of permanent brachytherapy more attractive.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Identifying potential partners / strategies – The Company will assess if there are strategic partners or other potential strategies for addressing a particular foreign market.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On July 14, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with a distributor in Russia that provides for the ability to sell the entire product line in the Russian Federation. The agreement has a one-year initial term with two additional one-year terms which automatically renew unless either party invoke their right to terminate earlier under the provisions of the agreement. Although sales have been minimal under this agreement, the two parties elected to have the agreement automatically renew now through July 2020.
 
On August 1, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with a distributor in Italy for the territory of Italy and Switzerland, as its prior Italian distribution agreement, with an affiliate of the new distributor, had expired without any sales. The agreement had a one-year initial term with two additional one-year terms which automatically renew unless either party invokes its right to terminate earlier under the provisions of the agreement. The agreement expired August 1, 2019 and was not renewed.
 
The Company believes that learning more about the different international opportunities will provide a better foundation for its international strategy and potential investments in specific markets.
 
Cesium-131 Manufacturing Process and Suppliers
 
Product Overview
 
Isoray markets the CS-1 Cesium-131 brachytherapy seed for the treatment of prostate cancer, brain cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancers, gynecological cancer, pelvic/abdominal cancer, and colorectal cancer. The Company intends to market Cesium-131 for the treatment of other malignant diseases as opportunities are identified in the future through the use of existing proven technologies that have received FDA-clearance. The strategy of utilizing existing FDA-cleared technologies reduces the time and cost required to develop new applications of Cesium-131 and deliver them to market.
 
Cesium-131 is a radioactive isotope that can be produced by the neutron bombardment of Barium-130 (Ba-130). To produce the Cesium-131 brachytherapy seed, a proprietary chemical separation is performed that results in 99.9% pure Cesium-131 isotope. Purified Cesium-131 is adsorbed onto a ceramic core containing a gold X-ray marker. This internal core assembly is subsequently inserted into a titanium capsule that is then welded shut and becomes a sealed radioactive source and a biocompatible medical device.
 
Product Offerings 
 
In addition to providing loose seeds to customers, most brachytherapy manufacturers offer their seed product to the end user packaged in various configurations provided in a sterile or non-sterile package depending on the customer’s preference. These include:

■ | Pre-loaded needles (loaded typically with three to five seeds and spacers);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In fiscal year 2019, the Company delivered approximately 48% of its Cesium-131 seeds to customers configured in Mick® cartridges, approximately 37% of its Cesium-131 seeds configured in stranded and pre-loaded in a needle form, 8% of its Cesium-131 seeds configured in a braided strand form, 3% of its Cesium-131 seeds sold in a loose configuration and the remaining 4% configured in either a pre-loaded in a needle, Blu Build™, or stranded form.
 
In fiscal year 2012, Isoray obtained a CE mark which allows shipment of seeds loaded into flexible braided strands and flexible strands attached to bioabsorbable mesh into the European Union. During fiscal year 2019, the Company elected to not renew its CE Mark due to no sales activity in the European Union, limited interest in Cesium-131 due to the pricing and reimbursement environment, and changing European Union registration requirements that would have required significant investment into additional clinical trials.
 
Maintain ISO 13485:2016

In August 2008, the Company obtained its initial ISO 13485:2003 certification. This permitted the Company to register its products in Europe in 2008 and in Canada and Russia during fiscal year 2009. The ISO 13485:2003 certification demonstrates that the Company is in compliance with this internationally recognized quality standard and the initial certification was valid for a three-year period. In June 2012, the Company received a recertification to ISO 13485:2003 for an additional three-year period, which was affirmed through a surveillance audit in June 2013. The Company has subsequently maintained timely compliance with ISO 13485:2003. 
 
In March 2017, BSI conducted its full system inspection and recertification and found no nonconformities to ISO 13485:2003 medical device standards. In April 2018, BSI certified the Company’s successful transition to ISO 13485:2016. This transition moved Isoray’s quality system into the current state of the art Quality Management System per the ISO standard. The Company is subject to a recertification audit by BSI every three years, two annual maintenance audits and one additional unannounced audit during each three-year period for a total of four audits during each three-year period. The Company had its first annual surveillance audit in March 2019. The Company successfully passed the audit with only one minor nonconformance found by BSI, which was subsequently resolved. The Company was recommended for continued certification.
 
Isotope Suppliers
 
The Company has identified key reactor facilities in Russia, the U.S., Canada, Poland, Belgium, and South Africa, but is currently solely relying on and has a contract with the Russian suppliers. On December 15, 2016, Medical entered into a new supply contract (the INM Agreement) with The Open Joint Stock Company, Isotope, a Russian company (JSC Isotope). On July 30, 2019, Medical entered into a new supply agreement with JSC Isotope. With this Agreement, Medical can purchase Cesium-131 from the Joint Stock Company, within the quality standards and within the time periods specified, through December 31, 2020.
 
Due to the planned outage at the INM reactor from November 2017 to July 2018, the Company negotiated an agreement in order to receive supply from the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (RIAR) during the outage. INM began returned from its planned outage in August 2018. INM will again be the 100% supplier of Russian-sourced Cesium-131 beginning in August 2019 when RIAR begins a planned outage until approximately summer 2020 and management believes that INM will reach a supply on a 50/50 basis with RIAR beginning approximately in the summer 2020.
 
In order to maximize the efficiency of Cesium-131 production from the RIAR reactor, the Company has consigned its supply of “enriched” Barium to the RIAR facility. “Enriched” in this context refers to a Barium Carbonate supply that contains a greater proportion of the non-radioactive isotope Barium-130 than is found in nature. This higher proportion of Barium-130 leads to a greatly increased yield of Cesium-131 when it is placed in a high flux neutron environment such as that available at RIAR and a small number of other reactors worldwide.
 
The Company also received irradiated barium from the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR), located in the United States. For the fiscal year 2018, approximately eighty percent (80%) of our Cesium-131 was supplied by our Russian supplier and approximately twenty percent (20%) of Cesium-131 was generated by the irradiated barium from MURR. Beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2019, the Company reduced the amount of Cesium-131 provided by the MURR reactor by approximately 35%. After a thorough review of the capacity and quality of production at the MURR facility, the Company decided not to locate a hot cell there to ramp up domestic production. The Company also determined to terminate its supply agreement with MURR thereby eliminating all domestic suppliers of this critical component of its product and the last shipment of isotope from MURR was received in January 2019. This decision means that the Company has no domestic supply capabilities for Cesium-131, however, with sufficient notice it may issue a purchase order as needed from time to time. Even if Cesium-131 was supplied by MURR, MURR cannot manufacture enough supply to meet the Company’s increasing needs and requires additional cost in processing to meet the Company’s isotope specifications.

Management believes that failure to obtain deliveries of Cesium-131 from its Russian supplier, <<JSC Isotope>> (which provides supply from both the INM and RIAR reactors), would have a material adverse effect on seed production. Over a two-year period of time, the Company has reviewed its isotope strategy and negotiated with both the U.S. and Russian reactors. Management has determined that the U.S. based supply alone would never prove capable of meeting current company requirements and at current quality control and cost measures is no longer a viable supply source. Additionally, expanding on-site chemical processing at the U.S. reactor will not meet company demand and is not cost effective.
 
As the Company has now determined to rely solely on its Russian suppliers, it is critical to rely on a strategy for outages. Management has developed a three-step process to insulate the Company isotope supply from unplanned outages at the Russian supplier. Step One: the Company has transferred its stock of enriched barium to the Russian RIAR reactor as a contingency in the case of an outage at one or both of its current isotope providers or at a new isotope supplier in Russia. Step Two: identifying close-proximity Russian reactors that could irradiate targets to transfer to INM or RIAR for further processing. This provides the Company additional capacity to meet demand. Step Three: the Company is performing due diligence to identify other reactors that can supply isotope.
 
Quality Controls
 
In July 2008, Isoray had its baseline inspection by the FDA at its manufacturing and administrative offices in Richland, WA. This inspection was carried out over a five day period during which the investigator performed a complete inspection following Quality Systems Inspection Techniques (QSIT). At the end of the inspection, no report of deviations from Good Manufacturing Practices or list of observations (FDA Form 483) was issued to Isoray. An additional inspection of Isoray was conducted by FDA in April 2013. Again the FDA reported no deviations from Good Manufacturing Practices and did not list any observations (FDA Form 483). In August 2017, the FDA conducted an announced QSIT inspection of the Richland facility and again, did not find any nonconformance to U.S. medical device regulations and did not issue a Form 483.
 
In October 2015, Isoray underwent an unannounced inspection by British Standards Institution (BSI), Isoray’s representative to the European Union and designator of Isoray’s CE Marks with no nonconformities found. BSI also conducted a microbiologic audit and a surveillance audit in November 2015 and March 2016 respectively. In March 2017, BSI conducted its full system inspection and recertification and found no nonconformities to ISO 13485:2003 medical device standards. In April 2018, BSI certified the Company’s successful transition to ISO 13485:2016. This transition moved Isoray’s quality system into the current state of the art Quality Management System per the ISO standard. The Company had its first annual surveillance audit in March 2019. The Company successfully passed the audit with only one minor nonconformance found by BSI, which was subsequently resolved. The Company was recommended for continued certification.
 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also conducted an unannounced audit in May 2016. Because Isoray ships hazardous materials on flights in the U.S., Isoray is subject to regulation by the FAA. No findings were made in this audit.
 
Regulatory Developments
 
In July of 2017, the Company received a five-year renewal from the Washington State Department of Health (WA DOH) in response to its application to renew the Company’s Radioactive Materials License. The WA DOH acts as an agent of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and grants the Company its ability to receive, inventory and ship radioactive material.
 
During fiscal year 2019, the Company elected to not renew its CE Mark due to no sales activity in the European Union, limited interest in Cesium-131 due to the pricing and reimbursement environment, and changing European Union registration requirements that would have required significant investment into additional clinical trials. Therefore, as the Company looks at international opportunities to sell Cesium-131 seeds it will focus on those markets outside of the European Union.
 
Order Processing
 
The Company applies a just-in-time production process that is responsive to customer input and orders to ensure that individual customers receive a higher level of customer service than received from our competitors who have the luxury of longer lead times due to longer half-life products. Time from order confirmation to completion of product manufacture can be as soon as two working days, including processing and purification of Cesium-131, attachment of isotope to a core, loading and welding of the core into a titanium casing, testing, quality assurance, assembling seeds into delivery devices (i.e. needles, sutures, strands, cartridges, etc.), sterilization and shipping.
 
It is up to each physician to determine the dosage necessary for implants and acceptable dosages vary among physicians. Many physicians order more seeds than necessary to assure themselves that they have a sufficient quantity. Upon receipt of an order, the Company either delivers the seeds from its facility directly to the physician in either loose, preloaded, or Blu Build™ form and for a couple customers we send the order to an independent preloading service that delivers the seeds just prior to implant. If the implant is postponed or rescheduled, the short half-life of the seeds makes them unsuitable for use and therefore they must be re-ordered.
 
Due to the lead time for obtaining and processing the Cesium-131 isotope and its short half-life, the Company relies on sales forecasts and historical knowledge to estimate the proper inventory levels of isotope needed to fulfill all customer orders. Consequently, some portion of the isotope is lost through decay and is not used in an end product. Management continues to reduce the variances between ordered isotope and isotope deliveries and is continually improving its ordering process efficiencies.
 
Manufacturing Facility
 
The Company maintains a production facility located at Applied Process Engineering Laboratory (APEL) in Richland, Washington. The APEL facility became operational in September 2007. The production facility has over 15,000 square feet and includes space for isotope separation, seed production, order dispensing, a clean room for assembly of our product offerings, and a dedicated shipping area. In 2015, the Company entered into a modification to the production facility lease that modified the requirement to return the facility to ground at the time of exit at Company discretion, exercised an extension in 2017 to increase the lease term to April 30, 2021, and reduced the required notice to terminate the lease early from twelve months to six months. In July 2019, the Company entered into another modification of the production facility lease that extends the term to April 20, 2026, maintains the current rental rate through April 2020, and provides for an eighteen month termination notice with an early termination penalty of up to $40,000 which decreases each year.
 
These lease modifications provide the flexibility required for the Company to plan, design and construct its own production facility, which is expected to reduce operational cash flow requirements and provide for long-term security of production capabilities for the Company. The Company has completed the design process for a new facility and has permit ready plans to build when the Company needs to move into a new facility. The Company does not anticipate building a new facility until the Company either obtains financing to pay for the facility or can finance the facility through its own operations. Management believes that construction of a new facility will take 18 to 24 months to complete from the time that ground is broken.

Sales and Marketing
 
Marketing Strategy
 
In fiscal 2019, the Company continued to implement and execute on the established sales and marketing strategy. This strategy involves a more direct focus on the prostate cancer market and existing and new Cesium-131 customers, with a secondary focus on developing opportunities in emerging applications, including brain tumors, gynecological cancers and head and neck tumors. This focus was supported by a complete redesign of the Company brand, website and collateral materials. This effort was initiated in fall 2016. This follows the changes to the sales and marketing team that occurred in 2016, when the Company hired a Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Michael Krachon. Mr. Krachon brought more than twenty years of experience of progressive growth in sales and marketing with the past fifteen years in the brachytherapy market.
 
Further to support the new marketing strategy, the Company has started the process of reestablishing its medical advisory boards to provide professional input and insight regarding the Company’s current products and research and developments efforts. The boards will vary by cancer type/site and the supporting specialties that treat that cancer. They will include, but not be limited to, radiation oncologists, surgeons, urologists, and physicists. The boards will be a mix of customers and non-customers, which the Company believes will provide increased insight regarding the perception of its products and opportunities to meet the needs of the market. The Company held its first advisory meeting for prostate cancer in September 2016. The Company held its most recent meeting in June 2019 and is planning on continuing this strategy. The Company is looking to continue to build additional advisory boards as the other applications grow in viability.
 
The market for treatments of localized prostate cancer is very competitive and largely hinges upon two factors: the demonstration of long-term follow-up data that has been presented to the prostate cancer treatment profession and the economic and strategic dynamics of the different therapeutic options. Cesium-131 was introduced to the prostate cancer marketplace more than a decade after Iodine-125 and Palladium-103, and the resulting time for mature clinical data to be developed has proven an obstacle to widespread market acceptance. The time to publish these results is lengthy and includes time to enroll patients in protocols which may take multiple years depending on the size of the enrollment population, time to aggregate the results at five years from the final patient treatment, time to analyze the data and author the article followed by the time for peer review, and publication in a medical journal. The total time for this process may approach a decade from start to publication and these long-term results are just beginning to be published at the end of fiscal year 2019. The first long term data are emerging for Cesium-131 prostate brachytherapy, primarily from The Chicago Prostate Cancer Center.
 
The prostate brachytherapy market has been pressured by the economic differences and strategic dynamics of competing treatment options such as robotic surgical devices and external beam radiation facilities. These factors have combined to result in the current multi-year contraction of the prostate brachytherapy market. The declining market has impacted the competitive landscape, reducing the number of competitors and their respective investments in sales, marketing and product development efforts. Based upon Company market review and research, there appears to be an opportunity for Isoray to expand its current market opportunity with an investment in sales and marketing efforts. The Company believes its hires of both sales and marketing veterans with regional sales support will lead to growth of their market share in the prostate cancer treatment business. The Company also believes that an increased share of the prostate brachytherapy market share will assist in facilitating Cesium-131 brachytherapy cancer treatment growth in other body sites.
 
The professional and patient market segments each play a role in the ultimate choice of cancer treatment and the specific isotope chosen for seed brachytherapy treatment. The Company has developed a customized brand message for each audience. The Company’s new website was launched in the fall of 2016 and delivers the message that Cesium-131 is a treatment option for cancers throughout the body. Isoray continues to develop and/or refresh print, visual and digital media (including physician brochures discussing the clinical advantages of Cesium-131, clinical information materials, and digital content for the website and social media awareness efforts). In addition, the Company attends national professional meetings, including:

In today’s U.S. health care market, patients are more informed and involved in the management of their health than in the past. Many physicians relate incidents of their patients coming for consultations armed with articles researched on the Internet and other sources describing new treatments and medications. In many cases, these patients are demanding a certain therapy or drug and the physicians are complying when medically appropriate.
 
Because of this consumer-driven market factor, we also promote our products directly to the general public. We target the prostate cancer patient, his spouse, family, care givers and loved ones. We emphasize to these segments the specific advantages of the Cesium-131 brachytherapy seed through our website (located at www.Isoray.com), patient advocacy efforts, informational patient materials and patient testimonials, other awareness efforts through social media channels, and advertisements in specific markets supporting brachytherapy. None of our websites should be considered a part of this Report. Over the past year, the Company has continued to increase its efforts to raise awareness about Cesium-131 and Isoray Medical. One key method we have pursued for this is to increase our digital footprint, with consistent updates to our website and outreaches through social media, including Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. These efforts have resulted in significant year over year growth in web traffic (50.1% increase in total visitors), new visitors (48.52% increase) and organic search results (71.5% increase in resulting site traffic). The Company believes that an increased digital presence will result in increased awareness about brachytherapy overall, and specifically increased awareness about Cesium-131. Management believes this increased awareness should ultimately translate to more patients finding a physician with Cesium-131 experience.
 
The Company’s marketing plan with regard to non-prostate segments includes identifying and exhibiting at scientific meetings attended by specialty physicians who perform procedures related to Company’s product offerings, direct sales contact with such physicians (for example thoracic surgeons and neuro-surgeons), the development and dissemination of training videos and other media that outline the Company’s products, and the implementation of local training events to provide product and procedure information to potential customers. 
 
Further, the Company is partnering with key clinicians within each application to support early experiences and identify additional facilities that may be interested in the applications. The Company continues to work with its existing radiation oncology physician customers and to educate them as to additional or new Company products and expand utility of Cesium-131 within the facility and across different disease sites. To facilitate this expanded position, the Company’s sales managers call on existing radiation oncology physicians and other key decision makers within an organization to discuss the available clinical results and experiences in coordination with key Company scientific personnel to educate the customer representatives about different Cesium-131 applications and comparisons to competing treatments.

Sales and Distribution
 
In the prostate cancer market, the sales organization targets radiation oncologists and medical physicists as well as urologists and facility administrators as key clinical decision-makers in the type of radiation therapy offered to prostate cancer patients.
 
With respect to non-prostate applications, the Company targets neurosurgeons, thoracic surgeons, gynecologic oncologists and other surgeons in addition to radiation oncologists. After these clinicians identify the value of the Company’s Cesium-131 products, the Company then also needs support for the procedure from the medical physicists on staff and facility administrators. The sales cycle for non-prostate applications has proved to be a longer process than for prostate applications and often takes nine months or longer before the Company is licensed in a new hospital and can make its first sale.
 
Isoray has a direct sales organization consisting of territory sales managers, and a Vice-President of Sales and Marketing responsible for the development of the team and the execution of the sales plan. The Company’s territory sales managers are responsible for all sales activities in their respective territories and solicit potential specialist physicians in all areas of the body. This approach allows our territory sales managers to call on a single location for all applications of our products, resulting in a more efficient sales approach.
 
The sales organization is fully committed to and is in the process of executing the commercial plan for the development of new sales materials, training materials, and website assistance. Further, the marketing team supports the development of the company brand. Finally, the sales organization continues to work with the Research and Development team to help in the development of new products and advancements to support customer brachytherapy needs.
 
The Company expects to continue to explore the opportunity to extend its customer base outside the U.S. market through use of established distributors in target markets of other countries. As of September 2019, the Company had independent distributors in Russia and Peru. The Company’s initial focus on the international markets was for the sale of the GliaSite ® RTS, which was discontinued in March 2016. This has shifted to targeted prostate and gynecological centers in the targeted markets. Although it has international distribution agreements in place, the Company continues to experience difficulties in generating sales of Cesium-131 products through its international distributors. In addition, the Company’s decision to not renew its CE mark during fiscal year 2019 will limit its ability to sell to countries within the European Union.
 
Reimbursement
 
Reimbursement by third party payers is the primary means of payment for all Isoray products. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is the primary payer, providing coverage for approximately 65% of all prostate brachytherapy cases and a majority of non-prostate procedures. Well established brachytherapy coverage and payment policies are currently in place by CMS and other non-governmental payers for out-patient procedures. For surgical procedures provided in an in-patient setting, payment is provided as part of a DRG code, which includes the surgical elements of the procedure.
 
In the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (HOPPS) out-patient setting, brachytherapy sources are legislated to be paid individually. Under this umbrella, in 2003, CMS established a unique HCPCS code for Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds that permitted providers to report the use of Cesium-131 directly to payers. In July 2007, CMS established two separate Cesium-131 codes for providers to report loose seeds and stranded seeds due to the cost differential of these two products. Reimbursement for prostate brachytherapy services and sources is well established in the U.S. and most providers (hospitals and physicians) are not faced with reimbursement challenges when providing this treatment option to patients. 
 
As noted above, there are currently two different methodologies for CMS payment. The first, the out-patient setting, includes prostate brachytherapy, and a limited range of other procedures, including some gynecological implants, and as such, is covered by the CMS Outpatient Prospective Payment System, which since 2010 has provided a fixed reimbursement per seed for stranded and loose seeds. Iodine, Palladium and Cesium each have their own reimbursement values for stranded and loose seeds. If reported correctly when seeds are submitted for payment to CMS, providers are reimbursed at a flat rate that is determined by median costs of the seeds.  CMS has generally continued its historical trend of declining year over year reimbursement with few exceptions. Private insurance companies have historically followed the CMS reimbursement policies. The Company expects that CMS will continue its annual review of payments provided as reimbursement for our various products.
 
The other payment method is for in-patient procedures, where the patient remains in the hospital for more than 24 hours. Lung, brain and head and neck implant procedures utilizing brachytherapy sources require the patient to be admitted to the hospital. In-patient procedures are covered by CMS which remits a set amount depending on the type of surgery being performed and the complexity of the surgery. Under this Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) system, the hospital pays for all the items involved in the care of the patient excluding physician fees. The brachytherapy seeds in these in-patient cases are not paid for separately by CMS, but rather included as part of the DRG payments from CMS. Because the Company’s seeds may not be reimbursed by CMS, there can be difficulty in convincing hospitals to use the Company’s products. The Company contracted with a reimbursement consultant in April of 2016 to review opportunities to establish incremental reimbursement from CMS for in-patient care for brachytherapy. In September 2019, the Company submitted for an additional ICD-10-PCS code for other surgical procedures and is currently waiting on CMS’s response. The Company plans on considering additional applications for ICD-10-PCS codes for in-patient brachytherapy treatments in the future. Receipt of additional ICD-10-PCS codes in the future for brachytherapy applications will assist in the sales to hospitals and institutions that currently are not reimbursed for brachytherapy radiation for in-patient care. Management believes the lack of incremental reimbursement by CMS and private insurers for brachytherapy placed at the time of surgery rather than delivered at a point in time following surgery may be impeding the faster and broader adoption of in-patient brachytherapy.
 
 19


In July 2019, CMS proposed a significant change to the way Medicare currently pays for radiation services in an out-patient setting. If this change proposed by CMS is enacted, the Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Method (RO APM) would provide for a single, bundled payment for a 90-day episode of radiation therapy including LDR brachytherapy, IMRT, SBRT, proton therapy, and HDR brachytherapy. The RO APM proposal would apply the same payment levels to services provided in physician offices, free-standing centers, and hospital outpatients and would be mandatory for approximately forty percent of the facilities in the United States. In addition, certain surgical codes are included in the bundled payment such as those for gynecological treatments. This CMS proposal for a revised payment includes brachytherapy sources which contradicts the current Congressional mandate to provide separate payment for brachytherapy sources. All comments regarding the RO APM were due to CMS by mid-September 2019 and the Company submitted its comments prior to the deadline. The final rule could become effective for calendar year 2020 if CMS proceeds with little or no changes to the proposed RO APM. Management is currently evaluating the impact that RO APM would have if implemented as currently written.
 
GT Med Tech filed an application for a New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) seeking reimbursement for the GammaTile™ treatment in the in-patient setting. In August 2019, CMS issued a ruling that GammaTile™ Therapy was not approved for an NTAP. Despite the lack of an NTAP code, GT Med Tech has reimbursement for GammaTile™ under ICD-10PCS-00H004Z and MS-DRG 023 which reimburses hospitals in the inpatient setting and will continue to roll out its sales and marketing strategy for release of GammaTile™.

Customers
 
The following are the Company’s top three customers, facilities or physician practices that utilize multiple surgical facilities at which primarily prostate brachytherapy procedures are performed, which accounted for approximately 35.2% of the total Company sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019:

Facility | Location | % of revenue | 
-------------------------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+-----
El Camino, Los Gatos, and other facilities1 | Northern CA | | 22.1 | %
Longview Regional Medical Center, and other facilities | TX | | 7.4 | %
University of Pittsburg Medical Center – Mercy | PA | | 5.7 | %
Total | | | 35.2 | %


1. | The head of the single largest physician practice also serves as the Company’s medical director. As the medical director, this physician advises the Company Board of Directors and management, provides technical advice related to product development and research and development, and provides internal training to the Company sales staff and professional training to our sales staff and to other physicians. Revenue from this practice increased by $183,000 in the year ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. This increase was due to the addition of new centers located by the regional manager and within the practice range of the medical director.

The loss of either the single largest physician practice or a combination of the other significant facilities and customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, which would continue until the Company located new customers to replace them. There can be no assurance this would occur in a timely manner or at all.
 
Advanced Radiation Centers of NY was a top three customer in fiscal year 2018. While not a top three customer in fiscal year 2019, Advanced Radiation Centers of NY is still a substantial customer.

Our management believes that certain aspects of the Isoray seed design and construction techniques are patentable innovations. These innovations resulted in a patent granted by the USPTO under Patent Number 7,410,458, in August 2008, with an expiration date of December 5, 2025. Certain methodologies regarding isotope production, separation, and seed manufacture are retained as trade secrets and are embodied in Isoray’s procedures and documentation. Four patents have been granted by the USPTO relating to methods of deriving Cesium-131 developed by Isoray employees: Patent Number 7,479,261, with an expiration date of April 6, 2027; Patent Number 7,531,150, with an expiration date of July 13, 2027; Patent Number 7,316,644, with an expiration date of August 5, 2025; and Patent Number 7,510,691, with an expiration date of July 19, 2027. One patent has been granted by the USPTO relating to a device for loading brachytherapy seeds: Patent Number 10,328,278, with an expiration date in October 2038. The Company has two patents that were issued on April 23, 2014 and are effective in Canada (Canada 2576907 and 2571349). The Company has patents granted in the Russian Federation which expire at various times in 2024 and 2025. The Company has a single patent granted in each of the Netherlands and India that both expire on June 22, 2025. The Company has a single patent pending in the EU and Hong Kong. The Company is continuing its efforts to develop and patent additional methods of deriving Cesium-131 and other isotopes.
 
There were specific conditions attached to the assignment of the Cesium-131 Trust patent from the late Lane Bray. In particular, the associated Royalty Agreement provided for 1% of gross profit payment from seed sales to Lane Bray and 1% of gross profit from any use of the Cesium-131 process patent for non-seed products. If Isoray reassigned the Royalty Agreement to another company, these royalties increased to 2%. The Royalty Agreement had an anti-shelving clause that required Isoray to return the patent if Isoray permanently abandoned sales of products using the invention. During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded royalty expense of $33,000 and $27,000, respectively, related to this patent. The patent expired in April 2019 and no royalties were paid on sales after the expiration of the patent. The Company has changed and improved its processes over time and was only using a small part of the methodology described in the patent at the time of its expiration.  While others can now use the methodologies described in the patent without infringing, management believes that its proprietary processes covered either by other valid patents or by know-how still provide some barriers to entry for anyone wanting to produce a Cesium-131 brachytherapy seed and also allow the Company to more efficiently manufacture Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds than using the methods listed in the expired patent.
 
Research and Development
 
During the two-year period ended June 30, 2019, Isoray and its subsidiaries incurred approximately $3.22 million in costs related to research and development activities. The Company expects to continue ongoing research and development activities for the foreseeable future. Chief among R&D expenditures in fiscal year 2019 were new product development (Blu Build™ loader, GammaTile™ and others) and the support of clinical research studies that are accumulating data on the subjects of prostate, brain and head and neck cancers. Other clinical research, including the study of Cesium-131 in the treatment of gynecological and other cancers, are currently funded by sources other than the Company.
Government Regulation
 
The Company’s present and future intended activities in the development, manufacture and sale of cancer therapy products are subject to extensive laws, regulations, regulatory approvals and guidelines. Within the United States, the Company’s therapeutic radiological devices must comply with the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which is enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Company is also required to adhere to applicable FDA Quality System Regulations, also known as the Good Manufacturing Practices, which include extensive record keeping and periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities. The Company’s predecessor obtained FDA 510(k) clearance in March 2003 to market its Cesium-131 seed for the treatment of localized solid tumors and other malignant disease and Isoray obtained FDA 510(k) clearance in November 2006 to market preloaded brachytherapy seeds and in August 2009 for preloading flexible braided strands and bioabsorbable mesh. In July 2018 the Company obtained 510(k) clearance for the GammaTile™ Therapy which it subsequently transferred to GT Med Tech per the Collaborative Development Agreement executed in March 2017.
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates, among other things, new product clearances and approvals to establish the safety and efficacy of these products. We are also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Environmental Protection Act.
 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, distribution, use, reporting, advertising and promotion of such products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in civil penalties, recall, injunction or seizure of products, refusal of the government to approve or clear product approval applications, disqualification from sponsoring or conducting clinical investigations, preventing us from entering into government supply contracts, withdrawal of previously approved applications, and criminal prosecution.

In the United States, medical devices are classified into three different categories over which the FDA applies increasing levels of regulation: Class I, Class II, and Class III. Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification 510(k); most Class II devices require premarket notification 510(k); and most Class III devices require premarket approval. Our Cesium-131 seed is a Class II device and received 510(k) clearance in March 2003.
 
Approval of new Class III medical devices is a lengthy procedure and can take a number of years and require the expenditure of significant resources. There is a shorter FDA review and clearance process for Class II medical devices, the premarket notification or 510(k) process, whereby a company can market certain Class II medical devices that can be shown to be substantially equivalent to other legally marketed devices. Since brachytherapy seeds have been classified by the FDA as a Class II device, we have been able to achieve market clearance for our Cesium-131 seed using the 510(k) process.
 
As a registered medical device manufacturer with the FDA, we are subject to inspection to ensure compliance with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. These regulations require that we and any of our contract manufacturers design, manufacture and service products, and maintain documents in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, distribution, storage, design control, and service activities. Modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of a device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device require a new 510(k) premarket notification for any significant product modification.
 
The Medical Device Reporting regulation requires that we provide information to the FDA on deaths or serious injuries alleged to be associated with the use of our devices, as well as product malfunctions that are likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Labeling and promotional activities are regulated by the FDA and, in some circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission.
 
As a medical device manufacturer, we are also subject to laws and regulations administered by governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels. For example, our facility is licensed as a medical device manufacturing facility in the State of Washington and is subject to periodic state regulatory inspections. Our customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us.
 
In support of the Company’s global strategy to expand marketing to Russia and other strategic countries, the Company determined in FY 2018 it needed to migrate to the ISO 13485:2016 standard. In April 2018, BSI certified the Company’s successful transition to ISO 13485:2016. This transition moved Isoray’s quality system into the current state of the art Quality Management System per the ISO Medical Device Quality Management System standard. It was imperative that the Company complied with ISO 13485:2016 by end of February 2019 in order to maintain its CE Marks. During the fiscal year 2014, the CE Mark was renewed for an additional five years. However, during fiscal year 2019, the Company elected to not to renew its CE Mark due to no sales activity in the European Union, limited interest in Cesium-131 due to the pricing and reimbursement environment, and changing European Union registration requirements that would have required significant investment into additional clinical trials.

In the United States, as a manufacturer of medical devices and devices utilizing radioactive byproduct material, we are subject to extensive regulation by not only federal governmental authorities, such as the FDA and FAA, but also by state and local governmental authorities, such as the Washington State Department of Health, to ensure such devices are safe and effective. In Washington State, the Department of Health, by agreement with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), regulates the possession, use, and disposal of radioactive byproduct material as well as the manufacture of radioactive sealed sources to ensure compliance with state and federal laws and regulations. Our Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds constitute both medical devices and radioactive sealed sources and are subject to these regulations.
 
Moreover, our use, management, and disposal of certain radioactive substances and wastes are subject to regulation by several federal and state agencies depending on the nature of the substance or waste material. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal and state regulations for this purpose.
 
The Company believes the costs to comply with various federal, state, and local environmental laws include such costs as radioactive waste disposal, radioactive material licenses, and increased shipping costs related to the radioactivity of our products are less than $100,000 annually.
 
Seasonality
 
The Company believes that some seed implantation procedures are deferred around physician vacations (particularly in the summer months), holidays, and medical conventions and conferences resulting in a seasonal influence on the Company’s business. These factors cause a momentary decline in revenue which management believes is ultimately realized in prior or following periods. Because a material portion of the Company’s business is dependent on three customers, physician practices or facilities, simultaneous or extended vacations by the physicians at these facilities or by our single largest physician whose total revenue alone represents a material portion of the Company’s business could cause significant drops in the Company’s productivity during those reporting periods.
Employees
 
As of September 19, 2019, Isoray employed 43 full-time individuals. The Company’s future success will depend, in part, on its ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified sales, technical and management personnel. From time to time, the Company may employ independent consultants or contractors to support its research and development, marketing, sales, accounting and administrative organizations. None of the Company’s employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit. On September 19, 2019, the Company employed six direct sales people.
Competition
 
The Company competes in a market characterized by technological innovation, extensive research efforts, and significant competition. In general, the Isoray Cesium-131 brachytherapy seed competes with conventional methods of treating localized cancer, including, but not limited to, all forms of prostatectomy surgery and external beam radiation therapy which includes intensity modulated radiation therapy, stereotactic radiosurgery and proton therapy, as well as competing permanent and temporary brachytherapy devices.
 
Management believes the Company’s patented Cesium-131 separation process is likely to provide a sustainable competitive advantage and maintain the Company as the sole producer of medical Cesium-131. Production of Cesium-131 also requires specialized facilities that represent high cost and long lead time if not readily available. In addition, a competitor would need to develop a method for isotope attachment and seed assembly, would need to conduct testing to meet NRC and FDA requirements, and would need to obtain regulatory clearances before marketing a competing device. Best Medical received FDA 510(k) clearance to market a Cesium-131 seed on June 6, 1993 but to date, twenty-six years later, have not produced any products for sale.
 
The permanent brachytherapy seed market includes companies that manufacture and/or distribute Cesium-131, Iodine-125 (I-125) and Palladium-103 (Pd-103). The Company believes the performance characteristics of Cesium-131, specifically the shorter half-life and higher energy than either Pd-103 or I-125, will ultimately prove to be advantageous. Both other permanent brachytherapy isotopes, I-125 and Pd-103 were introduced to the market prior to Cesium-131, allowing many customers to become comfortable with the performance of both isotopes and requiring the Company to overcome these preferences to convert customers to Cesium-131.

Key competitors who provide permanent prostate brachytherapy products include: Theragenics Corporation, Becton-Dickinson (formerly C. R. Bard), IsoAid, and Best Medical. While none of these companies publicly report specific information about their brachytherapy business, the Company believes the following about their product offerings and market positions:
 

● | Theragenics Corporation introduced Pd-103 into the market approximately 20 years ago. They are the market leader in Pd-103 production. In the 2000’s, Theragenics introduced their own I-125 product. They deliver product in a variety of configurations, include products that allow for intra-operative needle preparation and stranding. They also provide product (primarily I-125) for international distribution. The majority of their brachytherapy sales are for prostate treatment. They manufacture Pd-103 for Becton Dickinson.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Becton-Dickinson (“BD”, Previously C. R. Bard) manufactures their own I-125 and distribute Pd-103 from Theragenics. They are a prior market leader, and historically focused on dedicated delivery devices to support different physician procedure techniques. They continue to distribute I-125 internationally, with the majority of their brachytherapy sales for prostate treatment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | IsoAid manufactures both I-125 and Pd-103, with a focus on domestic prostate brachytherapy customers. They have focused on providing seeds to customers in standard configurations. The Company does not believe that IsoAid offers a product for intra-operative needle preparation and stranding.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Best Medical manufactures both I-125 and Pd-103, with a focus on domestic prostate brachytherapy customers. They have focused on providing seeds to customers in standard configurations. The Company does not believe that Best Medical offers a product for intra-operative needle preparation and stranding.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company believes that customers perform prostate brachytherapy procedures via one of several general procedure techniques, including (but not limited to): Pre-plan techniques, Intra-operative techniques, and Real-time techniques. Further, the Company believes that customers are comfortable with their techniques and want products to facilitate their preferred methods. All of the above competitors provide a set of standard products (including loose seeds, seeds loaded in cartridges, and seeds pre-loaded in needles) to meet the customer needs. Theragenics and BD have products that support intra-operative and real-time techniques that allow for stranding or linking seeds together in custom configurations in the operating room. This allows physicians to gain the benefits of stranded or linked seeds while still allowing for customization to the patient anatomy, as determined at the time of the procedure. The Company believes that approximately 25% of procedures are performed with some level of customization in the operating room.
 
It is this segment of the market – customer looking to customize their procedures to the anatomy at the time of the procedure – that the Company expects to address with their new Blu Build™ loading device. The Blu Build™ loading device will efficiently configure strands in the operating room, allowing the clinician to make determinations about the product configurations with the most recent picture of the patient’s anatomy. The Company believes that this technique may provide advantages in some brachytherapy products and will provide a better solution for this market segment. The Company also believes the efficiency and ease of use of the Blu Build™ loading device will offer an intriguing opportunity for the other 75% of the market. Blu Build™ was sold in a limited market release during fiscal year 2019 as the Company worked to refine the loader before wide-spread distribution. The Company anticipates a full market release of Blu Build™ in the first half of fiscal year 2020, but there is no assurance this will occur.
 
The Company’s brachytherapy products used in non-prostate applications typically compete with temporary (high dose-rate, HDR) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), which can be provided as conventional or intensity modulated radiation therapy, or as stereotactic radiosurgery, a technique that delivers high doses of radiation to a target in a much lower number of sessions than other forms of EBRT. Manufacturers of EBRT equipment include Varian Medical Systems, Siemens Healthcare, Elekta AB, and Accuray Incorporated, among others.
