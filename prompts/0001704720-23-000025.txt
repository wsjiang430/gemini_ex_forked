Item 1.    Business  
Introductory Note
The following describes the business of Cannae Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Except where otherwise noted, all references to "we," "us," "our," "Cannae", "Cannae Holdings", or the "Company," are to Cannae Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken together.
Company Background
On November 17, 2017, Fidelity National Financial, Inc. ("FNF", NYSE: FNF) redeemed each outstanding share of its FNF Ventures ("FNFV") Group common stock, par value $0.0001, for one share of common stock, par value $0.0001, of a newly formed entity, Cannae (the "Split-Off"). In conjunction with the Split-Off, FNF contributed to us its portfolio of companies unrelated to its primary insurance and real estate operations, which included majority and minority equity interests in a number of entities and certain fixed income investments. On November 20, 2017, Cannae common stock began "regular-way" trading on The New York Stock Exchange under the "CNNE" stock symbol.
Description of Business
We primarily acquire interests in operating companies and are engaged in actively managing and operating a core group of those companies, which we are committed to supporting for the long term. From time to time, we also seek to take meaningful equity ownership stakes where we have the ability to control or significantly influence quality companies, and we bring the strength of our operational expertise to each of our subsidiaries. We are a long-term owner that secures control and governance rights of other companies primarily to engage in their lines of business and we have no preset time constraints dictating when we sell or dispose of our businesses. We believe that our long-term ownership and active involvement in the management and operations of companies helps maximize the value of those businesses for our shareholders. Our primary assets as of December 31, 2022 include our ownership interests in Dun & Bradstreet Holdings, Inc. ("Dun & Bradstreet" or "D&B"); Ceridian HCM Holding, Inc. ("Ceridian"); Alight, Inc. ("Alight"); Paysafe Limited ("Paysafe"); Sightline Payments Holdings, LLC ("Sightline" or "Sightline Payments"); System1, Inc. ("System1"); Black Knight Football and Entertainment, LP ("BKFE"); Computer Services, Inc. ("CSI"); AmeriLife Group, LLC ("AmeriLife"); O'Charley's Holdings, LLC ("O'Charley's"); 99 Restaurants Holdings, LLC ("99 Restaurants"); and various other controlled portfolio companies and minority equity ownership interests. 
The Company conducts its business through its wholly-owned subsidiary Cannae Holdings, LLC ("Cannae LLC"), a Delaware limited liability company. The Company’s board of directors ("Board") oversees the management of the Company, Cannae LLC and its businesses, and the performance of Trasimene Capital Management, LLC ("Trasimene" or our "Manager"). During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, the Company transitioned to an externally managed structure (such externalization of certain management functions, the "Externalization"). In connection with the Externalization, the Company, Cannae LLC, and our Manager entered into a Management Services Agreement dated as of August 27, 2019, as amended and restated on August 4, 2021 (as amended and restated, the "Management Services Agreement").
We believe our operating structure provides our investors with a compelling opportunity to participate in the acquisition, operation and growth of businesses by a world-class management team. Fundamentally, the Company seeks to take meaningful equity ownership stakes where we have an ability to control or significantly influence quality companies that are well-positioned in their respective industries, run by best-in-class management teams and that operate in industries that have attractive organic and acquired growth opportunities. Led by William P. Foley II ("Bill Foley") and facilitated through our Manager, we leverage our management team's operational expertise, long-term relationships and industry connections and capital sourcing capabilities to identify, structure and execute on ownership interests in companies with these characteristics. 
Our management team has a proven track record of growing industry-leading companies, and we continuously work with and support management teams of the companies we own in managing, operating, and growing their businesses in order to provide value for our shareholders. Bill Foley-led management teams are responsible for the growth of publicly traded companies such as FNF, Black Knight, Inc. ("Black Knight", NYSE: BKI), Ceridian, D&B, Fidelity National Information Services ("FNIS", NYSE: FIS) and F&G Annuities & Life, Inc. ("FG", NYSE: FG), which collectively have a market capitalization of more than $85 billion. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had the following reportable segments:
Dun & Bradstreet. This segment consists of our 18.1% ownership interest in D&B. Cannae's chairman Bill Foley and CEO Richard Massey serve on the board of directors of D&B. Dun & Bradstreet is a leading global provider of business decisioning data and analytics. Its mission is to deliver a global network of trust, enabling clients to transform uncertainty into confidence, risk into opportunity and potential into prosperity. Clients embed D&B's trusted, end-to-end solutions into their daily workflows to enhance salesforce productivity, gain visibility into key markets, inform commercial credit decisions and confirm 
Table of Contents

that suppliers are financially viable and compliant with laws and regulations. Dun & Bradstreet's solutions support its clients’ mission critical business operations by providing proprietary and curated data and analytics to help drive informed decisions and improved outcomes.
Dun & Bradstreet is differentiated by the scale, depth, diversity and accuracy of its constantly expanding business database that contains comprehensive information on hundreds of millions of businesses. Access to longitudinal curated data is critical for global commerce, and with only a small percentage of the world’s businesses filing public financial statements, D&B data is a trusted source for reliable information about both public and private businesses. By building such a set of data over time, D&B was able to establish a unique identifier that creates a single thread connecting related corporate entities allowing its clients to form a holistic view of an enterprise. This unique identifier, which D&B refers to as the D-U-N-S Number, is a corporate ‘‘fingerprint’’ or ‘‘Social Security Number’’ of businesses. D&B believes that it is the only scale provider to possess both worldwide commercial credit data and comprehensive public records data that are linked together by a unique identifier allowing for an accurate assessment of public and private businesses globally. D&B generates its revenue primarily through subscription-based contractual arrangements that it enters into with its clients to provide data, analytics and analytics-related services either individually, or as part of an integrated offering of multiple services. These arrangements occasionally include offerings from more than one business unit to the same client.
We account for our ownership of Dun & Bradstreet using the equity method of accounting; therefore, its results of operations do not consolidate into ours.
Alight. This segment consists of our 9.7% ownership interest in Alight. Cannae's chairman Bill Foley, CEO Richard Massey and director Erika Meinhardt serve on the board of directors of D&B. Alight is a leading cloud-based provider of integrated digital human capital and business solutions. Alight has an unwavering belief that a company’s success starts with its people, and its solutions connect human insights with technology. Leveraging artificial intelligence and data analytics, Alight provides an integrated, personalized experience for employees using technology-driven solutions that aim to unlock value for employers. Alight believes its mission-critical solutions enable employees to enrich their health, wealth and wellbeing, which helps global organizations achieve a high-performance culture. Alight serves more than 36 million employees and family members from a broad range of clients, including Fortune 500 companies and mid-market businesses. Alight seeks to establish high-quality, strong, long-term relationships with its clients. 
We account for our ownership of Alight using the equity method of accounting; therefore, its results of operations do not consolidate into ours.
Paysafe. This segment consists of our 5.6% ownership interest in Paysafe. Paysafe is a leading payments platform with an extensive track record of serving merchants and consumers in the global entertainment sectors. Its core purpose is to enable businesses and consumers to connect and transact seamlessly through industry-leading capabilities in payment processing, digital wallet, and online cash solutions.
We account for our ownership of Paysafe using the equity method of accounting; therefore, its results of operations do not consolidate into ours.
Restaurant Group. This segment consists of the operations of O'Charley's and 99 Restaurants in which we have 65.4% and 88.5% equity ownership interests, respectively. O'Charley's and 99 Restaurants and their affiliates are the owners and operators of the O'Charley's restaurant and Ninety Nine Restaurants restaurant concepts, respectively.
We account for our ownership of the Restaurant Group as a consolidated subsidiary.
Sightline. This segment consists of our 32.4% ownership interest in Sightline Payments. Sightline Payments is a leading digital payments provider and mobile application developer to the United States' sports betting and casino gaming market. Sightline leverages cutting-edge technology to apply modern solutions to a traditionally cash-based casino industry projected to grow significantly over the next few years. While much of the business world shifts to a cashless society, the casino gaming industry is known for being cash dominant. Sightline's mission is to be the preeminent partner in transitioning toward cashless casino gaming. Sightline’s Play+ solution gives consumers a safe, secure, and responsible way to fund their online and in-person gaming activities and enables casinos to offer cashless wagering and payment options across the entire property. With a large and expanding customer base and partners across the sports betting, lottery, racing, and online and brick-and-mortar casino markets, Sightline is uniquely positioned to transform the traditional gaming landscape.
We account for our ownership of Sightline using the equity method of accounting; therefore, its results of operations do not consolidate into ours.
Corporate and Other. This aggregation of nonreportable operating segments consists of our share in the operations of controlled and uncontrolled portfolio companies including our 3.9% ownership interest in Ceridian, 24.0% ownership interest in System1, 50.1% limited partnership interest in BKFE, 4.6% ownership interest in AmeriLife, 9.1% ownership interest in CSI,

Strategy and Business Trends
Our strategy for the Company is to continue to manage and operate the diversified businesses of our group of companies to create long-term growth of those businesses in order to maximize the value of those businesses for our shareholders, and to pursue similar strategies and objectives when taking significant ownership stakes in new businesses.
Dun & Bradstreet. We believe that Dun & Bradstreet has an attractive business model that is underpinned by highly recurring, diversified revenues, significant operating leverage, low capital requirements and strong free cash flow. The proprietary and embedded nature of its data and analytics solutions and the integral role that D&B plays in its clients’ decision-making processes have translated into high client retention and revenue visibility. D&B has had relationships with most of its top clients by revenue for more than 20 years, which reflects how deeply embedded D&B is in its clients' daily workflows and decisioning processes. D&B exhibits strong annual revenue retention rates and substantially all of its clients are recurring year over year. Dun & Bradstreet also benefits from strong operating leverage given its centralized database and solutions, which allows it to generate strong contribution margins and free cash flow.

Subsequent to our acquisition of an ownership stake in D&B in the first quarter of 2019, we worked closely with D&B to begin quickly implementing changes to address operational and execution issues at D&B that led to stagnant revenue growth and declining profitability over the last decade. We immediately brought in a new senior leadership team, which commenced a comprehensive transformation to improve and revitalize D&B's business for long-term success. The new senior leadership team saw significant opportunity to create value by transforming the organization and improving the platform with new business unit leaders, enhanced technology and data, solution innovation and a client-centric go-to-market strategy.
D&B's transformation strategy is based on Bill Foley's proven playbook of enhancing stockholder value through organizational re-alignment and re-investment. Initiatives implemented at D&B upon its 2019 leveraged buyout have resulted in significant synergies and cost savings. In light of the changes that have been made or identified by the Company and D&B's management team, we believe D&B is well-positioned to execute on its strategies of driving stockholder value through consistent revenue growth, managing cost initiatives and innovating and improving the way it adds value and solves the increasingly challenging and complex needs of its clients.
Businesses rely on business-to-business data and analytics providers to extract data-driven insights and make better decisions. For example, in commercial lending and trade credit, the scarcity of readily available credit history makes the extension of credit a time-consuming and imprecise process. In procurement, businesses face increasingly complex and global supply chains, making the assessment of compliance and viability of all suppliers prohibitively difficult and expensive if not conducted effectively. In sales and marketing, businesses have benefited from the proliferation of customer relationship management, Marketing Automation and Sales Acceleration tools designed to help identify, track and improve both customer management and prospecting growth activities. While these tools are helping to fill sales funnels and improve the progression of opportunities, key challenges remain in salesforce productivity, effective client segmentation and marketing campaign activation. Common stumbling blocks include incorrect, or outdated, contact information, duplicated or inaccurate firmographic data and a lack of synchronization between the various platforms in the marketing technology ecosystem.
D&B helps its clients solve these mission critical business problems. D&B believes the total addressable market (‘‘TAM’’) in which it operates is large, growing and significantly underpenetrated. D&B participates in the big data and analytics software market, as defined by Interactive Data Corporation, or IDC, which represents a collection of software markets that functionally address decision support and decision automation. This market includes business intelligence and analytics tools, analytic data management and integration platforms and analytics and performance management applications. Within the broader market of data and analytics solutions, D&B serves a number of different markets, including the commercial credit data, sales and marketing data and Governance, Risk and Compliance ("GRC") markets to provide clients with decisioning support and automation. As D&B continues to drive innovation in its solutions, it expects to address a greater portion of this TAM as new use cases for its data assets and analytical capabilities are introduced.
D&B believes there are several key trends in the global macroeconomic environment generating additional growth in D&B's TAM and increasing the demand for its solutions, including growing recognition by business of the value of analytics and data-informed business decisioning, growth in data creation and applications driven by the proliferation of new technologies with new data sets and applications, advances in analytical capabilities that are unlocking the value of data, and heightened compliance requirements in the regulatory environment for business driven by the growth of new technologies.
Alight. There are many factors today impacting how organizations can succeed and thrive in the future. Employees are facing increasing complexity around healthcare and retirement, and the burden of additional financial responsibility from healthcare costs being shifted from employers to employees. We believe these trends have driven the need for integrated, personalized tools to help them make informed decisions. Employers are facing ever-changing workforce regulations and evolving dynamics across the employer/employee relationship, driving the need for flexibility, engagement and effective solutions for compliance. We believe Alight is uniquely positioned between the employer and employee to address these factors to ultimately drive better outcomes for both.
Alight aims to be the pre-eminent employee engagement partner by providing personalized experiences that help employees make the best decisions for themselves and their families about their health, wealth and wellbeing every day. At the same time, Alight helps employers tackle their biggest people and business challenges by helping them understand prevalence, trends and risks to generate better outcomes for the future and get a return on their people investment. Using data, analytics and AI, Alight derives actionable insights to deliver the business and people outcomes organizations need. Alight provides solutions to manage health and retirement benefits, tools for payroll and HR management, as well as solutions to manage the workforce from the cloud.
Paysafe. Paysafe empowers approximately 19 million active users in more than 120 countries and over 250,000 businesses across the United States, Canada and Europe to conduct secure and friction-less commerce across online, mobile, in-app and in-store channels, generating most of its revenue from Online and Integrated Commerce solutions. Paysafe focuses on its core verticals, including iGaming (which encompasses a broad selection of online betting related to sports, esports, fantasy sports, poker and other casino games) streaming and online gaming, travel and entertainment, retail and hospitality, and digital assets.

Paysafe believes that an increasing percentage of digital commerce around the world is becoming overly complex for traditional retail payment services, many of which still use legacy business processes and technologies that were developed 10 or more years ago to address an earlier generation of eCommerce. These legacy platforms lack the specialized functionality, sophisticated risk management and robust regulatory compliance infrastructures that Paysafe believes are required to address this large and fast-growing area of the market.
To address this opportunity, Paysafe has developed a suite of innovative, proprietary digital commerce solutions that it deploys across its network, a unique combination of Business to Business ("B2B") and Business to Consumer ("B2C") relationships. These solutions are intended to help (1) solve the complexities of facilitating digital commerce, (2) remove significant friction and pain points from the customer experience, (3) enable Paysafe's business and consumer clients to transact in a faster, safer and more convenient manner and (4) help its business customers grow their operations by bringing active users to their platforms. Paysafe's solutions extend well beyond the basic card-based payments functionality of traditional payment vendors and target an addressable market that is over 2x larger by providing the advanced capabilities of digital wallets, alternative payment methods ("APMs") and digital currency transactions.
Restaurant Group. Our restaurant operations are focused in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry. The Restaurant Group's strategy is to achieve long-term profit growth and drive increases in same store sales and guest counts. We have a highly experienced management team that is focused on enhancing the guest experience at our restaurants and building team member engagement. We also utilize a shared service platform that takes advantage of the combined back-office synergies of our restaurant operating companies. Our goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet for our Restaurant Group to provide stability in all operating environments. 
The restaurant industry is highly competitive and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns; changes in general economic conditions; public safety conditions or concerns; demographic trends; weather conditions; the cost of food products, labor, energy and other operating costs; and governmental regulations. Higher labor costs due to state and local minimum wage increases and shopping pattern shifts to e-commerce and "ready to eat" grocery and convenience stores have had a negative impact on restaurant performance, particularly in the casual dining restaurants in which the company operates. 
The restaurant industry is also characterized by high capital investments for new restaurants and relatively high fixed or semi-variable restaurant operating expenses.  Because of the high fixed and semi-variable expenses, changes in sales in existing restaurants are generally expected to significantly affect restaurant profitability because many restaurant costs and expenses are not expected to change at the same rate as sales. The most significant commodities that may affect our cost of food and beverage are beef, seafood, poultry, and dairy, which accounted for approximately half of our overall cost of food and beverage in the past. Generally, temporary increases in these costs are not passed on to guests; however, in the past, we have adjusted menu prices to compensate for increased costs of a more permanent nature.
The year ended December 31, 2022 was a period of high inflation relative to long-term inflation expectations in the United States. This inflationary environment primarily impacted the commodity and labor costs of our Restaurant Group. We have adjusted menu pricing to account for these cost increases to an extent, but will continue to balance the impact of inflationary pressures on costs with the value proposition offered to customers with a focus on long-term profitability.
Average weekly sales per restaurant are typically higher in the first and fourth quarters than in other quarters, and we typically generate a disproportionate share of our earnings from operations in the first and fourth quarters. Holidays, severe weather and other disruptive conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. 
Our revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors that are beyond our control and, as a result, are likely to fluctuate.
Acquisitions, Dispositions, Minority Owned Operating Affiliates and Financings. Acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy. We may dispose of assets when we identify opportunities to re-allocate our capital to owning, managing, and operating new companies that provide our shareholders with prudent risk-based returns on their own investment in Cannae. On an ongoing basis, with assistance from our Manager and outside advisors, we actively evaluate possible transactions to enhance the value of the companies we own, such as acquisitions of business units and operating assets and business combination transactions.
We primarily engage in various lines of business through long-term ownership together with control or significant influence of companies, though in the future we may seek to sell certain subsidiaries or other assets as part of our capital reallocation initiatives. Further, we may make acquisitions in lines of business that are not directly tied to, or synergistic with, our current operating segments. While we primarily own interests in companies that we control or have the ability to significantly influence the operations of, we have allocated, and expect to allocate in the future, a smaller portion of our capital to minority ownership stakes in companies over which we do not exercise significant influence or have control.
Table of Contents

There can be no assurance that any suitable opportunities will arise or that any particular transaction will be completed. We have made a number of acquisitions and dispositions over the past several years to strengthen and expand the service offerings and customer bases of our businesses, to expand or re-allocate our capital by acquiring significant equity ownership of other businesses or where we otherwise saw value.
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies. In 2020 and early 2021, we made investments in the sponsors of, and forward purchase commitments to purchase equity of, five special purpose acquisition companies ("SPACs"). SPACs are companies formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. As previously disclosed, our previous SPAC investments resulted in our current ownership interests in Paysafe, Alight and System1.
The volume of the total SPACs outstanding and in the market searching for business combination partners increased significantly in late 2020 and early 2021. Additionally, beginning in the second half of 2021 and throughout the course 2022 market participants penalized companies who went public through mergers with SPACs. Indices tracking the market values of companies who went public via mergers with SPACs substantially underperformed the overall market in calendar years 2021 and 2022. 
Prior to such over saturation of the SPAC market, we believed SPACs were an efficient means for private entities to go public and a unique opportunity for companies to partner with sponsors who provide invaluable industry, operational and capital market experience. However, as a result of such market saturation and the deterioration in the market sentiment for SPACs and companies who went public through SPAC mergers, we have paused our prior strategy of raising capital through SPACs. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Cannae and the other sponsors of Austerlitz Acquisition Corporation I ("AAI") and Austerlitz Acquisition Corporation II ("AAII") effected the redemption of AAI's and AAII's outstanding Class A ordinary shares for cash held in their trust accounts. As of December 31, 2022, Cannae had no further investment in AAI or AAII.
While we believe these market trends have in the short term impacted the market values of our ownership interests in companies who went public through SPAC mergers, we remain committed to supporting Paysafe, Alight and System1 and are optimistic about the long-term fundamentals of each business.
Competition
Dun & Bradstreet. Dun & Bradstreet primarily competes on the basis of differentiated data sets, analytical capabilities, solutions, client relationships, innovation and price. D&B believes that it competes favorably in each of these categories across its business segments. D&B's competitors vary based on the client size and geographical markets that its solutions cover.
For Dun & Bradstreet's finance and risk solutions segment, its competition generally varies by client size. D&B has a leading presence in the enterprise market as clients place a high degree of value on our best-in-class commercial credit database to inform their critical decisions around the extension of credit. D&B’s main competitors in the enterprise and mid-market include Bureau van Dijk (owned by Moody’s Corporation), Experian and Creditsafe in Europe and Equifax and Experian in North America. In the small and mid-size company market, commercial credit health becomes increasingly tied to consumer credit health. D&B's competition in this market generally includes Equifax, Experian and other consumer credit providers that offer commercial data. Additionally, there is a fragmented tail of low cost, vertical and regionally focused point solutions in this market that may be attractive to certain clients, but lack the scale and coverage breadth to compete holistically.
For Dun & Bradstreet's sales and marketing solutions segment, its competition has historically been very fragmented with many players offering varying levels of data quantity and quality, and with data being collected in ways that may cross ethical and privacy boundaries. Dun & Bradstreet strives to protect the data and privacy of its clients and to maintain the highest standards in the ethical acquisition, aggregation, curation and delivery of data. D&B's direct competitors vary depending on use cases, such as market segmentation, digital marketing lead generation, lead enrichment, sales effectiveness and data management. In the market for contact data, D&B's competition generally includes ZoomInfo and a few consultancies building bespoke solutions. For other sales and marketing solutions such as customer data platform, visitor intelligence, audience targeting and intent data, D&B faces a number of smaller competitors.
Overall, outside North America, D&B's competitive environment varies by region and country, and can be significantly impacted by the legislative actions of local governments, availability of data and local business preferences. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, D&B's direct competition for its finance and risk solutions segment is primarily from Bureau van Dijk, Creditsafe and Experian. Additionally, in D&B's sales and marketing solutions segment, the landscape in these markets is both localized and fragmented, where numerous local players of varying sizes compete for business. In the Nordics, D&B faces competition from Enento and Experian and in Central and Eastern European markets they compete with several regional and local players. In Asia Pacific, D&B faces competition in its finance and risk solutions segment from a mix of local and global providers. D&B competes with global providers such as Experian and Bureau van Dijk in China and local competitors in India. In addition, as in the United Kingdom, D&B's sales and marketing solutions landscape throughout Asia is localized and fragmented.

Alight. The markets for Alight's solutions are competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented. Its business faces competition from other global and national companies. The markets for Alight's solutions are subject to change as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, shifting client needs and increased competition from established and new competitors. We do not believe there is any single competitor with the breadth of Alight's solutions, and thus Alight's competitors vary for each of its solutions. Alight competes primarily on the basis of product and service quality, technology, breadth of offerings, ease of use and accessibility of technology, data protection, innovation, trust and reliability, price, and reputation.
Paysafe. The global payments industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing, highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Paysafe competes against a wide range of businesses, including businesses that are larger than it is, have a dominant and secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that Paysafe does not offer, as well as smaller companies that may be able to respond more quickly to regulatory and technological changes than Paysafe can. Paysafe competes against all forms of payments, including credit and debit cards; automated clearing house and bank transfers; other online payment services, local alternative payment methods, and digital wallets; mobile payments; cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technologies; and offline payment methods, including cash and check. Paysafe also competes against banks, merchant acquirers, and third-party payment processors. Paysafe competes primarily on the basis of brand recognition, distribution network and channel options, convenience, variety of payment methods, product and service offerings, customer service for both consumers and merchants, trust and reliability, speed, data protection and security, price and innovation.
Restaurant Group. The restaurant industry is highly competitive and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes. Competition for our restaurant brands varies by location. In general, our restaurant brands compete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. Restaurants are increasingly competing with grocery stores who are expanding their offerings of quick serve, ready-made meals and meal kits and with meal kit delivery services, which have increased market share in recent years. We expect to continue to compete in these areas.
Competitive Strengths
Proven management team.  Our Board and executive management team, led by Bill Foley, has a proven track record of identifying, acquiring, managing and operating businesses. In particular, Bill Foley has led the growth of several multi-billion dollar companies with hundreds of acquisitions across diverse platforms, including, FNF, FNIS, Black Knight, Ceridian, D&B and FG. Our Board and executive management's breadth of knowledge of operational matters and capital markets allows us to identify companies and strategic assets with attractive value propositions, to structure acquisitions to maximize the value acquired businesses, and to return the value created to our shareholders through long-term profitable operation of those businesses and, when appropriate, dispositions. We believe the Externalization under the Management Services Agreement enhances our executive management team’s ability to provide these services.
Intellectual Property
Dun & Bradstreet. D&B owns and controls various intellectual property rights, such as trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, service marks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and applications to the foregoing. These rights, in the aggregate, are of material importance to Dun & Bradstreet's business. D&B believes that the Dun & Bradstreet name and related tradenames, marks and logos are also of material importance to its business. Dun & Bradstreet is licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others, and other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by it. Dun & Bradstreet's trademarks, service marks, databases, software, copyrights, patents, patent applications and other intellectual property are proprietary and accordingly it relies on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, etc.) and contract and liability safeguards for protecting them throughout the world.
Dun & Bradstreet owns patents and patent applications both in the U.S. and in other selected countries. The patents and patent applications include claims, which pertain to certain technologies and inventions that D&B has determined are proprietary and warrant patent protection. The protection of its innovative technology and inventions, such as its proprietary methods for data curation and identity resolution, through the filing of patent applications, is part of Dun & Bradstreet's business strategy. Filing of patent applications may or may not provide Dun & Bradstreet with a dominant position in the fields of technology. However, these patents and/or patent applications may provide Dun & Bradstreet with legal defenses should subsequent patents in these fields be issued to third-parties and later asserted against it. Where appropriate, Dun & Bradstreet may also consider asserting or cross-licensing its patents.
Alight. Alight's intellectual property portfolio is comprised of various copyrights (including copyrights in software) and trademarks, as well as certain trade secrets or proprietary know-how of its business. Alight's success has resulted in part from its proprietary methodologies, process and other intellectual property, such as certain of its platforms. However, any of Alight's proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide significant competitive advantages.

Alight's business relies on software provided by both internal development and external sourcing to deliver its services. With respect to internally developed software, Alight claims copyright on all such software, registering works where appropriate. Alight requires all employees and contractors to assign to it the rights to works developed on Alight's behalf. In addition, Alight relies on maintaining source code confidentiality to maintain its market competitiveness. With respect to externally sourced software, Alight relies on contracts to allow for continued access for its business usage.
In the United States, trademark registrations may have a perpetual life, subject to continuous use and renewal every ten years, and may be subject to cancellation or invalidation based on certain use requirements and third-party challenges, or on other grounds. Alight vigorously enforces and protects its trademarks.
Paysafe. Paysafe relies upon a combination of copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, license agreements, confidentiality policies and procedures, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures designed to protect the intellectual property and commercially valuable confidential information and data used in its business in jurisdictions around the world. Paysafe seeks to protect its intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the United States and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. Paysafe also relies on contractual restrictions to protect its proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services. Paysafe has not applied for any patents in respect of its electronic payment processing systems and cannot give assurances that any patent applications will be made or that, if they are made, they will be granted. Additionally, it is possible that third parties, including its competitors, may obtain patents relating to technologies that overlap or compete with Paysafe's technology. If third parties obtain patent protection with respect to such technologies, they may assert that Paysafe's technology infringes their patents and seek to charge Paysafe a licensing fee or otherwise preclude Paysafe from using its technology.
Restaurant Group. We regard our Restaurant Group's service marks, including "O'Charley's", "Ninety Nine" and other service marks and trademarks as important factors in the marketing of our restaurants. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold our previously held "Legendary Baking" and "Village Inn" trademarks. We have also obtained trademarks for several of our brands' menu items and for various advertising slogans. We are aware of names and marks similar to our Restaurant Group's service marks and trademarks used by other persons in certain geographic areas where we have restaurants. However, we believe such uses will not adversely affect us. Our policy is to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks.
We license the use of our registered trademarks and service marks to franchisees and third parties through franchise arrangements and licenses. The franchise and license arrangements restrict franchisees' and licensees' activities with respect to the use of our trademarks and service marks, and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the trademarks and service marks.
Government Regulation
Paysafe. Laws and regulations in jurisdictions around the world apply to many key aspects of Paysafe's business. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions (including public fines), civil and criminal liability, public censures and constraints on Paysafe's ability to continue to operate, as well as potentially adverse effects on its brand and position with respect to competitors. It is also possible that current or future laws or regulations could be interpreted or applied in a manner that would prohibit, alter, or impair Paysafe's existing or planned products and services, or that could require costly, time-consuming, or otherwise burdensome compliance measures from Paysafe. The laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change.
Paysafe's payment networks are primarily subject to regulation in Europe under the Financial Conduct Authority and the Central Bank of Ireland and in the U.S. under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission Act and the U.S. Department of Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Paysafe has extensive internal regulatory compliance oversight functions which monitor compliance with the laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions in which Paysafe is licensed and in which they operate. 
Information Security
We and our unconsolidated affiliates are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information. Attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities. These attacks can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, consumer data and proprietary business information.
We and our unconsolidated affiliates remain focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect the clients and information systems of our operating subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates. This includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses on hardware, software, personnel and consulting services. As the primary products and

services of our operating subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates evolve, we apply a comprehensive approach to the mitigation of identified security risks. We have established risk management policies, including those related to information security and cybersecurity, designed to monitor and mitigate information security related risks.

Employees
As of December 31, 2022, Cannae and our consolidated subsidiaries had 11,988 employees, which includes 11,785 in our Restaurant Group and 203 in the various consolidated businesses comprising our Corporate and other segment.

Our Manager and Cannae LLC rely on the experience and expertise of a small number of highly qualified employees which make up our corporate management team. We continually assess our management team's capabilities and capacity with a view toward the long-term sustainability of the Company's operations.
Diversity
Diversity is a key component of our success, both at Cannae and within our portfolio companies. We stand committed to our philosophy that all employees deserve an inclusive workplace, one where each employee feels heard and empowered. We believe that the diversity of our employees and directors provides a variety of ideas and perspectives that allow us to achieve superior business results. Cannae and Cannae’s portfolio companies are committed to being equal opportunity employers and enhancing diversity and inclusion across our businesses. Cannae’s Code of Conduct & Ethics prohibits discrimination and harassment. Our nondiscrimination policy is distributed to all employees as part of our employee handbook, which employees must acknowledge annually. Our employees participate in annual programs including Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Training, and Reporting Harassment: Everyone’s Responsibility Training.
Board Diversity
In 2019, our board codified its commitment to diversity when selecting new director nominees, including candidates with a diversity of age, gender, nationality, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation by integrating this language into the director selection criteria in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. As of December 31, 2022, four out of eleven directors identify themselves as diverse.
Sustainability
We recognize that in our rapidly changing global economy, the management of Environmental, Social, & Governance (“ESG”) risks and opportunities is important for our long-term business success. Our Company and our board are committed to addressing ESG issues to better serve our employees, business partners, and the communities where we live and work. We aim to achieve superior financial performance for shareholders and maximize the value of our assets while mitigating risk, and we are committed to managing our business in an environmentally responsible, socially responsible, and ethical manner. 
To honor that commitment at the highest levels of the Company, our management team leads our ESG efforts. Our board of directors’ audit committee reviews these efforts.
Our ESG efforts are focused on:
Responsible Capital Deployment. ESG is embedded across our approach to the deployment of capital: from our due diligence in acquisition selection, to our value creation partnerships. We manage ESG issues with our portfolio companies which we believe helps us generate stronger returns for our shareholders while improving our impact on society. Dun & Bradstreet is committed to enhancing responsible business practices through automated solutions. Ceridian is focused on helping organizations enhance human capital management while supporting the communities where employees live and work through Ceridian Cares, an employee-driven charity. Alight is committed to helping companies care for their biggest asset – their people—by empowering workers and their families to make confident decisions around their health, wealth and wellbeing. The Restaurant Group is building inclusive workplaces while driving community outcomes in the areas where we operate. Our companies each have unique impacts, and we are working to further formalize and enhance the management of ESG across our entire portfolio of companies.
Preserving the Environment. We recognize the importance of conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner and integrating responsibly designed environmental management practices into our operations. We are continually seeking to improve our environmental management practices at our Las Vegas headquarters. From efforts to reduce water consumption and participating in recycling programs, we are working to reduce our environmental impact. 
Supporting Our Employees and Communities. We are dedicated to serving our employees and their families, building a diverse and inclusive workplace, and supporting our local communities. We value our talented workforces and the outstanding

contributions our employees make each day. We are dedicated to attracting, developing, and retaining talented teams through competitive compensation and benefits, and building a diverse and inclusive workplace. We believe in the importance of volunteerism and philanthropy to strengthen and engage local communities across our portfolio companies. Through local community involvement, corporate initiatives, and philanthropic giving – as well as an active community volunteer ethos – we work hard each day to support the communities we all live in. 
Operating Ethically. We are committed to strong governance systems and policies that are designed to ensure fair, transparent, and efficient business practices. Our reputation for integrity is one of our most important assets and each of our employees and directors is expected to contribute to the care and preservation of that asset. We operate in ways that we believe are fair, transparent, and compliant with all applicable regulations. We implement strong governance practices, policies, training, and reporting avenues to encourage and promote that all employees adhere to the highest standards for business integrity.
