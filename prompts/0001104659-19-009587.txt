ITEM 1.                        BUSINESS
GENERAL
 
Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively the General Partner), is a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT).  The General Partner controls Mack-Cali Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the Operating Partnership), as its sole general partner and owned an 89.8 percent and 89.6 percent common unit interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  The General Partners business is the ownership of interests in and operation of the Operating Partnership and all of the General Partners expenses are incurred for the benefit of the Operating Partnership.  The General Partner is reimbursed by the Operating Partnership for all expenses it incurs relating to the ownership and operation of the Operating Partnership.
 
The Operating Partnership conducts the business of providing leasing, management, acquisition, development, construction and tenant-related services for its General Partner.  The Operating Partnership, through its operating divisions and subsidiaries, including the Mack-Cali property-owning partnerships and limited liability companies, is the entity through which all of the General Partners operations are conducted.  Unless stated otherwise or the context requires, the Company refers to the General Partner and its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.
 
The Company owns and operates a real estate portfolio comprised predominantly of Class A office and office/flex properties located primarily in the Northeast with a recent emphasis on expansion into the multi-family rental sector in the same markets.  The Company performs substantially all real estate leasing, management, acquisition and development on an in-house basis.  Mack-Cali Realty Corporation was incorporated on May 24, 1994.  The Companys executive offices are located at Harborside 3, 210 Hudson Street, Suite 400, Jersey City, New Jersey 07311, and its telephone number is (732) 590-1010.  The Company has an internet website at www.mack-cali.com.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned or had interests in 135 properties, consisting of 56 office and 55 flex properties, totaling approximately 15.4 million square feet, leased to approximately 700 commercial tenants and 24 multi-family rental properties containing 6,910 residential units, plus developable land (collectively, the Properties).  The Properties are comprised of: (a) 120 wholly-owned or Company-controlled properties consisting of 52 office buildings and 52 flex buildings aggregating approximately 14.9  million square feet and 16 multi-family properties totaling 3,988 apartment units, (collectively, the Consolidated Properties); and (b) four office properties totaling approximately 0.5 million square feet, eight multi-family properties totaling 2,922 apartment units, two retail properties totaling 81,700 square feet and a 350-room hotel, which are owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has investment interests.  Unless otherwise indicated, all references to square feet represent net rentable area.  As of December 31, 2018, the Companys core, stabilized office and flex properties included in the Consolidated Properties were 83.2 percent leased.  Percentage leased includes all leases in effect as of the period end date, some of which have commencement dates in the future, and leases that expire at the period end date.  Leases that expired as of December 31, 2018 aggregate 10,108 square feet, or 0.1 percent of the net rentable square footage.  The Properties are located in six states, primarily in the Northeast, and the District of Columbia.  See Item 2: Properties.
 
The Companys historical strategy has been to focus its operations, acquisition and development of office properties in high-barrier-to-entry markets and sub-markets where it believes it is, or can become, a significant and preferred owner and operator.  In September 2015, the Company announced a strategic initiative to transform into a more concentrated owner of New Jersey Hudson River waterfront and transit-oriented office properties and a regional owner of luxury multi-family residential properties.  As part of this plan, over the past three years, the Company sold or has contracted to sell multiple properties, primarily commercial office, which it believes do not meet its long-term goals.
 
The Company believes that its Properties have excellent locations and access and are well-maintained and professionally managed.  As a result, the Company believes that its Properties attract high quality tenants and residents, and achieve high rental, occupancy and tenant retention rates within their markets.  The Company also believes that its extensive market knowledge provides it with a significant competitive advantage, which is further enhanced by its strong reputation for, and emphasis on, delivering highly responsive, professional management services.
 
BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 
Operations
 
Reputation: The Company has established a reputation as a highly-regarded landlord with an emphasis on delivering quality customer service in buildings it owns and/or manages.  The Company believes that its continued success depends in part on enhancing its reputation as an operator of choice, which will facilitate the retention of current tenants and residents and the attraction of new tenants
 
5




and residents.  The Company believes it provides a superior level of service to its customers that is an important factor in working to achieve positive leasing results as well as improving tenant retention.
 
Communication with tenants: The Company emphasizes frequent communication with its customers to ensure first-class service to the Properties.  Property management personnel generally are located on site at the Properties to provide convenient access to management and to ensure that the Properties are well-maintained.  Property managements primary responsibility is to ensure that buildings are operated at peak efficiency in order to meet both the Companys and tenants needs and expectations.  Property management personnel additionally budget and oversee capital improvements and building system upgrades to enhance the Properties competitive advantages in their respective markets and to maintain the quality of the Properties.
 
The Companys in-house leasing representatives for its office portfolio develop and maintain long-term relationships with the Companys diverse tenant base and coordinate leasing, expansion, relocation and build-to-suit opportunities.  This approach allows the Company to offer office space in the appropriate size and location to current or prospective tenants in any of its sub-markets.
 
The Companys in-house multi-family rental management team emphasizes meticulous attention to detail and an unwavering commitment to customer service to complement the quality, design excellence and luxury living attributes of its multi-family rental properties.  The Company believes this strategy will enable the Company to buttress managements reputation with the market-leading designs, amenities and features of its multi-family rental properties to attract quality residents.
 
Portfolio Management: The Company plans to continue to own and operate a portfolio of office and office/flex properties in high-barrier-to-entry markets, with a primary focus in the Northeast.  The Company also expects to continue to complement its core portfolio of office and office/flex properties by pursuing acquisition and development opportunities in the multi-family rental sector. The Companys primary objectives are to maximize operating cash flow and to enhance the value of its portfolio through effective management, acquisition, development and property sales strategies.
 
The Company seeks to maximize the value of its existing office and office/flex portfolio through implementing operating strategies designed to produce the highest effective rental and occupancy rates and lowest tenant installation costs within the markets that it operates, and further within the parameters of those markets.  The Company continues to pursue internal growth through leasing vacant space, re-leasing space at the highest possible effective rents in light of current market conditions with contractual rent increases and developing or redeveloping office space for its diverse base of high credit quality tenants, including Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd; KPMG, LLP; and TD Ameritrade Services Company.  In addition, the Company seeks economies of scale through volume discounts to take advantage of its size and dominance in particular sub-markets, and operating efficiencies through the use of in-house management, leasing, marketing, financing, accounting, legal and development.
 
The Company continually reviews its portfolio and opportunities to divest office and office/flex properties that, among other things, no longer meet its long-term strategy, have reached their potential, are less efficient to operate or can be sold at attractive prices when market conditions are favorable.  The Company anticipates continuing to redeploy the proceeds from sales of office and office/flex properties to develop, redevelop and acquire multi-family rental properties, as well as reposition certain office properties into multi-family/mixed use properties, in its core Northeast sub-markets as part of its overall strategy to reposition its portfolio from office and office/flex to a mix of office, office/flex and multi-family rental properties.
 
The Company believes that the opportunity to invest in multi-family development properties at higher returns on cost will position the Company to potentially produce higher levels of net operating income than if the Company were to only purchase stabilized multi-family properties at market returns.  The Company believes that the transition to a company with a greater proportion of its properties in the multi-family residential sector will ultimately result in the creation of greater shareholder value than remaining a primarily suburban commercial office company, in part due to the lower capitalization rates associated with the multi-family sector.
 
Acquisitions: The Company also believes that growth opportunities exist through acquiring operating properties or properties for redevelopment with attractive returns in its core Northeast sub-markets where, based on its expertise in leasing, managing and operating properties, it believes it is, or can become, a significant and preferred owner and operator.  The Company intends either directly or through joint ventures to acquire, invest in or redevelop additional properties, that: (i) are expected to provide attractive long-term yields; (ii) are well-located, of high quality and competitive in their respective sub-markets; (iii) are located in its existing sub-markets or in sub-markets in which the Company is or can become a significant and preferred owner and operator; and (iv) it believes have been under-managed or are otherwise capable of improved performance through intensive management, capital improvements and/or leasing that should result in increased effective rental and occupancy rates.
 
The Company has entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures (including limited liability companies and partnerships) through which it would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 percent of a property owned directly by such
 
6




joint ventures, and may include joint ventures that the Company does not control or manage, especially in connection with its expansion into the multi-family rental sector. The decision to pursue property acquisitions either directly or through joint ventures is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by a seller or co-developer of a property; (ii) the Companys desire to diversify its portfolio by expanding into the multi-family rental sector and achieve a blended portfolio of office and multi-family rental properties by market and sub-market; (iii) the Companys goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet; and (iv) the Companys expectation that, in some circumstances, it will be able to achieve higher returns on its invested capital or reduce its risk if a joint venture vehicle is used.  Investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of the Companys assets.  Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and the Companys ability to operate and/or dispose of its interests in a joint venture in its sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement.  Many of the Companys joint venture agreements entitle it to receive leasing, management, development and similar fees and/or a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met.  See Note 4: Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  to the Companys Financial Statements.
 
Development: The Company seeks to selectively develop additional properties either directly or through joint ventures where it believes such development will result in a favorable risk-adjusted return on investment in coordination with the above operating strategies.  The Company identifies development opportunities primarily through its local market presence.  Such development primarily will occur:  (i) in stable core Northeast sub-markets where the demand for such space exceeds available supply; and (ii) where the Company is, or can become, a significant and preferred owner and operator.  As part of the Companys strategy to expand its multi-family rental portfolio, the Company may consider development opportunities with respect to improved land with existing commercial uses and seek to rezone the sites for multi-family rental use and development.  As a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development, the Company may be required to hold land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements or rezoning is obtained.  The Company also may undertake repositioning opportunities that may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital.
Property Sales: While managements principal intention is to own and operate its properties on a long-term basis, it periodically assesses the attributes of each of its properties, with a particular focus on the supply and demand fundamentals of the sub-markets in which they are located.  The Company continually reviews its portfolio and opportunities to divest properties that, among other things, no longer meet its long-term strategy, have reached their potential, are less efficient to operate, or can be sold at attractive prices when market conditions are favorable.  Consistent with its strategic initiative announced in 2015, the Company completed the sale of rental property for aggregate gross sales proceeds of $385.1 million during 2018 and $415.6 million during 2017.
Financial
 
The Company currently intends to maintain a ratio of debt-to-undepreciated assets (total debt of the Company as a percentage of total undepreciated assets) of 50 percent or less, however there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in maintaining this ratio.  As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Companys total debt constituted approximately 45 percent and 47 percent of total undepreciated assets of the Company, respectively.  The decrease in this ratio in 2018 was primarily the result of using proceeds from property sales to repay outstanding debt during the year.  Although there is no limit in the Companys organizational documents on the amount of indebtedness that the Company may incur, the Company has entered into certain financial agreements which contain covenants that limit the Companys ability to incur indebtedness under certain circumstances.  The Company intends to utilize the most appropriate sources of capital for future acquisitions, development, capital improvements and other investments, which may include funds from operating activities, proceeds from property and land sales, joint venture capital, and short-term and long-term borrowings (including draws on the Companys unsecured revolving credit facility), and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 352 full-time employees.
 
COMPETITION
 
The leasing of real estate is highly competitive.  The Properties compete for tenants and residents with lessors and developers of similar properties located in their respective markets primarily on the basis of location, the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), services or amenities provided, the design and condition of the Properties, and reputation as an owner and operator of quality properties in the relevant markets.  Additionally, the number of competitive multi-family rental properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the Companys ability to lease residential units and on rents charged.  In addition, other forms of multi-family rental properties or single family housing provide alternatives to potential residents of multi-family properties.  The Company competes with other entities, some of which may have significant resources or who may be willing to accept lower returns or pay higher prices than the Company in terms of acquisition and development opportunities.  The Company also experiences competition when attempting to acquire or dispose of real estate, including competition from domestic and foreign financial institutions, other REITs, life insurance companies, pension trusts, trust funds, partnerships, individual investors and others.

REGULATIONS
 
Many laws and governmental regulations apply to the ownership and/or operation of the Properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently.
 
Under various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health, an owner of real estate may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in the property.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was responsible for, or even knew of, the presence of such substances.  The presence of such substances may adversely affect the owners ability to rent or sell the property or to borrow using such property as collateral and may expose it to liability resulting from any release of, or exposure to, such substances.  Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at another location may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person.  Certain environmental laws impose liability for the release of asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances.
 
In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and development of real properties, the Company may be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs, including governmental penalties and injuries to persons and property.
 
There can be no assurance that (i) future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability, (ii) the current environmental condition of the Properties will not be affected by tenants, by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the Properties (such as the presence of underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to the Company, or (iii) the Companys assessments reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are no material environmental liabilities of which the Company is aware.  If compliance with the various laws and regulations, now existing or hereafter adopted, exceeds the Companys budgets for such items, the Companys ability to make expected distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected.
 
There are no other laws or regulations which have a material effect on the Companys operations, other than typical federal, state and local laws affecting the development and operation of real property, such as zoning laws.
 
INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
 
The Company operates in two industry segments: (i) commercial and other real estate and (ii) multi-family real estate and services.

Please see our financial statements attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein for financial information relating to our industry segments.
SIGNIFICANT TENANTS
 
As of December 31, 2018, no tenant accounted for more than 10 percent of the Companys consolidated revenues.

In November 2018, the Company announced that the employment of Robert Andrew Marshall as President and Executive Vice President of Development of Roseland Residential Trust (RRT) was terminated effective as of October 31, 2018.  In addition, the Company also restructured certain other corporate and property management personnel during the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Acquisitions
 
On February 6, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of a 271,988 square foot office property located in Iselin, New Jersey, for a purchase price of $61.5 million, which was funded using funds available with the Companys qualified intermediary and borrowings under the Companys unsecured revolving credit facility.
 
On January 25, 2019, the Company signed an agreement to acquire a 377-unit multi-family rental property located in Jersey City, New Jersey for approximately $264 million, subject to certain conditions.  The acquisition is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2019.
 
Consolidations
 
On August 2, 2018, the Company, which held a 24.27 percent subordinated interest in the unconsolidated joint venture, Marbella Tower Urban Renewal Associates LLC, a 412-unit multi-family operating property located in Jersey City, New Jersey, acquired its equity partners 50 percent interest for $65.6 million in cash.  The property was subject to a mortgage loan that had a principal balance of $95 million.  The cash portion of the acquisition was funded primarily through borrowings under the Companys unsecured revolving credit facility.  Concurrently with the closing, the joint venture repaid the $95 million mortgage loan in full and obtained a new loan collateralized by the property in the amount of $131 million, which bears interest at 4.07 percent and matures in August 2026.  The venture distributed $37.4 million of the loan proceeds, of which the Companys share was $30.4 million.  As a result of the acquisition, the Company increased its ownership of the property from a 24.27 percent subordinated interest to a 74.27 percent controlling interest.  In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810, Consolidation, the Company evaluated the acquisition and determined that the entity meets the criteria of a variable interest entity (VIE).  As such, the Company consolidated the asset upon acquisition and accordingly, remeasured its equity interests, as required by the FASBs consolidation guidance, at fair value (based upon the income approach using current rates and market cap rates and discount rates).  As a result, the Company recorded a gain on change of control of interests of $14.2 million (a non-cash item) in the year ended December 31, 2018, when the Company accounted for the transaction as a VIE that is not a business in accordance with ASC 810-10-30-4.  Additional non-cash items included in the acquisition were the Companys carrying value of its interest in the joint venture of $14 million and the noncontrolling interests fair value of $29.8 million.
Properties Commencing Initial Operations
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, four multi-family rental properties and a hotel with a total of 1,317 apartment units and rooms commenced initial operations for total development costs of approximately $458 million.
Dispositions
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company disposed of 30 office properties and a developable land property in New Jersey and New York for net sales proceeds of approximately $370.0 million, with net gains of approximately $150.5 million from the dispositions.
 
The Company identified as held for sale six office properties and a multi-family rental property as of December 31, 2018.  The total estimated sales proceeds, net of expected selling costs, from the sales are expected to be approximately $124 million.  The Company determined that the carrying value of four of the properties was not expected to be recovered from estimated net sales proceeds and accordingly recognized an unrealized loss allowance of $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Land Impairments
 
The Company owns two separate developable land parcels in Conshohocken and Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, that were being considered for development into multi-family rental properties.  During the fourth quarter 2018, the Company made the decision to pursue selling the land parcels rather than developing them.  Due to the shortening of the expected periods of ownership, the Company determined that it was necessary to reduce the carrying values of the land parcels to their estimated fair values (ascertained by broker opinions of value obtained during the marketing process) and recorded total land impairments charges of $24.6 million at December 31, 2018.
Joint Venture Activity
 
On January 31, 2019, the Company, which held a 24.27 percent subordinated interest in the unconsolidated joint venture, Marbella Tower Urban Renewal Associates South LLC, a 311-unit multi-family operating property located in Jersey City, New Jersey, acquired
 
9




its equity partners 50 percent interest for $77.5 million in cash.  The acquisition was funded primarily using available cash.  Concurrently with the closing, the joint venture repaid in full the propertys $74.7 million mortgage loan and obtained a new loan in the amount of $117 million.
 
On December 11, 2018, the Company acquired one of its partners interest in the unconsolidated joint venture that owns the Metropolitan and Shops at 40 Park and the Lofts at 40 Park for $1.3 million.  As a result, the Company increased its ownership from 12.5 percent interest to 25 percent interest in the Metropolitan and Shops at 40 Park and from 25 percent interest to 50 percent interest in the Lofts at 40 Park.
 
Development Activity
 
In 2015, the Company entered into a 90-percent owned joint venture with XS Port Imperial Hotel, LLC to form XS Hotel Urban Renewal Associates LLC, which is developing a 372-key hotel (164 keys Residence Inn and 208 keys Marriott Envue) in Weehawken, New Jersey.  The Residence Inn opened in 4Q 2018 and the Marriott Envue is expected to open in 2Q 2019.   The construction of the project is estimated to cost $159.9 million, with construction costs of $147.1 million incurred by the venture through December 31, 2018.  The project costs are expected to be funded from a $94 million construction loan (with $73.4 million outstanding as of December 31, 2018).
 
The Company is developing a 313-unit multi-family project known as Building 8/9 at Port Imperial in Weehawken, New Jersey, which began construction in third quarter 2018.  The construction project, which is estimated to cost $142.6 million, of which construction costs of $35.4 million have been incurred through December 31, 2018, is expected to be ready for occupancy in fourth quarter 2020.  The Company is expected to fund $50.6 million of the construction costs, of which the Company has funded $35.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and the remaining construction costs are expected to be funded primarily from a $92 million construction loan.
 
The Company is developing a 326-unit multi-family project known as Chase III at Overlook Ridge, in Malden, Massachusetts, which began construction in third quarter 2018.  The construction project, which is estimated to cost $99.9 million of which $20.2 million have been incurred through December 31, 2018, is expected to be ready for occupancy in fourth quarter 2020.  The Company is expected to fund $37.9 million of construction costs, of which the Company has funded $20.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and the remaining construction costs are expected to be funded primarily from a $62 million construction loan.
 
Operations
 
Of the Companys core office markets, most continue to show signs of rental rate improvement while the leased percentage has declined or stabilized.  The percentage leased in the Companys consolidated portfolio of stabilized core operating commercial properties was 83.2 percent at December 31, 2018, as compared to 87.6 percent at December 31, 2017 and 90.6 percent at December 31, 2016 (after adjusting for properties identified as non-core at the time).  Percentage leased includes all leases in effect as of the period end date, some of which have commencement dates in the future and leases that expire at the period end date.  Leases that expired as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 aggregate 10,108, 343,217 and 151,655 square feet, respectively, or 0.1, 2.3 and 0.7 percentage of the net rentable square footage, respectively.  With the positive rental rate results the Company has achieved in most of its markets recently, the Company believes that rental rates on new leases will generally be, on average, not lower than rates currently being paid.  If these recent leasing results do not prove to be sustaining during 2019, the Company may receive less revenue from the same space.
FINANCING ACTIVITY
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company obtained new mortgage debt aggregating approximately $328 million, collateralized by 3 properties, with effective interest rates ranging from 4.17 percent to 4.56 percent.  On August 2, 2018, the Company obtained $131 million of mortgage debt in connection with the Companys acquisition and consolidation of its joint venture partners majority ownership interest in Marbella.  On December 7, 2018, the Company retired $70 million of construction debt associated with the Portside 5/6 development project, replacing it with a $97 million permanent mortgage. On December 17, 2018, the Company retired $70.1 million of construction debt associated with the River House 11 development project, replacing it with a $100 million permanent mortgage. On January 8, 2018, the Company prepaid mortgage debt of approximately $209 million that encumbered the Companys property at Harborside Plaza 5, for which it incurred costs of approximately $8.4 million.

 ·                  the value of our real estate assets, which may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or obtain or maintain debt financing secured by our properties or on an unsecured basis;
 ·                  the extent of any tenant bankruptcies or of any early lease terminations;
 ·                  our ability to lease or re-lease space at current or anticipated rents;
 ·                  changes in the supply of and demand for our properties;
 ·                  changes in interest rate levels and volatility in the securities markets;
 ·                  our ability to complete construction and development activities on time and within budget, including without limitation obtaining regulatory permits and the availability and cost of materials, labor and equipment;
 ·                  forward-looking financial and operational information, including information relating to future development projects, potential acquisitions or dispositions, leasing activities, capitalization rates, and projected revenue and income;
 ·                  changes in operating costs;
 ·                  our ability to obtain adequate insurance, including coverage for terrorist acts;
 ·                  our credit worthiness and the availability of financing on attractive terms or at all, which may adversely impact our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt and our future interest expense;
 ·                  changes in governmental regulation, tax rates and similar matters; and
 ·                  other risks associated with the development and acquisition of properties, including risks that the development may not be completed on schedule, that the tenants or residents will not take occupancy or pay rent, or that development or operating costs may be greater than anticipated.
