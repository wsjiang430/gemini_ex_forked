Item 1.     Business
Description of Business

Denny’s Corporation (Denny’s), a Delaware corporation, is one of America’s largest franchised full-service restaurant chains based on the number of restaurants. Denny’s, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Denny’s, Inc., owns and operates the Denny’s brand. At December 26, 2018, the Denny’s brand consisted of 1,709 franchised, licensed and company operated restaurants around the world with combined sales of $2.9 billion, including 1,578 restaurants in the United States and 131 international locations. As of December 26, 2018, 1,536 of our restaurants were franchised or licensed, representing 90% of the total restaurants, and 173 were company operated.
Denny’s is known as America’s Diner, or in the case of our international locations, “the local diner.” Open 24/7 in most locations, we provide our guests quality food that emphasizes everyday value and new products through our compelling limited time only offerings, delivered in a warm, friendly “come as you are” atmosphere. Denny’s has been serving guests for 65 years and is best known for its breakfast fare, which is available around the clock. The Build Your Own Grand Slam, one of our most popular menu items, traces its origin back to the Original Grand Slam which was first introduced in 1977. In addition to our breakfast-all-day items, Denny’s offers a wide selection of lunch and dinner items including burgers, sandwiches, salads and skillet entrées, along with an assortment of beverages, appetizers and desserts.
In 2018, Denny’s average annual restaurant sales were $2.3 million for company restaurants and $1.6 million for domestic franchised restaurants. At our company restaurants, the guest check average was $10.38 with an approximate average of 4,300 guests served per week. Because our restaurants are open 24 hours, we have four dayparts (breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night), accounting for 26%, 35%, 21% and 18%, respectively, of average daily sales at company restaurants. Due to the launch of Denny’s On Demand in May 2017, average off-premise sales across all dayparts grew from 6.6% of total sales in December 2016 to 11.7% of total sales in December 2018. Weekends have traditionally been the most popular time for guests to visit our restaurants. In 2018, 36% of an average week of sales at company restaurants occurred from Friday late night through Sunday lunch.
References to “Denny’s,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in this Form 10-K are references to Denny’s Corporation and its subsidiaries. Financial information about our operations, including our revenues and net income for the fiscal years ended
December 26, 2018, December 27, 2017, and December 28, 2016, and our total assets as of December 26, 2018 and December 27, 2017, is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Restaurant Development 
Franchising 

Our criteria to become a Denny’s franchisee include minimum liquidity and net worth requirements and appropriate operational experience. We believe that Denny’s is an attractive financial proposition for current and potential franchisees and that our fee structure is competitive with other full-service brands. Traditional twenty-year Denny’s franchise agreements have an initial fee of up to $30,000 and a royalty payment of up to 4.5% of gross sales. Additionally, our franchisees are required to contribute up to 3.25% of gross sales for marketing and may make additional advertising contributions as part of a local marketing co-operative. Franchise agreements for nontraditional locations, such as university campuses, may contain higher royalty and lower advertising contribution rates than the traditional franchise agreements. Our domestic royalty rate averaged approximately 4.17% during 2018.
We work closely with our franchisees to plan and execute many aspects of the business. The Denny’s Franchisee Association (“DFA”) was created to promote communication among our franchisees and between the Company and our franchise community. DFA board members and Company management primarily work together through Brand Advisory Councils relating to Development, Marketing, Operations and Technology matters, as well as through a Supply Chain Oversight Committee for procurement and distribution matters.

 Site Selection
The success of any restaurant is significantly influenced by its location. Our development team works closely with franchisees and real estate brokers to identify sites which meet specific standards. Sites are evaluated on the basis of a variety of factors, including but not limited to:

• | demographics;


• | traffic patterns;


• | visibility;


• | building constraints;


• | competition;


• | environmental restrictions; and


• | proximity to high-traffic consumer activities.

Domestic Development

To accelerate the growth of the brand in specific under-penetrated markets, we offer certain incentive programs. These programs provide significant incentives for franchisees to develop locations in areas where Denny’s does not have the top market share. The benefits to franchisees include reduced franchise fees, lower royalties for a limited time period and credits towards certain development services, such as training fees.
In addition to these incentive programs, we plan to increase our domestic development pipeline by approximately 40 to 70 restaurants through our recently announced refranchising and development strategy. These commitments will be attached to the sale of between 90 and 125 company operated restaurants which we expect to complete over the next 12 to 15 months. While we anticipate the majority of the restaurants to be opened under these agreements, generally as scheduled, from time to time some of our franchisees’ ability to grow and meet their development commitments may be hampered by the economy, the lending environment or other circumstances.
International Development 

In addition to the development agreements signed for domestic restaurants, as of December 26, 2018, we had the potential to develop over 85 international franchised restaurants with our current development partners in various countries including Aruba, Canada, Central America, Mexico, the Philippines and the United Kingdom. These development commitments include our recently announced enhanced development agreements with Canada and the Philippines. The majority of these restaurants are expected to open over the next ten years. During 2018, we opened nine international franchised locations, including three in Canada, two in the Philippines and one each in Honduras, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom.
During 2019, we expect to open a total of 35 to 45 restaurants in domestic and international markets, resulting in approximately flat net restaurant growth.

Franchise Focused Business Model
Through our development and refranchising efforts we have achieved a restaurant portfolio mix of 90% franchised and 10% company operated. The majority of our future restaurant openings and growth of the brand will come primarily from the development of franchised restaurants. The following table summarizes the changes in the number of company restaurants and franchised and licensed restaurants during the past five years (excluding relocations):

Restaurant Operations

We believe that the consistent and reliable execution of basic restaurant operations in each Denny’s restaurant, whether it is company or franchised, is critical to our success. To meet and exceed our guests’ expectations, we require both our company and our franchised restaurants to maintain the same strict brand standards. These standards relate to the preparation and efficient serving of quality food and the maintenance, repair and cleanliness of each restaurant.
We devote significant effort to ensuring all restaurants offer quality food served by friendly, knowledgeable and attentive employees in a clean and well-maintained restaurant. We seek to ensure that our company restaurants meet our high standards through a network of Directors of Company Operations, Company District Managers and restaurant level managers, all of whom spend the majority of their time in the restaurants. A network of Regional Directors of Franchise Operations and Franchise Business Coaches provide oversight of our franchised restaurants to ensure compliance with brand standards, promote operational excellence and provide general support to our franchisees. 
A principal feature of our restaurant operations is the consistent focus on improving operations at the restaurant level. Our Pride Review Program, executed by the Franchise Business Coaches and District Managers, is designed to continuously improve the execution of our brand standards and shift management at each company and franchised restaurant. In addition, Denny’s maintains training programs for hourly employees and restaurant management. Hourly employee training programs (including online learning) are position-specific and focus on skills and tasks necessary to successfully fulfill the responsibilities assigned to them, while continually enhancing guest satisfaction. Denny’s Manager In Training (“MIT”) program provides managers with the knowledge and leadership skills needed to successfully operate a Denny’s restaurant. The MIT program is required for all new managers of company restaurants and is also available to Denny’s franchisees to train their managers.

Product Development and Marketing
Menu Offerings
The Denny’s menu offers a large selection of high-quality, reasonably priced products designed to appeal to all types of guests. We offer a wide variety of entrées for breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night dining, in addition to appetizers, desserts and beverages. Most Denny’s restaurants offer special items for children and seniors at reduced prices. Our “America’s Diner” brand positioning, which provides the promise of Everyday Value with craveable, indulgent products served in a friendly and welcoming atmosphere, establishes the framework for our primary marketing strategies. These strategies focus on optimizing our product offering to further align with consumer needs, which includes enhancing our core “breakfast all day” platform while providing everyday affordability, primarily through our $2 $4 $6 $8 Value Menu® and delivering compelling core menu and limited-time-only products. 
Product Development

Denny’s is a consumer-driven brand focusing on hospitality, menu choices and the overall guest experience. Our Product Development team works closely with consumer insights obtained through primary and secondary qualitative and quantitative studies. Input and ideas from our franchisees, vendors and operators are also integrated into this process. These insights form the strategic foundation for menu architecture, pricing, promotion and advertising. Before a new menu item can be brought to market, it is rigorously tested against consumer expectations, standards of culinary discipline, food science and technology, nutritional analysis, financial benefit and operational execution. This testing process ensures that new menu items are not only appealing, competitive, profitable and marketable, but can be prepared and delivered with excellence in our restaurants.
The added value of these insights and strategic understandings also assists our Restaurant Operations and Information Technology staff in the evaluation and development of new restaurant processes and upgraded restaurant equipment that may enhance our speed of service, food quality and order accuracy.

We continually evolve our menu through new additions, deletions or improvements to meet the needs of a changing consumer and market place.
Product Sources and Availability

Our Purchasing department administers programs for the procurement of food and non-food products. Our franchisees also purchase food and non-food products directly from our vendors under these programs. Our centralized purchasing program is designed to ensure uniform product quality as well as to minimize food, beverage and supply costs. The size of our brand provides significant purchasing power, which often enables us to obtain products at favorable prices from nationally recognized suppliers.

While our Purchasing department negotiates contracts for nearly all products used in our restaurants, the majority of such products are purchased and distributed through McLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”) under a long-term distribution contract. McLane distributes restaurant products and supplies to the Denny’s system from approximately 200 vendors, representing approximately 90% of our restaurant product and supply purchases. We believe that satisfactory alternative sources of supplies are generally available for all of the items regularly used by our restaurants. We have not experienced any material shortages of food, equipment, or other products which are necessary to our restaurant operations.
Marketing and Advertising

Our Marketing team employs integrated marketing and advertising strategies that promote the Denny’s brand. Brand and communications strategy, advertising, brand engagement, broadcast media, social media, digital media, menu management, product innovation and development, consumer insights, multicultural marketing, public relations, reputation management, customer relationship management, field marketing and national/local promotions and partnerships all fall under the marketing umbrella.

We focus our marketing campaigns on amplifying Denny’s brand strengths as America’s Diner, promoting the various breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night menu offerings in addition to both value and premium limited time only offerings, and promoting the convenience of online ordering and payment for pick-up or delivery. Denny’s deploys comprehensive marketing strategies on a national level and through local co-operatives, targeting customers through network, cable and local television, radio, online, digital, social, outdoor and print media.

Information Technology
The mission of our Information Technology department is to align our technology strategy in support of our business strategies. We focus on leveraging technology to drive efficiencies, simplify and standardize operations, and streamline the guest experience. We also deliver solutions that support financial and regulatory needs in addition to necessary business improvements. 
We rely on information technology systems in all aspects of our operations. At the restaurant level, systems include point-of-sale platforms along with systems and tools for kitchen operations, labor scheduling, inventory management, cash management and credit card transaction processing. Our technology platform includes industry-standard market solutions as well as proprietary software and integration yielding tools and information managers need to run efficient and effective restaurants. We invest in new technologies and R&D efforts to improve operations and enhance the guest experience through innovative solutions like online ordering and payment for pick-up and delivery.
At the corporate level, we have a robust Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform that supports finance, accounting, human resources and payroll functions. Our ERP is a cloud-based market solution, enabling us to take advantage of continual software improvements aligned with industry best practices. We also have systems that consolidate and report on data from our franchised and company restaurants, including transaction-level detail. In 2018, we continued to invest in technology to improve reporting and analytics as well as to optimize business processes. These systems are collectively supported by an enterprise network that facilitates seamless connectivity for applications and data throughout our business infrastructure. 
Our information technology systems have been designed to protect against unauthorized access and data loss. We are continuously focused on enhancing our cybersecurity capabilities. We are required to maintain the highest level of Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) compliance and protect critical and sensitive data for our employees, customers, and the Company. These standards are set by a consortium of major credit card companies and require certain levels of system security and procedures to protect our customers’ credit card and other personal information. We have deployed payment technologies that are EMV (Europay, Mastercard, Visa) certified, and we employ point-to-point encryption to ensure no credit card data is stored within our restaurants. Further, we monitor franchisees’ compliance with PCI standards.  
See “Risk Factors” for further information regarding Information Technology. 
Brand Protection, Quality & Regulatory Compliance
Denny’s will only serve our guests food that is safe, wholesome and meets our quality standards. Our systems, from “farm to fork,” are based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (“HACCP”), whereby we prevent, eliminate or reduce hazards to a safe level to protect the health of our employees and guests. To ensure this basic expectation of our guests, Denny’s also has risk-based systems in place to validate only approved vendors and distributors which meet and follow our product specifications and food handling procedures. Vendors, distributors and restaurant employees follow regulatory requirements (federal, state and local), industry “best practices” and Denny’s Brand Standards.
The Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (referred to as the Preventive Controls for Human Food Regulation) is intended to ensure safe manufacturing/processing, packing and holding of food products for human consumption in the United States. The regulation requires that certain activities must be completed by a “preventive controls qualified individual” who has “successfully completed training in the development and application of risk-based preventive controls.” Our Chief Food Safety Officer and our Food Safety and Quality Assurance teams have all been certified.
We use multiple approaches to ensure food safety and quality generally including quarterly third-party unannounced restaurant inspections (utilizing Denny’s Brand Protection Reviews), health department reviews, guest complaints and employee/manager training in their respective roles. It is a brand standard that all regulatory reviews/inspections be submitted to the Brand Protection, Quality & Regulatory Compliance department within 24 hours. We follow-up on all inspections received and assist operations personnel, facilities personnel and franchisees, where applicable, to bring resolution to regulatory issues or concerns. If operational brand standard expectations are not met, a remediation process is immediately initiated. Our Food Safety/HACCP program uses nationally recognized food safety training courses and American National Standards Institute accredited certification programs. 
5

All Denny’s restaurants are required to have a person certified in food protection on duty for all hours of operation. Our Food Safety/HACCP program has been recognized nationally by regulatory departments, the restaurant industry and our peers. We continuously work toward improving our processes and procedures. We are advocates for the advancement of food safety within the industry’s organizations, such as the National Council of Chain Restaurants (“NCCR”), NCCR Food Safety Task Force, the National Restaurant Association (“NRA”) (member of the Steering Committee for the October 2018 - October 2020 term) and the NRA’s Quality Assurance Executive Study Group.
Seasonality

Restaurant sales are generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth calendar quarters (October through March). Additionally, severe weather, storms and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions.
Trademarks and Service Marks

Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we have certain trademarks and service marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in international jurisdictions, including “Denny’s®,” “Grand Slam®,” and “$2 $4 $6 $8 Value Menu®.” We consider our trademarks and service marks important to the identification of our restaurants and believe they are of material importance to the conduct of our business. In addition, we have registered various domain names on the internet that incorporate certain of our trademarks and service marks. We believe these domain name registrations are an integral part of our identity. From time to time, we may resort to legal measures to defend and protect the use of our intellectual property. Generally, with appropriate renewal and use, the registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely.
Competition

The restaurant industry is highly competitive. Restaurants compete on the basis of name recognition and advertising; the price, quality, variety and perceived value of their food offerings; the quality and speed of their guest service; the location and attractiveness of their facilities; and the convenience of to-go ordering and delivery options.

Denny’s direct competition in the full-service category includes a collection of national and regional chains, as well as thousands of independent operators. We also compete with quick service restaurants as they attempt to upgrade their menus with premium sandwiches, entrée salads, new breakfast offerings and extended hours.

We believe that Denny’s has a number of competitive strengths, including strong brand recognition, well-located restaurants and market penetration. We benefit from economies of scale in a variety of areas, including advertising, purchasing and distribution. Additionally, we believe that Denny’s has competitive strengths in the value, variety and quality of our food products, and in the quality and training of our employees. See “Risk Factors” for additional factors relating to our competition in the restaurant industry.

Economic, Market and Other Conditions

The restaurant industry is affected by many factors, including changes in national, regional and local economic conditions affecting consumer spending; the political environment (including acts of war and terrorism); changes in customer travel patterns including changes in the price of gasoline; changes in socio-demographic characteristics of areas where restaurants are located; changes in consumer tastes and preferences; food safety and health concerns; outbreaks of flu viruses (such as avian flu) or other diseases; increases in the number of restaurants; and unfavorable trends affecting restaurant operations, such as rising wage rates, health care costs, utilities expenses and unfavorable weather. See “Risk Factors” for additional information.
Government Regulations

We and our franchisees are subject to local, state, federal and international laws and regulations governing various aspects of the restaurant business, such as compliance with various minimum wage, overtime, health care, food safety, citizenship, and fair labor standards. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and international laws governing franchise sales and the franchise relationship.
6

We believe we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot predict the effect on operations of the enactment of additional regulations in the future.
See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks related to governmental regulation of our business.
