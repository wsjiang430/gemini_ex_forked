 Overview
     Our Company
     We are a women’s healthcare company focused on creating and commercializing innovative products to support the lifespan of women and championing awareness of women’s healthcare issues, specifically, for pregnancy prevention, pregnancy, childbirth, nursing, pre-menopause, and menopause. At TherapeuticsMD, we combine entrepreneurial spirit, clinical expertise, and business leadership to develop and commercialize health solutions that enable new standards of care for women. Our solutions range from advanced hormone therapy pharmaceutical products to patient-controlled, long-acting contraceptive. We also manufacture and distribute branded and generic prescription prenatal vitamins under the vitaMedMD® and BocaGreenMD® brands.
     With our SYMBODA™ technology, we are developing and commercializing advanced hormone therapy pharmaceutical products to enable delivery of bio-identical hormones through a variety of dosage forms and administration routes. Our track record of commercialization allows us to efficiently leverage and grow our marketing and sales organization to commercialize our recently approved products.
     During 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval of our drugs has transitioned our company from predominately focused on conducting research and development to one focused on commercializing our drugs. In July 2018, we launched our recently FDA approved product, IMVEXXY® (estradiol vaginal inserts) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe dyspareunia (vaginal pain associated with sexual activity), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, or VVA, due to menopause. We are also focused on commercialization activities necessary for launch of BIJUVA™ and ANNOVERA™. BIJUVA™ is our hormone therapy combination of bio-identical 17ß-estradiol and bio-identical progesterone in a single, oral softgel capsule, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms, or VMS, due to menopause in women with a uterus, which was approved by the FDA on October 28, 2018. ANNOVERA™ (segesterone acetate/ethinyl estradiol vaginal system), is the first and only patient-controlled, procedure-free, reversible prescription contraceptive that can prevent unintended pregnancy for up to a full year, which was approved by the FDA on August 10, 2018. On July 30, 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the Population Council License Agreement, with the Population Council, Inc., or the Population Council, to commercialize ANNOVERA™ in the U.S. In addition, on July 30, 2018, we entered into a license and supply agreement with Knight Therapeutics Inc., or Knight, pursuant to which we granted Knight an exclusive license to commercialize IMVEXXY® and BIJUVA™ in Canada and Israel.
     Our Business Model
     At TherapeuticsMD, we combine entrepreneurial spirit, clinical expertise, and business leadership to develop and commercialize health solutions that enable a new standard of care. Our solutions range from advanced hormone therapy pharmaceutical products to patient-controlled, long-acting contraceptive. We also manufacture and distribute branded and generic prescription prenatal vitamins under the vitaMedMD® and BocaGreenMD® brands. Our purposeful and continuous partnership with healthcare professionals and women is at the heart of our strategies for delivering innovative solutions for women at every stage of her life. From pregnancy to after menopause, we believe the only way to truly connect with and understand women and their healthcare professionals is to ask questions.
     Healthcare has become increasingly consumer driven. Therefore, patients are seeking more information, control, and convenience, which places additional time and financial pressures on physicians, and as a result, physicians are looking for improved ways to provide better service to their patients. A recent study by IMS Health Inc. concluded that physicians desire fewer but more encompassing relationships with companies that can provide more valuable information, deliver more relevant services, and better respond to specific needs of their practice and patients. Our goal is to meet this challenge by focusing on the opportunities in women’s health, specifically the OB/GYN market, to provide a better customer experience for physician, payer, pharmacist, and patient through the following means:
    
● | We will offer physicians a comprehensive product line of women’s healthcare products, across women’s lifecycles.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our hormone therapy drugs and drug candidates are designed to use the lowest effective dose. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our contraceptive product is the only long acting reversible contraceptive option that is patient-controlled and procedure-free.

 
  4 
 


● | We believe the attributes of our prenatal vitamins will result in greater consumer acceptance and satisfaction than competitive products while offering the highest quality products, such as Quatrefolic®, FOLMAX®, FePlus®, and pur-DHA™. All our prenatal vitamins are gluten-, sugar-, and lactose-free.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We strive to improve our existing products and develop new products to generate additional revenue through our existing sales channels. 
● | We believe health care providers, or HCPs, can offer alternatives to patients that meet the patient’s individual nutritional requirements and provide patients a cost that is competitive in the marketplace. 
● | Improved patient education, a high level of patient compliance, and reduced cost of products all result in lower cost of care for payers and improved outcomes for patients. 

 
 At the forefront of our sales approach is the philosophy that the physician should recommend or prescribe products based only on what is best for the patient. In general, a better outcome is achieved by providing patients with the best products and care at the best value. We believe having a portfolio of high-quality product options that can be recommended or prescribed by both the physician and payer is the foundation of providing valuable options to the patient. We are dedicated to enabling healthcare professionals to advance the health of woman by offering new treatment options and giving voice to women’s needs and health concerns. We are committed to partnering with women’s health advocacy organizations as we create and commercialize solutions to help women transform how they experience reproductive health.
     Our sales model focuses on the “4Ps”: patient, provider, pharmacist, and payer. We market and sell our products primarily through a dedicated national sales force that calls on HCPs primarily in the OB/GYN market space. In addition, our products allow HCPs to offer an alternative to patients at a co-payment and that provides patients a cost that is competitive in the marketplace. We also believe that our combination of branded and authorized generic lines of prenatal vitamins offers physicians, women, and payers cost-effective alternatives for top-quality care. We supply our prescription products to consumers through retail pharmacies nationwide. Our fully staffed customer care center uses current customer relationship management software to respond to HCPs, pharmacies, and consumers via incoming and outgoing telephone calls, e-mails, and live-chat.
     We believe our sales force has developed strong relationships in the OB/GYN market to sell our current products. We have also established relationships with some of the largest OB/GYN practices in their respective markets. By delivering additional products through the same sales channel, we believe we can leverage our already deployed assets to increase our sales and achieve profitability. As a result, we will leverage our existing infrastructure, including our sales force, to commercialize our VitaMedMD line of prenatal vitamins and our recently approved products: IMVEXXY®, BIJUVA™, and ANNOVERA™. In addition to our focus on direct selling from our sales organization, we have executed a branded multichannel awareness campaign for HCPs leveraging digital, non-personal promotion and journal advertising and have already reached virtually all the active writing HCPs within the VVA category with IMVEXXY® branded messages. Our sales organization is planned for approximately 200 territories that will cover the most important HCPs for our product portfolio. In addition, we may partner with additional licensors or other strategic partners to commercialize our drugs outside of the OB/GYN market or in non-U.S. markets.
     As of December 31, 2018, we marketed and sold IMVEXXY®, our first FDA approved product and our prescription prenatal vitamins under our vitaMedMD brand name and authorized generic formulations of our prescription prenatal vitamin products under our BocaGreenMD Prena1 brand name. We believe that our vitaMedMD brand name has become a recognized name for high quality women’s healthcare, while our BocaGreenMD products provide physicians, women, and payers with a lower wholesale acquisition cost alternative for prenatal vitamins. We intend to leverage our existing relationships and distribution system to introduce our next two products, BIJUVA™ and ANNOVERA™, which will enable us to provide a comprehensive line of women’s healthcare products.
     Our Growth Strategy
     We believe that the relationships our national sales force has developed with OB/GYN’s, through our current prescription prenatal vitamin products and newly-approved products such as IMVEXXY®, will continue to grow as these products along with ANNOVERA™ and BIJUVA™ offer new opportunities to serve the needs of their patients at each stage of their life. By delivering our entire portfolio through the same sales channel and demonstrating how these products can help women as different needs emerge throughout their lifetime, we believe we can create efficiencies and synergies to further our growth.
     Exclusive Focus on Women’s Health Issues. We have steadily developed relationships with many of the largest OB/GYN practices in the country through the sales of our prenatal vitamins and IMVEXXY®. We believe that our singular focus on women’s health issues will enable us to continue to build long-term relationships with women as they move through their life cycles of family planning to after menopause.
       5 
 
     Focus on Hormone Therapy Products. We plan to continue our focus on the development, clinical trials, and commercialization of bio-identical hormone therapy products designed to (1) alleviate the symptoms of, and reduce the health effects resulting from, menopause-related hormone deficiencies, including VMS and VVA, and (2) demonstrate equivalent clinical efficacy at lower doses. We believe there is a large unmet need in this segment of the market.
     Deepening focus on other parts of a women’s reproductive lifecycle. With the acquisition and forthcoming launch of ANNOVERA™, we are demonstrating our intent to provide effective and innovative products for women at all lifecycle stages.
     Penetrate Compounding Market with FDA-approved Products. We believe BIJUVA™ is the only current FDA-approved hormone therapy combination product that is bio-identical to the estradiol and progesterone produced by the ovaries, and will provide a proven alternative to non-FDA approved compounded bio-identical hormone therapy products, and potentially at a lower price to patients since most insurance companies do not provide coverage for non-FDA approved compounded products. We continue to work with independent and community-based pharmacies that currently compound bio-identical hormone therapy products to help introduce patients and prescribers to our FDA-approved hormone therapy products. We launched the BIO-IGNITE™ program, an outreach program to quantify the number of compounded bio-identical estradiol and progesterone prescriptions currently dispensed by the 3,000-3,500 high-volume compounding pharmacies and qualify their interests in potentially dispensing our FDA-approved products. As part of the BIO-IGNITE™ program, qualified pharmacies may be eligible to participate in certain purchasing groups and wholesaler programs so that offering BIJUVA™ and IMVEXXY® as appropriate treatment alternatives is economically practical for the pharmacy.
     Multi-Channel Marketing Emphasis. We plan to continue our emphasis on large group OB/GYN practices that provide opportunities to reach large patient bases and that are receptive to the data and savings we provide. In addition, we may partner with additional licensors or other strategic partners to commercialize our drugs outside of the OB/GYN market or in non-U.S. markets.  In addition, the proliferation of digital technology has dramatically increased the amount of information available to patients and providers. We believe this makes patient/provider engagement and experience a more important factor for life sciences companies and that providing patients and providers with important information on a real-time basis is a critical piece of serving this market.
     Multiple Distribution Partners. We plan to continue to pursue multiple distribution partners, including large chain pharmacies, independent community pharmacies, mail order and compounding and specialty pharmacies. We believe that providing a higher level of customer care through unique programs targeted at each of these distribution partners can produce better outcomes and value for the patient, provider, and payer.
     Geographical Expansion. We currently plan to expand our geographic marketing footprint in the United States and sales team to approximately 200 professionals as we commercialize IMVEXXY®, BIJUVA™ and ANNOVERA™.
     Commercialization Model 
     We plan to commercialize the products in our portfolio through a common model focused on the belief that providing good experiences for both HCPs and patients will drive profitability for TherapeuticsMD. Given that our portfolio focus is exclusively in women’s health, each new product launch will allow us to further leverage our existing infrastructure and build out our reputation as the premier women’s health organization in the United Sates. Below is more detail on our commercialization model:
● | HCP Education - Initially, we focus on the high writing and high potential HCPs in each territory to gain a full understanding of their prescribing behavior and practices. This provides us with the information to ensure the selling proposition of each drug is within the context of our understanding of each HCP. Our focus is on driving initial prescriptions of these writers for each new product launch and utilizing the time to also pull through on our portfolio of existing products. Once regular writing is established with the initial group of HCPs, we expand our reach to a larger set of HCPs writing in the category. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We accomplish educating HCPs primarily with our field sales organization. We have defined a sales force targeting approximately 200 territories, covering approximately 26,000 HCPs which covers approximately 63% of the addressable market. We are deploying a hybrid sales model that combines an internal sales leadership team with a fully dedicated contract sales force to call on our target HCPs. Additionally, we have an inside sales team that covers areas of the U.S. where key HCPs are located but where we do not have defined territories. In addition to the traditional sales organization, we have launched our key account management organization, or KAMs, to engage with our BIO-IGNITE™ partners.
     In addition to our sales organization, we leverage non-personal promotion (multi-channel advertising) to targets and non-targets that drive awareness, education, and action. These efforts allow for pull through of the sales organization efforts and identification of new targets that have interest in writing prescriptions for one or more of our products. We believe this will drive increased prescribing for our products and lift the overall writing universe by keep the menopause categories and our products top of mind in the HCP community.
       6 
 
    
● | Payer Access - With the ever-changing payer environment, it is critical to maximize breadth of coverage as quickly as possible to not inhibit patient access to product. We do this while working to negotiate the best possible contracts for us. Many commercial payers employ “new-to-market blocks” for newly launched brands until the payers have the opportunity to make a coverage decision based upon their internal review the product. When a product is not covered, the patient is responsible to pay the full price for the medication, which can significantly limit utilization of the product. As we seek to increase the number of lives covered by commercial payers, it is our objective to continue to seek unrestricted coverage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supply - We want to ensure our products are available in all classes of trade and delivery systems. We intend to offer our products through traditional chain wholesalers (Cardinal, McKesson and AmerisourceBergen) and independent retail pharmacies, community compounding pharmacies with our Bio-Ignite program, and mail order. We continue to develop unique opportunities to sell direct to pharmacies to streamline distribution and better control costs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patient Affordability Programs - We have affordability and adherence programs in place for the patient so that we can support appropriate use of the product. Our co-pay assistance programs allow all patients to access the product at a reasonable cost.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patient Adherence - Establishing compliance and adherence programs that make getting on and obtaining prescribed refills easy and convenient for the patient and doctor is a critical lever in our commercial model. Our focus is on minimizing complications in patients filling their first prescription and engaging with them throughout the life of their treatment to ensure patients stay on and use therapy for the appropriate length of time. We believe that the patient engagement programs that we created and piloted around our prescription prenatal vitamin business have the potential to improve patient compliance for all our products. For example, in our prescription prenatal vitamin business, our patient co-pay programs have achieved over 73% utilization in the twelve months ended August 31, 2018 compared to an industry standard of 18%.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumer Communication - Once the fundamentals of our commercialization model are established, we will launch consumer communication. Our initial focus will be on those patients who are already predisposed to seek treatment (new to therapy) and those unhappy with their current therapy. Our next focus will be to expand the market by energizing patients who are experiencing bothersome symptoms but who have not been motived to seek treatment. Methods of communication will include online and offline media and span branded and unbranded communication to ensure we drive action from awareness of symptoms to desire to speak to an HCP to acquire a prescription.

      Industry and Market
     Pharmaceutical Industry
     The pharmaceutical industry is subject to intense competition and is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological change. Competition in our industry occurs in a variety of areas, including developing and bringing new products to market before others, developing new technologies to improve existing products, developing new products to provide the same benefits as existing products at lower cost, and developing new products to provide benefits superior to those of existing products. Most major pharmaceutical companies, as well as numerous specialty pharmaceutical companies, sell products in the women’s health sector of the pharmaceutical industry, which is comprised of products designed for post-pubescent females and is generally considered very fragmented. There are many companies focused on the women’s health sector of the pharmaceutical industry that have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do, including generic manufacturers, drug compounding pharmacies, and large pharmaceutical companies. In addition, academic and other research institutions could be engaged in research and development efforts for the indications targeted by our products.     Women’s Healthcare Market
     According to the BBC Research report “Pharmaceuticals for Women’s Health: Global markets to 2023,” post-menopausal osteoporosis, pregnancy disorders and management, menopause, endometriosis, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are the largest segments within the global market for women’s health therapeutics. The global market for women’s health therapeutics reached nearly $30.5 billion in 2018 and should reach nearly $37.3 billion by 2023, at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 4.2% for the period of 2018-2023. In addition, the menopause market for women’s health therapeutics reached $5.4 billion in 2018 and should reach $6.7 billion by 2023 at a CAGR of 4.5% through 2023. According to the GBI Research (a provider of industry-leading business intelligence solutions on a global basis) report “Women’s Health Therapeutic Market through 2018,” the women’s health therapeutics market is one of the most attractive markets in the global pharmaceutical industry.
       7 
 
     Menopause Market
     Menopause is the spontaneous and permanent cessation of menstruation, which naturally occurs in most women between the ages of 40 and 58. Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment in the United States and Canada for relief of menopausal symptoms according to the North American Menopause Society, or NAMS. These symptoms are caused by the reduced levels of circulating estrogen as ovarian production shuts down. The symptoms include hot flashes, night sweats, sleep disturbances, and vaginal dryness. According to Symphony Health Solutions, prescriptions for FDA-approved hormone therapy products for the treatment of menopause symptoms or prevention of osteoporosis generated total U.S. sales of over $5.0 billion on over 30 million prescriptions for the 12 months ended December 31, 2018, of which prescriptions for oral hormone therapy accounted for approximately $2.1 billion in U.S. sales on 20 million prescriptions over the same period.
     Prescriptions for menopausal hormone therapy in the United States dropped significantly following the Women’s Health Initiative, or WHI, study in 2002, which found that subjects using conjugated equine estrogens plus the synthetic progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate had, among other things, a greater incidence of coronary heart disease, breast cancer, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. Several additional studies regarding the benefits and risks of hormone therapy have been conducted over the last decade since the WHI results were first published. The FDA recommends that women with moderate-to-severe menopausal symptoms who want to try menopausal hormone therapy for relief use it for the shortest time needed and at the lowest effective dose.
     There were approximately 41.7 million women in the United States between the ages of 45 and 64 in 2010, projected to increase slightly by 2.8% to 42.9 million in 2015 and to approximately 44.3 million in 2040, according to the 2010 National Census population figures.
     Hormone Therapy Products for Menopause
     Estrogen (with or without a progestin) is the most effective treatment of VMS and VVA due to menopause according to NAMS. According to Symphony Health Solutions, total U.S. sales of FDA-approved oral, transdermal, and suppository estrogen (with and without a progestin) hormone therapy products were approximately $4.1 billion for the 12 months ended December 31, 2018. The three primary hormone therapy products are estrogen, progestin, and combination of estrogen and progestin, which are produced in a variety of forms, including oral tablets or capsules, skin patches, gels, emulsion, or vaginal suppositories and creams.
     Estrogen-Only Therapies for Menopause
     Estrogen therapies are used to treat VMS due to menopause that are a direct result of the decline in estrogen levels associated with ovarian shutdown at menopause. Estrogen therapy has been used to manage these symptoms for more than 50 years. Estrogen is a generic term for any substance, natural or synthetic, that exerts biological effects characteristic of estrogenic hormones, such as estradiol, a natural ovarian produced estrogen. Based upon the age demographic for all women receiving prescriptions for estrogen therapy and the average age range during which women experience VMS, we believe that estrogen is primarily used for the treatment of VMS, but also is prescribed for the prevention of osteoporosis.
     Estrogen-only therapy, or ET, is used primarily in women who have had a hysterectomy and/or have undergone surgical menopause, as those women do not require a progestin to protect the uterine endometrium. Approximately 433,000 women undergo a hysterectomy each year in the United States according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ET is also used for the treatment of VVA, which has a variety of indications, including dyspareunia (painful intercourse), vaginal dryness, vaginal itching and irritation, painful urination, and other symptoms.
     ET is also approved for the prevention of osteoporosis. Multiple studies conducted on various estrogen compositions, including studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2002, Osteoporosis International in 2000, The Lancet in 2002, Maturitas in 2008, and Climacteric in 2005, suggested efficacy based on increases in bone mineral density. Epidemiological and some fracture prevention studies, such as the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1980, also have suggested a decrease in bone fractures as a result of ET.
     According to Symphony Health Solutions, total FDA-approved ET only U.S. sales amounted to $4.1 billion, of which $1.9 billion was specifically used for the treatment of VVA, for the 12 months ended December 31, 2018. 
       8 
 
     Progestin-Only Therapies for Menopause
     Progestins include the naturally occurring hormone progesterone and several synthetic progestin compounds that have progestational activity. These agents are used for a variety of indications and conditions, but most often, progestins are used either alone or in combination with an estrogen for hormonal contraception and to prevent endometrial hyperplasia from unopposed estrogen in hormone therapy. Progestins alone are also used to treat women with secondary amenorrhea to create withdrawal bleeding in these women who have not had regular menses. Progestins are also used to treat dysfunctional uterine bleeding and endometriosis. Progesterone has also been used to prevent threatened or recurrent pregnancy loss and for the prevention of preterm birth. Progestins have also been used in fertility treatments. Progestins have also been used as a palliative measure for metastatic endometrial carcinoma and in the treatment of renal and breast carcinoma.
     Estrogen/Progestin Combination Products for Menopause
     Progestins are used in combination with estrogen in menopausal women with uteruses to avoid an increase in the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia, which is a condition caused by chronic use of estrogen alone by a woman with a uterus and is associated with an increased incidence of uterine, or endometrial, cancer. Studies have shown that, after one year, the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia is less than 1% in women taking estrogen/progestin combinations, in contrast to up to 20% in women taking estrogen alone. In accordance with FDA recommendations, doctors typically recommend that a menopausal or post-menopausal woman who has a uterus take estrogen plus a progestin, either as a combination drug or as two separate drugs. Symphony Health Solutions estimates that sales of FDA-approved combinations of estrogen and progestins were approximately $580 million and the sales of estrogens and progesterone on a stand-alone basis were approximately $1.6 million and approximately $746 million, respectively, in the United States for the 12 months ended December 31, 2018. According to national surveys of compounding pharmacists, it is estimated that compounding pharmacies fill $1.3 billion annually in menopausal hormone therapy.
      Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Market
     According to the EvaluatePharma® World Preview 2018, Outlook to 2024 report, despite the global pharmaceutical industry facing pricing and market access concerns, worldwide prescription drug sales are expected to reach approximately $1.2 trillion by 2024, which would represent a compound annual growth rate of approximately 6.4% between 2018 and 2024. New drug approvals in 2017 increased to 55 (consisting of new molecular entities and biologics), up 104% as compared to the low of 27 approvals in 2016. Following the drop in 2016 approvals, 2017 suggests a return to form in industry research and development productivity. A record of 55 new molecular entities were approved in 2017 with total US sales five years post launch for products approved in 2017 reaching $33.2 billion. There were 56 new drugs (consisting of new molecular entities and biologics) approved by FDA in 2015 and 51 new drugs approved by FDA in 2014. The value of these drugs continues to be high, and with U.S. five years post-launch sales of the new drugs approved in 2017, 2016 and 2015 forecast to be over $33 billion, $13 billion, $28 billion, respectively.     Our Hormone Therapy Drugs
     IMVEXXY®
     On May 30, 2018, we announced that the FDA had approved the 4 μg and 10 μg doses of IMVEXXY® (estradiol vaginal inserts) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe dyspareunia (vaginal pain associated with sexual activity), a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. The 4-μg formulation of IMVEXXY® represents the lowest FDA-approved dose of vaginal estradiol available. IMVEXXY® 10-μg became available for commercial distribution in late July 2018 and both doses were commercially available by September 2018.
     As part of the FDA’s approval of IMVEXXY®, we have committed to conduct a post-approval observational study to evaluate the risk of endometrial cancer in post-menopausal women with a uterus who use a low-dose vaginal estrogen unopposed by a progestogen. The FDA has also asked the sponsors of other vaginal estrogen products to also participate in the observational study. In connection with the observational study, we will be required to provide progress reports to the FDA on an annual basis. The development of this method is underway, and we do not believe that the costs will be material. In addition, the FDA asked for post-approval information with respect to certain characteristics related to the product’s specifications, which we submitted to FDA.
     IMVEXXY® Commercialization Update
     On July 9, 2018, we launched IMVEXXY® 10-μg with our early experience program to a targeted sample of HCPs throughout the U.S. The national launch of the 10-μg dose of IMVEXXY® began in August 2018, and the 4-μg dose of IMVEXXY® launched on September 13, 2018.
       9 
 
     Since FDA approval of our NDA for IMVEXXY®, we have been focused on executing our launch plan. The key objectives of our launch plan include: (i) providing broad commercial access at the retail level and with commercial payers, (ii) increasing awareness and appreciation of the clinical and patient features of IMVEXXY® amongst HCPs, (iii) designing and deploying our customer facing model, and (iv) developing our internal capabilities (for example, in the areas of finance, human resources, medical affairs, information technology, data analytics, pharmacovigilance capacity and compliance) to support our commercial-stage company. We have made progress in each of these key strategic areas:
     Commercial Access:
    
● | Both the 4-μg and 10-μg doses of IMVEXXY® are broadly available in major pharmacy chains in the U.S., as well as with our BIO-IGNITE™ partners, via our third-party logistics and our distribution partners.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have aggressively sought commercial payer coverage as many commercial payers employ “new-to-market blocks” for newly launched brands until the payers make a coverage decision based upon their internal review the product. As we seek to increase the number of lives covered by commercial payers, it is our objective to continue to seek unrestricted coverage that involves affordable access for patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Through December 31, 2018, we achieved unrestricted coverage with 3 of the top 10 commercial payers of VVA products and we continue to sign new agreements with payers to cover IMVEXXY®.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Beginning at launch, we instituted a patient education and affordability program that allows all eligible patients who enroll to receive IMVEXXY® at an affordable out-of-pocket cost. When a product is not covered, the patient is responsible to pay the full price for the medication, which can significantly limit a patient’s ability to pay and subsequent utilization of the product. With our co-pay assistance program, enrolled patients do not pay more than $35 for a prescription of IMVEXXY®.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Brand Awareness and Adoption:
    
● | In addition to our focus on direct selling from our sales organization, we have executed a branded multichannel awareness campaign for HCPs leveraging digital, non-personal promotion and journal advertising and have already reached most of the active writing HCPs within the VVA category with IMVEXXY® branded messages. The focus of our interactions with HCPs included: (i) introducing IMVEXXY® and highlighting the unmet medical that IMVEXXY® can fulfill for many women, (ii) increasing awareness of the clinical data and patient features of IMVEXXY®, and (iii) familiarizing HCPs with our patient support services for IMVEXXY®. Based on our early sales effectiveness research, more than 90% of HCPs that responded to our surveys indicated that they have prescribed or intend to prescribe IMVEXXY®. As of December 31, 2018, more than 7,000 HCPs had sent an IMVEXXY® prescription to a pharmacy for at least one patient.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Patient Affordability and Adherence Programs:
    
● | We believe the patient affordability and adherence programs that we created and piloted around our prescription prenatal vitamin business have the potential to improve patient compliance for IMVEXXY®, compared to other products in the VVA category. For example, in our prescription prenatal vitamin business, our patient co-pay programs have achieved over 73% utilization in the twelve months ended August 31, 2018 compared to an industry standard of 18%. We launched our patient affordability and adherence program for IMVEXXY® to help patients manage out-of-pocket costs (eligible patients pay no more than $35 per prescription) and improve education regarding VVA and IMVEXXY® with the goal of increasing patient adherence and compliance for an improved treatment experience. As of December 31, 2018, we have seen that 90% of our IMVEXXY® patients have enrolled in the patients saving programs. We expect this level to continue into 2019. We plan to launch print and digital direct-to-consumer marketing for IMVEXXY® in the second half of 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we have approximately 25,000 patients who have received at least one paid prescription filled at a pharmacy.

      Customer Model:
    
● | As of December 31, 2018, we had a sales force targeting approximately 150 territories, covering approximately 25,000 HCPs, and deploying a hybrid sales model that combines an internal sales leadership team with a fully dedicated contract sales force to call on our customer universe. Additionally, we have an internal sales team that covers areas of the U.S. where key HCPs are located but where we do not have defined territories and have launched our Key Account Managers (KAMs) to engage with our BIO-IGNITE™ partners.

        10 
 
     Infrastructure:
    
● | We continue to develop our internal capabilities and sales force to support the launch of IMVEXXY®. We have launched KAMs to support our BIO-IGNITE™ partners and continue to build our internal capabilities to support both organizations, including compliance professionals and programs and key data support systems that provide real-time data for the sales force and KAMs.

      Competition
     According to Symphony Health Solutions, the FDA-approved U.S. market for treatment of VVA in menopausal women was approximately $2.0 billion for the 12 months ended December 31, 2018. Approximately $1.7 billion of such sales were by three products currently on the market: PREMARIN® cream (Pfizer), ESTRACE® cream, both brand and generic (Allergan and Mylan) and Vagifem® which is now mostly generic (Yuvafem by Amneal Pharmaceuticals). The two recent launches were Osphena® (Duchesnay USA, Inc) and Intrarosa® (Amag Pharmaceuticals), which still have relatively small market share.     BIJUVA™ 
     On October 28, 2018, the FDA approved BIJUVA™ (estradiol and progesterone) capsules, 1 mg/100 mg, the first and only FDA-approved bio-identical hormone therapy combination of estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral capsule for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms, or VMS (commonly known as hot flashes or flushes), due to menopause in women with a uterus. The estrogen and progesterone in BIJUVA™ have the same chemical and molecular structure as the hormones that are naturally produced in a woman’s body. With the approval of BIJUVA™, the FDA required a post-approval commitment to further develop and validate our in-vitro dissolution method to show how BIJUVA™ is released from the capsule in an in-vitro setting for quality control assessments. The development of this method and validation were completed and submitted to FDA as required in our approval.
     We believe the substitutable menopausal hormone therapy market for BIJUVA™ consists of three distinct product categories, two of which are FDA-approved products that are easily measured and monitored, and the third of which is typically referred to as “bio-identicals,” which are not FDA-approved, not easily measured, and sold through compounding pharmacies. The first category, representing approximately 2.5 million annual prescriptions as of December 31, 2018, is for FDA-approved synthetic hormone combinations, which have been linked to the risks identified in the WHI, and do not represent our target market. The other two categories consist of bio-identical hormone markets that represent our target market. The second category includes approximately 3.9 million prescriptions of FDA-approved separate bio-identical hormone products, like Estrace® and Prometrium®, as of December 31, 2018. This bio-identical hormone regimen has not been studied or FDA-approved to be used together. Instead, these products are often used off-label to provide patients with an FDA-approved bio-identical hormone regimen but require two separate copays as well as issues related to compliance with separate products. We believe that there is no reason healthcare providers and patients would continue to use this combination of two separate products once BIJUVA™ is available. The third and largest category represents at least 10 million prescriptions annually of the unapproved, compounded bio-identical hormones that have not been proven safe and effective, are not covered by insurance, and are substitutable with BIJUVA™.
     The approval of BIJUVA™, based on the phase 3 clinical trials established for the first time, a combination of bio-identical estradiol and bio-identical progesterone used in a continuous combined daily fashion with safety and efficacy data to support FDA-approval. Our hormone therapy drugs are characterized by safety and efficacy profiles that can be consistently manufactured to target specifications. This would provide an alternative to the non-FDA approved compounded bio-identical market. We believe that our drugs offer advantages in terms of demonstrated safety and efficacy, consistency in the hormone dose, lower patient cost due to the increased likelihood of insurance coverage and improved access as a result of availability from major retail pharmacy chains rather than custom order or formulation by individual compounders.
     BIJUVA™ is planned to launch early in the second quarter of 2019 with a similar model to IMVEXXY®. The key objectives of our launch plan include: (i) broad commercial access at the retail level and with commercial payers, (ii) increasing awareness and appreciation of the clinical and patient features of BIJUVA™ amongst HCPs, (iii) expanding and leveraging our existing customer facing model, and (iv) leverage our internal capabilities (for example, in the areas of finance, human resources, information technology, data analytics and compliance) to support launch of BIJUVA™.
     Our focus will first be on key OB/GYN targets, particularly those that have already adopted IMVEXXY®, to deliver the core clinical messages as well as provide information on our patient affordability and adherence programs. In support of BIJUVA™, our field force is expanding to approximately 200 territories. In addition, we will continue to expand our BIO-IGNITE program throughout 2019 with a fuller expansion towards the end of 2019 when the six-month payer block for BIJUVA™ is expected to lift.
       11 
 

 We believe that the successful launch of IMVEXXY® will allow us to leverage existing contracts with our third-party logistics partner and our distribution partners. With regards to payer coverage, we anticipate similar timing as experienced with IMVEXXY® as many commercial payers employ “new-to-market blocks” for newly launched brands until they have the opportunity to make a coverage decision based upon their internal review. However, our ability to leverage existing payer contracts by amending to include BIJUVA™ along with our recent experience with the payers may simplify the process.
     Symphony Health Solutions estimates that sales of FDA-approved combinations of estrogen and progestins were approximately $580 million and the sales of estrogens and progesterone on a stand-alone basis were approximately $1.6 million and approximately $746 million, respectively, in the United States for the 12 months ended December 31, 2018. According to national surveys of compounding pharmacists, it is estimated that compounding pharmacies fill $1.3 billion annually in menopausal hormone therapy.
      Competition
     The largest competitors for BIJUVA™ in the FDA-approved market are Pfizer (PREMPRO®) and Premarin, Teva and Mylan (generic estradiol, generic version of Estrace® oral), and Noven (CombiPatch®), with sales of PREMPRO® constituting the largest branded product. None of the current FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of moderate-to-severe VMS due to menopause are bio-identical to both the estradiol and progesterone produced by the ovaries. Based on various reports, including data recently presented at the NAMS Annual Meeting, “Knowledge, Use, and Prescribing of Custom-Compounded Bioidentical Hormones for Menopausal Women: It’s Not What You Think,” by JoAnn V. Pinkerton, et al., we estimate that U.S. sales of non-FDA-approved compounded combination addressable estradiol and progesterone products approximate $1.5 billion per year. The market for non-FDA-approved compounded hormone therapy products is generally considered very fragmented because the products are prepared and sold by individual compounding pharmacies. We believe that BIJUVA™ represents the first time a combination product of estradiol and progesterone that is bio-identical to the estradiol and progesterone produced by the ovaries in a single combined product.     ANNOVERA™
     On July 30, 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Population Council to commercialize in the U.S. ANNOVERA™ (segesterone acetate/ethinyl estradiol vaginal system), the first and only patient-controlled, procedure-free, reversible prescription contraceptive that can prevent pregnancy for up a full year, which was approved by the FDA on August 10, 2018. ANNOVERA™ was classified by the FDA as a “new chemical entity,” or NCE, and thus has five years of regulatory exclusivity under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
     ANNOVERA™ is a one-year ring-shaped contraceptive vaginal system, or CVS. ANNOVERA™, which is made with a silicone elastomer, contains segesterone acetate, a 19-nor progesterone derivative also known as Nestorone®, or NES, and ethinyl estradiol, or EE. EE is an approved active ingredient in many marketed hormonal products. Segesterone acetate, a new chemical entity, is a potent progestin that is not active orally but is active when administered via non-oral routes such as vaginal rings, implants, and transdermal systems. NES has been evaluated in 51 clinical studies across these delivery systems with more than 26,794 cycles of exposure.
     ANNOVERA™ can be inserted and removed by the woman herself without the aid of a healthcare provider and, unlike oral contraceptives, or OCs, ANNOVERA™ does not require daily administration to obtain the contraceptive effect. After 21 days of use, the woman removes ANNOVERA™ for 7 days, thereby providing a regular bleeding pattern (i.e., withdrawal/scheduled bleeding). The same CVS is then re-inserted for additional 21/7-days in/out, for up to a total of 13 cycles (1 year).
     ANNOVERA™ releases daily vaginal doses of both active ingredients (NES and EE). The claimed release rate of 150 μg/day NES and 13/day μg EE is supported by the calculated average release rate from an ex vivo analysis of ANNOVERA™ used for 13 cycles and is also supported by data from 13 cycles of in vitro release.
     We currently estimate that ANNOVERA™ will be commercially available as early as the third quarter of 2019 with a planned full commercial launch by the first quarter of 2020. We intend to leverage our existing infrastructure, including our sales force, to commercialize ANNOVERA™, together with our recently approved IMVEXXY® and BIJUVA™. ANNOVERA™ will also follow the same commercialization model as IMVEXXY® and BIJUVA™.
       12 
 
     Contraception market
     Contraception can be defined as the deliberate prevention of pregnancy by interfering with normal process of ovulation, fertilization and implantation through the use of barriers, drugs, medical devices, or surgical techniques. Contraceptive market includes non-hormonal barrier methods, such as the non-hormonal IUD, contraceptive sponge, diaphragm, cervical cap or shield and condoms, and hormonal methods such as oral contraceptives, injections, implants, hormonal IUDs and vaginal ring and transdermal contraceptive products. Contraceptive drugs include pills, topical, and injectables. Hormonal contraceptives can be composed of synthetic estrogens and progestins. Contraceptives containing both estrogen and a progestin are referred to as combination hormonal contraceptives, or CHCs, and contraceptives containing only progestin are referred to as progestin-only, or P-only. There are three synthetic estrogens approved in the United States for use in contraceptive products: EE, mestranol, or ME, and estradiol valerate, or EV. EE has been available for over 40 years and is the estrogen component in nearly all CHCs today. There are 10 different progestins that have been used in contraceptives sold in the United States. The progestin component provides most of the contraceptive effect, while the estrogen component primarily provides cycle control, for example, minimizing bleeding or spotting between cycles. The progestin exerts its contraceptive effect by inhibiting ovulation, or release of an egg from the ovary, and by thickening cervical mucus. Thickening cervical mucus helps to prevent sperm entry into the upper genital tract. The estrogen component, in addition to providing cycle control, makes a small contribution to contraception by decreasing the maturation of the egg in the ovary. The latest data from 2015 to 2017 from the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, indicate that approximately 65% of women aged 15 to 49 were using some type of contraceptive method. Most women who were not using contraception had reasons for not doing so, such as seeking pregnancy, being pregnant or postpartum, or not being sexually active.
     According to Grand View Research: “Contraceptives Market Analysis By Drug (Oral Contraceptive Pills, Injectables, Topical), By Device (Male, Female Condoms, Copper, Hormonal IUD, Vaginal Rings, Subdermal Implants) And Segment Forecasts To 2022,” male and female condoms, vaginal implants, subdermal implants, diaphragms, sponges, and intrauterine devices, or IUDs, are key devices and accounted for the largest share of the contraceptives market in terms of revenue. The IUD segment held one of the largest shares of the contraceptive devices in 2014, owing to the rising demand in the regions of Europe and Asia Pacific. A rising number of gynecologists opting for these contraception devices is expected to drive this segment over the forecast period. Contraceptive pills dominated the overall drugs market in 2014 in terms of revenue, owing to a significantly large consumer base, very high usage and government programs and initiatives to address the unmet needs of the women of the reproductive age. TherapeuticsMD now has presence in both the early and late reproductive years with our portfolio.
     The U.S. contraceptive market size is expected to reach at $11.6 billion by 2025 expanding at a CAGR of 5.3% over the forecast period, according to Grand View Research, Inc. Increasing awareness about LARC is expected to augment the product demand, thereby driving the market over the next few years. According to the National Center for Health and Statistics, the use of LARCs in the U.S. has increased nearly five-fold in the last decade among women aged 15 to 44 and, we believe, that this segment of the contraceptive market is attractive given its current growth trajectory. We believe that the increasing awareness about long-acting reversible contraceptive options will grow incremental product demand, thereby driving market growth over the coming years. This is currently led by IUDs. The market leader in the IUD market is Bayer with the following products: Mirena®, Kyleena®, Jaydess® and Skyla®. The remainder of the market is dominated by oral contraceptives, which is represented by one major brand, Lo Loestrin® Fe by Allergan, and a variety of generics led by generic manufacturers such as Teva Pharmaceuticals and Lupin Pharma.
     Contraception Competition
     The industry for contraceptive products is characterized by intense competition and strong promotion of proprietary products. While we believe that ANNOVERA™ provides us with a competitive advantage, we may face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical device companies. We expect that primary competition for ANNOVERA™ will come from oral contraceptives, a vaginal ring contraceptive and LARCs. The vaginal ring contraceptive is represented by NuvaRing, (etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring), a monthly contraceptive ring marketed by Merck. LARC methods include two types of contraceptives: IUDs and subcutaneous hormone-releasing implants. It has been reported that newer LARC products have recently gained in popularity, potentially due to their lower rates of side effects, greater effectiveness, and broader acceptability among different populations of women.
     For patients, we believe that ANNOVERA™ provides a single long-acting reversible birth control product that would not require a procedure for insertion at a doctor’s office, empowering women to be in complete control of their fertility and menstruation with a 21/7 regime. We anticipate that ANNOVERA™ is acceptable for nulliparous women, or women who have never given birth. Further, ANNOVERA™ is softer and more pliable than NuvaRing and, unlike NuvaRing, does not require refrigeration before being prescribed. NuvaRing generated approximately $564 million, $576 million and $515 million in net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, based on approximately 4.3 million, 4.5 million and 4.4 million prescriptions, respectively. We believe that ANNOVERA™ will have significant competitive advantages to NuvaRing and anticipated generic versions of NuvaRing, including the ability to fill a one-year prescription in one pharmacy visit and the lack of a requirement to refrigerate the ring.
     ANNOVERA™ Commercialization Strategy
     We believe that our existing sales territories cover a majority of the area where the leading monthly contraceptive ring prescribers are located. Our existing HCP targets represent approximately 87% of the current prescription volume of the leading monthly contraceptive ring. We believe, this will allow us to have strong coverage of target HCPs while using our existing sales force to commercialize ANNOVERA™. We intend to add a dedicated marketing team exclusively focused on ANNOVERA™ and believe that much of the marketing plan will focus in the digital space given the target patient demographics.
       13 
 
     We believe that the unique characteristics of ANNOVERA™ will assist us in pursuing favorable commercial payer coverage, including only one pharmacy fill fee per year and no office visit or procedure fees. However, obtaining and maintaining favorable reimbursement can be a time-consuming and expensive process, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to negotiate or continue to negotiate reimbursement or pricing terms for our products, including ANNOVERA™, with payers at profitable levels.
     In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the ACA, mandates that private health plans provide coverage for women’s preventative services, without imposing patient cost-sharing requirements, as recommended by the Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA. HRSA Guidelines require private health plans to cover, without cost-sharing, at least one form of contraception, or product, in each of the methods, or classes, identified by the FDA for women in its Birth Control Guide, which currently includes 18 separate classes. For classes with more than one type of treatment, private payers need only provide no-cost coverage for one product in each class and may use reasonable medical management to determine whether and to what extent to cover other products in the class. We believe, that given no other vaginal contraceptive product offers contraceptive benefits for an entire year that it is possible that FDA could determine that ANNOVERA™ constitutes a new class of contraceptive, which could allow for coverage of ANNOVERA™ by private health plans with no out-of-pocket cost for patients. However, it is possible that other FDA-approved products could also be included in such a new class. To the extent ANNOVERA™ is not the only FDA-approved product in a designated class of contraception, private payers may choose not to cover ANNOVERA™ or may require patient cost-sharing obligations.
     As part of the Population Council License Agreement, we have agreed to provide significantly reduced pricing to federally designated Title X family planning clinics serving underrepresented women.
     The Population Council has previously entered into a supply agreement with Crystal Pharma SAU for the supply of Nestorone®, one of the active pharmaceutical ingredients for ANNOVERA™, and a letter agreement with QPharma AB for the optimization of the commercial manufacturing process for ANNOVERA™. We intend to enter into agreements Crystal Pharma SAU for the supply of Nestorone® and the Population Council has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us in doing so. However, Crystal Pharma could decline to enter into similar agreements with us on the terms we anticipate, or at all. We entered into a manufacturing agreement with QPharma for the manufacturing of ANNOVERA™, with an effective date of September 28, 2018.
     License Agreement with the Population Council
     Under the terms of the Population Council License Agreement, we paid the Population Council a milestone payment of $20 million within 30 days following approval by the FDA of the NDA for ANNOVERA™ and will be required to pay the Population Council an additional $20 million within 30 days following the release of the first commercial batch of ANNOVERA™. The Population Council is also eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties from commercial sales of ANNOVERA™, as detailed below.
     We assumed responsibility for marketing expenses related to the commercialization of ANNOVERA™.
     We are required to pay the Population Council milestone payments of $40 million upon cumulative net sales of ANNOVERA™ in the U.S. by us and our affiliates and permitted sublicensees of each of $200.0 million, $400.0 million and $1.0 billion.
     In addition, we are required to pay the Population Council, on a quarterly basis, step-based royalty payments based on annual net sales of ANNOVERA™ in the U.S. by us and our affiliates and permitted sublicensees as follows:
    
Annual Net Sales | Royalty Rate | 
--------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+--
Less than or equal to $50.0 million | 5 | %
Greater than $50.0 million and less than or equal to $150.0 million | 10 | %
Greater than $150.0 million | 15 | %

 
 The annual royalty rate will be reduced to 50% of the initial rate during the six-month period beginning on the date of the first arms-length commercial sale of a generic equivalent of ANNOVERA™ that is launched by a third party in the U.S., and thereafter will be reduced to 20% of the initial rate.
     As part of the approval of ANNOVERA™, the FDA has required a post-approval observational study be performed to measure the risk of venous thromboembolism. A protocol submission for the study is due to the FDA in August 2019. We have agreed to perform and pay the costs and expenses associated with this post-approval study, provided that if the costs and expenses associated with such post-approval study exceed $20 million, half of such excess will be offset against royalties or other payments owed by us to the Population Council under the Population Council License Agreement. Given the observational nature of the study, we do not believe that the costs of the study will be material on an annual basis.
       14 
 
     Unless earlier terminated, the Population Council License Agreement will remain in effect until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire of the Population Council’s U.S. patents that are licensed to us, or the date following such expiration that follows a continuous period of six months during which we and our affiliates have not made a commercial sale of ANNOVERA™ in the U.S. The Population Council License Agreement may also be terminated for certain breach and bankruptcy-related events and by us on 180 days prior notice to the Population Council.
     As part of the Population Council License Agreement, we have the exclusive right to negotiate co-development and U.S. marketing rights for two other investigational vaginal contraceptive systems in development by the Population Council: a three-month contraceptive ring using Nestorone® plus bio-identical estradiol, which is currently in phase 2 clinical trials, and a new one-year contraceptive ring using Nestorone® plus EE, which is designed as a life cycle management product for the CVS that we have licensed.
     License Agreement with Knight Therapeutics Inc.
     On July 30, 2018, we entered into a license and supply agreement, or the Knight License Agreement, with Knight pursuant to which we granted Knight an exclusive license to commercialize IMVEXXY® and BIJUVA™ in Canada and Israel.
     Under the Knight License Agreement, Knight will pay us milestone fees when it receives regulatory approval in Canada for: (i) IMVEXXY®; and (ii) BIJUVA™. Additional milestone fees and royalties are based upon certain aggregate annual sales in Canada and Israel for both IMVEXXY® and BIJUVA™. Knight will be responsible for all regulatory and commercial activities in Canada and Israel related to IMVEXXY® and BIJUVA™.
     We may terminate the Knight License Agreement if Knight does not submit all regulatory applications, submissions or registrations required for regulatory approval to use and commercialize IMVEXXY® and BIJUVA™ in Canada within certain specified time periods. Either party may terminate the Knight License Agreement for any material breach by the other party that is not cured within certain specified time periods or if the other party files for bankruptcy or other related matters.
     Our Prenatal Vitamin Products
     As we commercialize our recently approved hormone therapy drugs, we continue to manufacture and distribute our prescription prenatal vitamins product lines under our vitaMedMD® brand name and authorized generic formulations of some of our prescription prenatal vitamin products under our BocaGreenMD® Prena1 name. We believe that our vitaMedMD brand name has become a recognized name for high quality women’s health care, while our BocaGreenMD products provide physicians, women, and payers with a lower wholesale acquisition cost alternative for prenatal vitamins. As of January 1, 2017, we decided to focus on selling our prescription vitamins and ceased manufacturing and distributing our over-the-counter, or OTC, product lines, except for Iron 21/7 which we ceased manufacturing and distributing in October 2017. The sales of discontinued products have declined steadily over time resulting in immaterial sales.
     In March 2012, we launched our first prescription prenatal vitamin, vitaMedMD Plus Rx, with subsequent launches of our second prescription prenatal vitamin, vitaMedMD One Rx, in April 2012 and our third prescription prenatal vitamin, vitaMedMD RediChew™ Rx, in May 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we launched our BocaGreenMD Prena1 line of prescription prenatal vitamins, which included three prescription prenatal vitamins that were authorized generic formulations of our vitaMedMD-branded prescription prenatal vitamins. In the first quarter of 2014, we introduced a new prescription prenatal vitamin product under our branded vitaMedMD name as vitaPearl and under our authorized generic Prena1 name as Prena1 Pearl, which features a unique, proprietary combination of FOLMAX™, FePlus™, and pur-DHA™. In January 2016, we launched vitaTrue. Our current vitamin product line is as follows:
    
● | vitaTrueTM

      For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, approximately 93%, 99.9%, and 99.8%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was generated by our prenatal vitamin products.
       15 
 
     Prenatal Vitamin Market
     According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are approximately four million births per year in the U.S. Of women giving birth in the U.S., the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that approximately 73% received early prenatal care in the first trimester, while 6% began prenatal care in the third trimester or did not receive any prenatal care. Most doctors encourage taking a prenatal vitamin as the recommended standard of care. Prenatal vitamins are dietary supplements intended to be taken before and during pregnancy and during postnatal lactation that provide nutrients recognized by various health organizations as helpful for a healthy pregnancy outcome.
     The prenatal vitamin market is highly fragmented, with dozens of companies selling hundreds of competitive products. Prenatal vitamin products are marketed as either OTC products or prescription products, with many companies marketing their products through both channels. According to Symphony Health Solutions, during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018, approximately 5.4 million prescriptions for prenatal vitamins were issued in the United States resulting in total sales of approximately $338 million.
     Pipeline for Our Hormone Therapy Drug Candidates
     TX-002HR
     TX-002HR is a natural progesterone formulation for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea without the potentially allergenic component of peanut oil. The hormone therapy drug candidate is bio-identical to – or having the same chemical and molecular structure as - the hormones that naturally occur in a woman’s body. We believe it will be similarly effective to traditional treatments, but may demonstrate efficacy at lower dosages. In January 2014, we began recruitment of patients in the SPRY Trial, a phase 3 clinical trial designed to measure the safety and effectiveness of TX-002HR in the treatment of secondary amenorrhea. During the first two quarters of 2014, the SPRY Trial encountered enrollment challenges because of Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approved clinical trial protocols and FDA inclusion and exclusion criteria. In July 2014, we suspended enrollment and in October 2014 we stopped the SPRY Trial to update the phase 3 protocol based on discussions with the FDA. Our IND related to TX-002HR is currently inactive. We are considering updating the phase 3 protocol to, among other things, target only those women with secondary amenorrhea due to polycystic ovarian syndrome and to amend the primary endpoint of the trial. We believe that the updated phase 3 protocol, if proposed by us and approved by the FDA, would allow us to mitigate the enrollment challenges in, and shorten the duration of, the SPRY Trial. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will approve the updated phase 3 protocol if we propose it. We have suspended further development of this drug candidate to prioritize our leading drugs.
     TX-003HR
     TX-003HR is a natural estradiol formulation. This hormone therapy drug candidate is bio-identical to the hormones that naturally occur in a woman’s body. We currently do not have plans to further develop this hormone therapy drug candidate. Our IND related to TX-003HR is currently inactive. We have suspended further development of this drug candidate to prioritize our leading drugs.
     Preclinical Development
     We have four preclinical projects that include development of a progesterone-alone and combination estradiol and progesterone products in a topical cream form, which we refer to as TX-005HR and TX-006HR, respectively, and transdermal patch form, which we refer to as TX-00THR and TX-0008HR, respectively. We completed a proof-of-concept preclinical study of TX-005HR in 32 rats. The study used four groups of eight female ovariectomized rats, each of whom were treated with subcutaneous injections of estradiol for eight days. On day four of treatment, they were dosed with a placebo, subcutaneous injections of progesterone, or a dose of TX-005HR topical progesterone cream. The results, presented at NAMS meeting in October 2015, showed that the progesterone in TX-005HR penetrated the skin and opposed the effect of subcutaneous estradiol on the endometrium. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we submitted an IND application for TX-006HR. In 2018, we investigated the capability of the estradiol and progesterone in TX-006HR to penetrate human skin. This experiment used donated skin from a postmenopausal woman and showed significant penetration of both active ingredients. We may in the future engage with a financing partner to advance our topical cream and transdermal patch projects. We have also developed and patented novel, oral formulations of progesterone that have shown improved bioavailability in animals. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we submitted an IND for TX-009HR, an estradiol and progesterone containing oral formulation. In addition to menopausal treatments, we are also evaluating various other indications for our hormone technology, including contraception.

     The pharmaceutical markets in which we compete are not subject to seasonal sales fluctuation.  However, our net revenues for the first quarter of each year can be negatively affected by the annual reset of high-deductible commercial insurance plans.     Manufacturing of Our Products
     We have sourced and qualified third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the commercial supply of our products. The regulations for manufacturing of approved drug products are significantly more stringent than the standards for manufacturing supplements or drug product for clinical trials. Our CMOs are responsible for the manufacture of our products in accordance with our specifications and applicable regulatory requirements. We have entered into long-term supply agreements with Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC, or Catalent, for the commercial supply of our IMVEXXY® and BIJUVA™, and QPharma for the supply of ANNOVERA™. Under the terms of the agreements, we are obligated to purchase certain minimum annual amounts of each product. We may terminate the agreement for a particular drug for certain specified reasons. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of drugs or receive raw materials in a timely manner, we could be required to delay our manufacturing and seek alternative manufacturers, which would be costly and time-consuming.
     We have a multi-faceted risk management approach to ensure continuous supply from our qualified CMOs for the commercial supply of our products. This approach includes oversight of the manufacturing processes, regular GMP audits, a review of their business continuity plans, management of finished product inventory and safety stock, and second sourcing as appropriate.
     We have also sourced and qualified manufacturers of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or APIs, to be used in our drugs and drug candidates. We follow a risk management approach for our API manufacturer similar to that followed for the commercial supply of the finished drug product.
     We use third-party manufacturers to manufacture and package our vitamin and supplement products, as well as meet applicable contract and regulatory requirements. We currently obtain all of our vitaMedMD and BocaGreen products from Lang Pharma Nutrition, or Lang, a full-service, private label and corporate brand manufacturer specializing in premium health benefit driven products, including medical foods, nutritional supplements, beverages, bars, and functional foods in the dietary supplement category. As a result, we are dependent on Lang and its subcontractors for the manufacture of our vitamin and supplement products. In addition to manufacturing, Lang also provides a variety of additional services to us, including development processes, prototype development, raw materials sourcing, regulatory review, and packaging production. We believe that Lang maintains multiple supply and purchasing relationships throughout the raw materials marketplace to provide an uninterrupted supply of product to meet our manufacturing requirements.
     We have experienced no difficulties in obtaining the vitamin and supplement products we need in the amounts we require and do not anticipate those issues in the future. We believe the terms of our agreements with Lang are competitive with other suppliers and manufacturers. At present, we believe our relationship with Lang is excellent, and we intend to continue to use Lang as our third-party manufacturer for most of our vitamins and supplements. Although we anticipate continuing our relationship with Lang, we believe that we could obtain similar terms with other suppliers to provide the same services in the event our relationship with Lang terminates. Accordingly, we do not believe that such termination would have a material adverse effect on our business.
     Quality Control for our Products
     Our products are required to be manufactured in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMPs. Our third-party suppliers and manufacturers are responsible for continued compliance with cGMP requirements. We have executed Quality Agreements that delineate the responsibilities of each company in the quality assurance process. To comply with these drug commercialization standards, we have personnel with pharmaceutical development, manufacturing, and quality assurance experience who are responsible for the relationships with our suppliers. We have contracted with Catalent, an established manufacturer of softgel drug products, to manufacture the commercial supply for both IMVEXXY® and BIJUVA™. In 2018, the Catalent facility that manufactures IMVEXXY® and BIJUVA™ received FDA Form 483 observations from an FDA inspection. For our vitaTrue product, a subcontractor to Lang received FDA Form 483 observations from an FDA inspection during 2018. Neither of these investigations were specific to our products. We have contracted with QPharma to manufacture the commercial supply for ANNOVERA™. Although QPharma has received FDA Form 483 observations from FDA inspections in the past, we are not aware of any open FDA investigations into its manufacturing processes at the facilities that would be used to manufacture our products.
       17 
 
     Our quality assurance team establishes controls that are designed to document the manufacturing process and ensure that our contract manufacturers meet product specifications and that our finished products contain the correct ingredients, purity, strength, and composition in compliance with FDA regulations. Our contractors test incoming raw materials and finished goods to ensure they meet or exceed FDA and U.S. Pharmacopeia standards (when applicable), including quantitative and qualitative assay and microbial and heavy metal contamination (as appropriate).
     Distribution of our Products
     We distribute our products through our third-party logistics partner, Cardinal Logistics who ship to national wholesaler distributors such as Cardinal, McKesson, and AmerisourceBergen, regional wholesalers such as Smith Drug, Anda, Value Drug and RDC and alternate distribution partners. Wholesaler product inventory is monitored daily and sales out is monitored weekly. National and regional retail pharmacies are also an area of focus to make sure our products are purchased and dispensed properly.
     Customer Service
     Our goal is 100% customer satisfaction by consistently delivering superior customer experiences before, during, and after the sale. To achieve this goal, we maintain a fully-staffed customer care center that uses current customer relationship management software to respond to HCPs, pharmacies, and consumers. We believe our customer service initiatives allow us to establish and maintain long-term customer relationships and facilitate repeat visits and purchases.
     Our representatives receive regular training so that they can effectively and efficiently field questions from current and prospective customers and are also trained not to answer questions that should be directed to a customer’s physician. Having a quality customer care center allows our representatives to provide an array of valuable data in the areas of sales, market research, quality assurance, lead generation, and customer retention.
     Our Return Policy
     We sell our prescription products through third-party logistics providers, wholesale distributors, and retail pharmacy distributors, all of whom may return a product within six months before and twelve months after the expiration date of the product. Once customers buy a prescription product from the pharmacy, the product may not be returned.     Our Quality Guarantee
     We proudly stand behind the quality of our products. We believe our guarantee makes it easy, convenient, and safe for customers to purchase our products. Under our quality guarantee, we:
● | ensure the potency and quality of our products; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | help HCPs and payers by delivering information on patient compliance and satisfaction.

 
 We value frequent communication with and feedback from our customers to continue to improve our offerings and services.
     Research and Development
     Our product development programs are concentrated in advanced hormone therapy pharmaceutical products. We engage in programs to provide alternatives to the FDA and non-FDA-approved compounded bio-identical market for hormone therapy. Our programs seek to bring new products to market in unique delivery systems or formats that enhance the effectiveness, safety, and reliability of existing hormone therapy alternatives.
     Our research and development expenses were approximately $27.3 million in 2018, $33.9 million in 2017, and $53.9 million in 2016.
     Intellectual Property
     Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade-secret protection, and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our intellectual property portfolio is one way we attempt to protect our competitive position. We rely primarily on a combination of know-how, trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and contractual restrictions to protect our products and to maintain our competitive position. We are diligently seeking ways to protect our intellectual property through various legal mechanisms in relevant jurisdictions.
       18 
 
     As of December 31, 2018, we had 21 issued domestic or U.S. patents and 24 issued foreign patents, including:
    
● | 11 domestic patents and five foreign patents that relate to BIJUVA™ as well as three domestic patents that relate to non-approved doses of BIJUVA™. These patents establish an important intellectual property foundation for BIJUVA™ and are owned by us. The domestic patents will expire in 2032. The foreign patents will expire no earlier than 2032. In addition, we have pending patent applications relating to BIJUVA™ in the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Three foreign patents that relate to our progesterone-only candidate, which are owned by us. The foreign patents will expire no earlier than 2033. In addition, we have pending patent applications with respect to our progesterone-only candidate in the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea; 
● | Three domestic patents (two utility and one design) and 12 foreign patents (three utility and nine design) that relate to IMVEXXY®. These patents establish an important intellectual property foundation for IMVEXXY® and are owned by us. The domestic patents will expire in 2032 or 2033. The foreign utility patents will expire no earlier than 2033. The foreign design patents provide protection expiring no earlier than 2025. In certain jurisdictions, the foreign design patents provide protection through at least 2037. In addition, we have pending patent applications related to IMVEXXY® in the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea;
● | One domestic utility patent that relates to our topical-cream candidates, which is owned by us. The domestic patent will expire in 2035. We have pending patent applications with respect to our topical-cream candidates in the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea; 
● | One domestic utility patent and four foreign patents that relate to our transdermal-patch candidates, which are owned by us. The domestic utility patent will expire in 2032. The foreign patents will expire no earlier than 2033. We have pending patent applications with respect to our transdermal-patch candidates in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Mexico, Japan, and South Africa; 
● | One domestic utility patent that relates to our OPERA® information-technology platform, which is owned by us and will expire in 2029; and 
● | One domestic utility patent that relates to TX-009HR, a progesterone and estradiol product candidate, which is owned by us and will expire in 2037. We have pending patent applications with respect to TX-009HR in the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea. 

 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had filed over 107 patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, with respect to our technology or our hormone-therapy drugs and drug candidates, and over 162 international patent applications with respect to our technology or our hormone-therapy drugs and drug candidates, including Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and national-stage filings.
     We hold multiple U.S. trademark registrations and have numerous pending trademark applications. Issuance of a federally registered trademark creates a rebuttable presumption of ownership of the mark; however, it is subject to challenge by others claiming first use in the mark in some or all the areas in which it is used. Federally registered trademarks have a perpetual life so long as they are maintained and renewed on a timely basis and used properly as trademarks, subject to the rights of third parties to seek cancellation of the trademarks if they claim priority or confusion of usage. We believe our patents and trademarks are valuable and provide us certain benefits in marketing our products.
     We intend to actively protect our intellectual property with patents, trademarks, trade secrets, or other legal avenues for the protection of intellectual property and to aggressively prosecute, enforce, and defend our patents, trademarks, and proprietary technology. The loss, by expiration or otherwise, of any one patent may have a material effect on our business. Defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be expensive and time consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that the patents issued or licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a court may find that we are infringing on validly issued patents of third parties, or that we may have to alter or discontinue the development of our products or pay licensing fees to account for patent rights of third parties.
     OPERA® is our patented information technology platform used in our business. We believe the deployment of OPERA® and the further development and deployment of related technology creates a sustainable competitive advantage in clinical development and product improvement.
       19 
 
     As we continue to develop proprietary intellectual property, we will expand our protection by applying for patents on future technologies. As we examine our current product offerings and new product pipeline, we are in the process of modifying and developing new formulations that will enable us to gain patent protection for these products.
     While we seek broad coverage under our patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the process may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, patents expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending application or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property.
     Government Regulation
     In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and cosmetics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. These products are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations, including federal and state consumer protection laws, laws protecting the privacy of health-related information, and laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts and trade practices.     Pharmaceutical Regulation
     The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
    
● | completion of or reference to extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an IND application under which the holder may begin conducting human clinical trials, provided that the FDA does not object; the IND must be updated annually; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication; and 
● | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials. 

 
 An IND application is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. We have submitted six INDs for our hormone therapy drug candidates, including an IND for TX-009HR in 2018. The INDs for TX-002HR and TX-003HR are currently on inactive status. The INDs for TX-004HR, TX-001HR, TX-006HR, and TX-009HR remain active.
     Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in the clinical trial. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed and re-assess and approve the study at least annually. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
     Clinical trials are usually conducted in three phases. Phase 1 clinical trials are normally conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers to assess safety, characterize pharmacokinetics, and assist in finding the potential dosing range. After phase 1, the drug is administered to small populations of patients (phase 2) to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease or condition and to continue to assess dosing and safety. Phase 3 clinical trials are usually multi-center, double-blind, controlled trials in hundreds or even thousands of subjects at various sites to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug.
     During a clinical trial, we are required to inform the FDA and the IRB about adverse events associated with our drug candidate. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group reviews unblinded data from clinical trials and provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climates.
     Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things.
       20 
 
     Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within 10 months of filing or 12 months of receipt for a new molecular entity. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.
     Since regulatory approval of some of our drug products has been obtained, we are required to comply with several post-approval requirements. As a holder of an approved NDA, we are required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP to ensure and preserve the long-term stability of the drug product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive, and record keeping requirements. For example, Catalent, the CMO that we have contracted with for the commercial supply of our BIJUVA™ and IMVEXXY® hormone therapy drug products, was issued a Form FDA-483 in 2018 with respect to its softgel manufacturing plant. The observations and associated corrective actions identified in Catalent’s response to the Form FDA 483 do not relate specifically to our products. The current status of that Form FDA 483 is No Action Indicated. No Action Indicated status indicates that the FDA is satisfied with Catalent’s responses and proposed corrective measures to the observations and that no further regulatory action is needed following Catalent’s responses.
     After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, we would be required to comply with several post-approval requirements. As a holder of an approved NDA, we would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to ensure and preserve the long-term stability of the drug product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive, and record keeping requirements.
     In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
     We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to produce clinical and commercial quantities of our drugs and drug candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
     Our hormone therapy drugs and drug candidates may compete with unapproved hormone therapy products supplied by compounding pharmacies. Pharmacy compounding is a practice in which a licensed pharmacist combines, mixes, or alters ingredients in response to a prescription to create a medication tailored to the medical needs of an individual patient. The medications created by the compounding pharmacy are theoretically “new drugs” that would otherwise be subject to the new drug approval requirements of the FDCA.
     However, for approximately 50 years, the FDA left regulation of compounding pharmacies to the states. In 1992, in response to various safety concerns, the FDA issued a Compliance Policy Guide, which announced that the “FDA may, in the exercise of its enforcement discretion, initiate federal enforcement actions...when the scope and nature of a pharmacy’s activities raises the kinds of concerns normally associated with a manufacturer and...results in significant violations of the new drug, adulteration, or misbranding provisions of the Act.” Thereafter, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, or FDAMA, which sought to clarify FDA’s regulatory authority over compounding pharmacies. FDAMA exempted “compounded drugs” from the FDA’s standard drug approval requirements as long as the providers of those drugs abide by several restrictions, including that they refrain from advertising or promoting particular compounded drugs. In 2002, though, the Supreme Court declared this provision of FDAMA to be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, effectively re-instating the pre-FDAMA regime. Shortly thereafter, the FDA issued its 2002 Compliance Policy Guide 460.200, which states that the FDA will exercise enforcement discretion to exclude compounded drugs from the new drug approval requirements except where compounding pharmacies act more akin to traditional drug manufacturers.
       21 
 
     To further clarify the FDA’s jurisdiction, Congress enacted and the President signed into law the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, which among other things, formalized the relationship between the FDA and compounding pharmacies by exempting compounding pharmacy products from the FDA approval requirements and the requirement to label products with adequate directions for use, but not the exemption from cGMP requirements. To qualify for this exemption, a compounding pharmacy must register with the FDA as an “outsourcing facility,” subject to FDA inspection and other requirements. The FDA does not exercise the same authority to regulate compounding pharmacies as pharmaceutical manufacturers. For example, compounding pharmacies are not required to report adverse events associated with compounded drugs, while commercial drug manufacturers are subject to stringent regulatory reporting requirements.
     New Drug Applications
     We received marketing approval for three NDAs in 2018, two for our hormone therapy drug products, IMVEXXY® and BIJUVA™, and one for our in-licensed contraceptive drug ANNOVERA™. Where permitted, patents for our hormone therapy drug products have been submitted to the Orange Book.     Regulatory Exclusivity
     A Section 505(b) NDA applicant may be eligible for its own regulatory exclusivity period, such as a five-year or three-year exclusivity. The first approved Section 505(b) NDA applicant for a drug containing a new chemical entity, or NCE, is entitled to a five-year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity period. During this period, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application cannot be submitted to FDA until the end of the five-year exclusivity period (or at year four if the product is covered by an Orange Book listed patent). Additional exclusivities may also apply.
     The first approved Section 505(b) NDA applicant for a particular condition, or change to a marketed product, such as a new extended release formulation for a previously approved product, may be granted three-year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity if one or more clinical studies, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from making effective any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the same condition of use or for a change to the marketing product that was granted exclusivity until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. Additional exclusivities may also apply.
     Additionally, the Section 505(b) NDA applicant may have relevant patents in the Orange Book, and if it does, it can initiate patent infringement litigation against those applicants that challenge such patents, which could result in a 30-month stay delaying FDA’s approval of ANDA applications further.
     Dietary Supplement Regulation
     Our currently marketed prenatal vitamins are regulated as dietary supplements. The processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of these products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, and by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold.
     Generally, our nutritional product formulations are proprietary in that in designing them, we attempt to blend an optimal combination of nutrients that appear to have beneficial impact based upon scientific literature and input from physicians; however, we are generally prohibited from making disease treatment and prevention claims in the promotion of our products that use these formulations.
     The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, or DSHEA, amended the FDCA to establish a new framework governing the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing, and marketing of dietary supplements. Generally, under the FDCA, dietary ingredients that were marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. “New” dietary ingredients (i.e., dietary ingredients that were “not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994”) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been “present in the food supply as an article used for food” without being “chemically altered.” A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA evidence of a “history of use or other evidence of safety” establishing that use of the dietary ingredient “will reasonably be expected to be safe.” A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the new dietary ingredient. The FDA may determine that a new dietary ingredient notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe. Such a determination could prevent the marketing of such dietary ingredient. The FDA recently issued draft guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients. FDA guidance is not mandatory and companies are free to use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. However, FDA guidance is a strong indication of the FDA’s “current thinking” on the topic discussed in the guidance, including its position on enforcement. The draft guidance on new dietary ingredients is expected to be significantly revised when published in final form. Moreover, Congress can amend the dietary supplement provisions of the FDCA to impose additional restrictions on labeling and marketing of dietary supplements. Such action would have material adverse impact on our business and growth prospects.
       22 
 
     The FDA or other agencies could take actions against products or product ingredients that in its determination present an unreasonable health risk to consumers that would make it illegal for us to sell such products. In addition, the FDA could issue consumer warnings with respect to the products or ingredients in such products. Such actions or warnings could be based on information received through FDCA-mandated reporting of serious adverse events. The FDCA requires that reports of serious adverse events be submitted to the FDA, and based in part on such reports, the FDA has issued public warnings to consumers to stop using certain third-party dietary supplement products.
     The FDCA permits “statements of nutritional support” to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without premarket approval. Such statements must be submitted to the FDA within 30 days of marketing. Such statements may describe how a particular dietary ingredient affects the structure, function, or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect body structure, function, or well-being, but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease. A company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess scientific evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If the FDA determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim, conventional food claim, or an unauthorized version of a “health claim,” or, if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific data or is false or misleading, we would be prevented from using the claim.
     In addition, DSHEA provides that so-called “third-party literature,” such as a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication linking a particular dietary ingredient with health benefits, may be used “in connection with the sale of a dietary supplement to consumers” without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. The literature: (1) must not be false or misleading; (2) may not “promote” a particular manufacturer or brand dietary supplement; (3) must present a balanced view of the available scientific information on the subject matter; (4) if displayed in establishment, must be physically separate from the dietary supplements; and (5) should not have appended to it any information by sticker or another method. If the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements, we may be prevented from disseminating such literature with our products, and any dissemination could subject our product to regulatory action as an illegal drug.
     In June 2007, pursuant to the authority granted by the FDCA as amended by DSHEA, the FDA published detailed cGMP regulations that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers. The cGMP regulations, among other things, impose significant recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers. The cGMP requirements are in effect for all manufacturers, and the FDA is conducting inspections of dietary supplement manufacturers pursuant to these requirements. The failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cGMP regulations renders products manufactured in such facility “adulterated,” and subjects such products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential FDA enforcement actions. In addition, under the Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA, which was enacted on January 2, 2011, the manufacturing of dietary ingredients contained in dietary supplements are subject to similar or even more burdensome manufacturing requirements, which has the potential to increase the costs of dietary ingredients and subject suppliers of such ingredients to more rigorous inspections and enforcement. The FSMA also requires importers of food, including dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, to conduct verification activities to ensure that the food they might import meets applicable domestic requirements.
     The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal law applicable to dietary supplements, including powers to issue public Warning Letters or Untitled Letters to a company, publicize information about illegal products, detain products intended for import, require the reporting of serious adverse events, request a recall of illegal or unsafe products from the market, and request that the Department of Justice initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in the U.S. courts. The FSMA expands the reach and regulatory powers of the FDA with respect to the production and importation of food, including dietary supplements. The expanded reach and regulatory powers include the FDA’s ability to order mandatory recalls, administratively detain domestic products, require certification of compliance with domestic requirements for imported foods associated with safety issues and administratively revoke manufacturing facility registrations, effectively enjoining manufacturing of dietary ingredients and dietary supplements without judicial process. The regulation of dietary supplements may increase or become more restrictive in the future.
     The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements and cosmetics. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for making false or misleading advertising claims and for failing to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising. These enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties and/or restitution by the companies involved. The FTC also regulates other aspects of consumer purchases, including promotional offers of savings compared policies, telemarketing, continuity plans, and “free” offers.
       23 
 
     We are also subject to regulation under various state, local, and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of dietary supplements and drugs. For example, Proposition 65 in the state of California is a list of substances deemed to pose a risk of carcinogenicity or birth defects at or above certain levels. If any such ingredient exceeds the permissible levels in a dietary supplement, cosmetic, or drug, the product may be lawfully sold in California only if accompanied by a prominent warning label alerting consumers that the product contains an ingredient linked to cancer or birth defect risk. Private attorney general actions as well as California attorney general actions may be brought against non-compliant parties and can result in substantial costs and fines.
     Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
     We are also subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
● | The federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, and its corresponding regulations, prohibit physicians from referring patients for designated health services, including outpatient drugs, reimbursed under the Medicare or Medicaid programs to entities with which the physicians or their immediate family members have a financial relationship or an ownership interest, subject to narrow regulatory exceptions, and prohibits those entities from submitting claims to Medicare or Medicaid for payment of items or services provided to a referred beneficiary.
● | The federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, and authorizes civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment involving federally funded programs that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money with respect to a federal program. 
● | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
● | The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with any mater within the jurisdiction of the federal government, including the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. 
● | Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payers, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. 

 
 Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could be costly. Although we believe that our business practices are structured to be compliant with applicable laws, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our past or present operations, including activities conducted by our sales team or agents, are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from third party payer programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians, providers, or entities with whom we do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from government funded healthcare programs.
     Many aspects of these laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations that increases the risk of potential violations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business, and damage our reputation.
     In addition, from time to time in the future, we may become subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA, the FTC, or by other federal, state, local, or foreign regulatory authorities, to the repeal of laws or regulations that we generally consider favorable, such as DSHEA, or to more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. We are not able to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, repeals, or interpretations, and we cannot predict what effect additional governmental regulation, if and when it occurs, would have on our business in the future. Such developments could, however, require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, additional personnel, or other new requirements. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.

     The growth and demand for eCommerce could result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online retailers. These consumer protection laws could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business. There is currently great uncertainty in many states whether or how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, and libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and commercial online retailers. These issues may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in several states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or a change in application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes on our business. These taxes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we had 241 employees, six of whom are executive officers. Additionally, from time to time, we hire temporary contract employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we are unaware of any union organizing efforts. We have never experienced a major work stoppage, strike, or dispute. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.     Our History
     On October 3, 2011, we changed our name to TherapeuticsMD, Inc. On October 4, 2011, we closed a reverse merger with VitaMedMD pursuant to which (1) all outstanding membership units of VitaMedMD were exchanged for shares of our common stock, (2) all outstanding VitaMedMD options and warrants were exchanged and converted into options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, and (3) VitaMedMD became our wholly owned subsidiary. As of December 31, 2011, we determined that VitaMedMD would become the sole focus of our company and services previously performed relative to the licensing agreement discussed in the following paragraph were discontinued.
     We were incorporated in Utah in 1907 under the name Croff Mining Company, or Croff. Prior to 2008, Croff’s operations consisted entirely of oil and natural gas leases. Due to a spin-off of its operations in December 2007, Croff had no business operations or revenue source and had reduced its operations to a minimal level although it continued to file reports required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. As a result of the spin-off, Croff was a “shell company” under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. In July 2009, Croff (i) closed a transaction to acquire America’s Minority Health Network, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary, (ii) ceased being a shell company, and (iii) experienced a change in control in which the former stockholders of America’s Minority Health Network, Inc. acquired control of our company. On June 11, 2010, we closed a transaction to acquire Spectrum Health Network, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary. On July 20, 2010, we filed Articles of Conversion and Articles of Incorporation to redomicile in the state of Nevada. On July 31, 2010, we transferred the assets of America’s Minority Health Network, Inc. to a secured noteholder in exchange for the satisfaction of certain associated debt. On February 15, 2011, we transferred the assets of Spectrum Health Network, Inc. to a secured noteholder in exchange for the satisfaction of associated debt and in exchange for a licensing agreement under which we subsequently sold subscription services and advertising on the Spectrum Health Network for commissions.
