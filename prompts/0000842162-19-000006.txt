Key trends that specifically affect our business include automotive manufacturers’ utilization of global vehicle platforms, increasing demand for luxury and performance features, including increasing levels of electrical and electronic content, and China’s emergence as the single largest major automotive market in the world with above average long-term growth expectations. 
Another key trend benefiting our business is the shift toward crossover and sport utility vehicles. Our content on such vehicles, especially those for which our Seating segment supplies products, can be significantly higher than our average content per vehicle. Crossover and sport utility vehicle production has grown to approximately 36% of total vehicle production in 2018, up from 20% of total vehicle production five years ago. China has been a major driver of this trend, where crossover and sport 
5

utility vehicle production now comprises approximately 41% of total vehicle production, up from 16% of total vehicle production five years ago.
Our strategy is built on addressing these trends and the major imperatives for success as an automotive supplier: quality, cost and efficiency and innovation and technology. We have expanded key component and software capabilities through organic investment and acquisitions to ensure a full complement of the best solutions for our customers. We have restructured, and continue to align, our manufacturing and engineering footprint to attain a leading competitive cost position globally. We have established or expanded activities in new and growing markets, especially China, in support of our customers’ growth and global platform initiatives. These initiatives have helped us achieve our financial goals overall, as well as a more balanced regional, customer and vehicle segment diversification in our business.
In addition, we believe that demand for efficiency, connectivity and safety are driving the technology trends of autonomy, connectivity and electrification. These trends, along with the trend toward shared mobility, are likely to be at the forefront of our industry for the foreseeable future with each converging long-term toward fully autonomous, connected, electric or hybrid electric vehicles:

• | Autonomy/Advanced Driver Assistance - Customer and consumer demands are evolving from safety features and systems that protect vehicle occupants when a crash occurs to advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that help prevent crashes by assisting in the vehicle’s operation under certain conditions. The development of automated intervention uses many of the same core technologies that will enable vehicles to drive autonomously under an increasing variety of driving conditions.


• | Connectivity - Customer and consumer demands for constant communication and information exchange with the vehicle continue to increase. What began with consumer demand to extend and integrate mobile connectivity into the vehicle by connecting mobile devices with vehicle infotainment systems is evolving such that the vehicle itself will have an embedded, direct line of wireless communication connecting the vehicle with various networks (e.g., cellular, infrastructure, satellite, etc.) and other vehicles. We expect these trends to continue, making the vehicle a constantly connected device, receiving and transmitting data through a variety of signals, which communicate directly with on-board vehicle systems.


• | Electrification - Demand for more energy efficient vehicles is increasing, both from customers to meet stricter fuel economy and emissions standards and from a growing segment of consumers to reduce the environmental impact of automobiles. This requires further use of electronically controlled and assisted powertrains and related components to improve fuel efficiency and the adoption of alternative energy powertrains, such as 48-volt mild hybrid, full hybrid, hybrid electric and high power battery electric, that facilitate electrification of the vehicle, as well as the use of lighter weight materials throughout the vehicle.


• | Shared Mobility - As vehicle utilization increases, customer and consumer demands for an improved experience in the mobility space are also increasing and services are becoming more relevant.

These trends are becoming widely accepted and are also attracting new, non-traditional participants in the automotive industry that are leveraging technology, vehicle electrification and consumer relationships to exploit growth opportunities in the industry. Regulation is also a major influence on these trends, as government mandates (e.g., for vehicles to meet minimum fuel economy and emissions standards or be equipped with certain safety-related components) are driving vehicle design and technology plans.
We are well positioned for growth by capitalizing on these trends as we supply high value systems and components that drive critical functionality and core elements of the vehicle’s electrical architecture and design. The systems and components that we design, develop and manufacture facilitate and support more fuel efficient or fully electrically-powered alternative powertrains, facilitate connectivity of various vehicle systems, and impact a vehicle’s safety, crashworthiness and readiness for autonomous driving systems. Many of our systems and components also directly impact the consumer, providing us with the opportunity to offer our automotive customers technology, solutions and designs that will differentiate their vehicles in the consumer marketplace. 
We are well positioned to directly participate in the connectivity trend as we design, develop and supply systems, components and software that connect the various electrical and electronic systems within the vehicle into integrated on-board power and data communication networks. We further have the technology and expertise to wirelessly and securely connect these on-board vehicle networks and systems with external networks over various standards and protocols. This expertise allows us to offer our automotive customers electronic modules, such as connected gateway modules, that offer functionality such as over-the-air software updates or cellular communication of vehicle performance data to the automotive manufacturers, their dealers or the vehicle owners. Our expertise in V2X technology allows us to provide in-vehicle and roadside modules and software that facilitate direct, high-speed communication between vehicles and road infrastructure. Importantly, we have expertise in cybersecurity, including architectures, designs and techniques that promote highly secure transmission of data to, from and 
6

within the vehicle, as well as road infrastructure. Our capabilities in V2X communications and applications position us to provide high speed communication between vehicles, even in extreme weather conditions, potentially reducing crashes through real-time advisories alerting drivers to imminent hazards in the roadway ahead, including other vehicles on a potential path for collision.
Furthermore, a seat is an active part of the vehicle safety system. As a result of our innovative product design and technology capabilities, we are able to provide seats with enhanced safety features, such as the active head restraint and seat structures that withstand collision impact in excess of what is demanded by regulatory agencies. We have developed products and materials to reduce cost and enhance seat design and packaging flexibility, including our mini recliners and micro adjust tracks. Another way in which we are well positioned to benefit from this trend-related growth is our belief that the seat system will become increasingly more sophisticated, dynamic and connected to both the occupants and the vehicle. The seat is the logical focal point for monitoring the driver and passenger and for facilitating feedback between the vehicle and the occupants. 
Continued growth in more fuel efficient, complex and electronically controlled powertrains is helping to drive content growth in the vehicle's electrical distribution system. The emergence and continued development of alternative energy powertrains, including electric, hybrid electric, 48-volt mild hybrid and other technologies, is driving growth in high power electric systems and components. Hybrid and electric vehicles incorporate both high power and low power components. As a result, they offer a significant incremental content opportunity for us of up to $2,000 per vehicle for full electric vehicle architectures. These trends all support continued growth in electrical and electronic content on the vehicle, as well as associated software. This content growth will require far more complex vehicle electrical architectures. Our significant experience designing and manufacturing highly integrated and standardized architectures that optimize size, performance and quality leaves us well positioned to take advantage of the growth in electrical content and the increasingly complex architectures. 
We believe that the convergence of these technology trends and eventual wide-spread adoption of autonomous vehicles will benefit both our Seating and E-Systems segments. We believe that autonomous vehicles will have seat designs and requirements that are far more flexible and demanding in both autonomous and piloted driving states. Further, more active monitoring of the driver and the driver’s position and physical state will be required to manage the transitions between autonomous and piloted driving conditions. A demand for mobility services and on-demand transportation from providers such as Uber or Lyft is helping to drive interest and growth in these technology trends, particularly fully autonomous vehicles. The increasing prevalence of mobility services will potentially create a new segment of autonomous vehicle fleet customers with unique vehicle technology and design needs, including more flexible, durable and connected seating solutions for a wide range of passengers. Not only will autonomous vehicles need to be fully connected and networked to maximize their safety and efficiency, their power consumption will be significantly higher to support the array of sensors and processing power required to operate such vehicles.

Wire harness assemblies are a collection of wiring and terminals and connectors that link all of the various electrical and electronic devices within the vehicle to each other and/or to a power source. Wire harness assemblies are a collection of individual circuits fabricated from raw and insulated wire, which is automatically cut to length and terminated during the manufacturing process. Individual circuits are assembled together on a jig or table, inserted into connectors and wrapped or taped to form wire harness assemblies. The assembly process is labor intensive, and as a result, production is generally performed in low-cost labor sites in Mexico, Honduras, Brazil, Eastern Europe, Africa, China, the Philippines and Thailand. 
Terminals and connectors include conductive metal components and connector housings that join wire harness assemblies together at their respective end points or connect devices to wire harness assemblies. Terminals and connectors can vary significantly in size and complexity depending on the amount of power or data being transferred and the number of connections being made at any particular point in the electrical distribution system. Terminals and connectors are currently manufactured in Germany, Eastern Europe, China and the United States. 
Junction boxes are centrally located modules within the vehicle that contain fuses and/or relays for circuit and device protection and serve as a connection point for multiple wire harnesses. Junction boxes are manufactured in Mexico, Europe, Northern Africa, China and the Philippines with a proprietary, capital-intensive assembly process using printed circuit boards, a portion of which are purchased from third-party suppliers. Certain materials, particularly certain specialized electronic components, are available from a limited number of suppliers. Proprietary features have been developed to improve the function of these junction boxes in harsh environments, including extreme temperatures and humidity.

Our electronic modules include body control modules, smart junction boxes, gateway modules, wireless control modules, lighting control modules and audio domain controllers and amplifiers. Our engineering and development activities for electronics are in the United States (Southfield, Michigan and Northern California), Belgium, Germany, Spain, China and India. We assemble these modules using high-speed surface mount placement equipment in Mexico, Europe, Northern Africa, China and the Philippines.
Body control modules primarily control vehicle interior functions outside of the vehicle’s head unit or infotainment system. Depending on the vehicle’s electrical and electronic architecture, these modules can be either highly integrated, consolidating multiple functional controls into a single module, or focus on a specific function, such as seat position and comfort controls or the door zone control module which controls features such as window lift, door lock and power mirrors. As electronic control modules became increasingly centralized and integrated, we developed "smart junction boxes," which are junction boxes augmented with integrated electronic functionality that otherwise would be contained in other body control modules. The integration of functionality in our smart junction boxes eliminates interconnections, increases overall system reliability and can consolidate the number of electronic modules within the vehicle. This can lead to reduced cost and complexity. We believe that our expertise in consolidating functional controls into integrated modules and integrating these modules into the vehicle’s electrical and electronic architecture is a competitive strength.

We develop and produce gateway modules, which facilitate secure access to, and communication with, all of the vehicle systems at a central point and translate various signals to facilitate data exchange across various vehicle domains. This gateway becomes increasingly important as formerly distinct vehicle systems increasingly must work in concert with one another. We also offer wireless functionality in both integrated and stand-alone modules, which send and receive signals using radio frequency technology. Our wireless systems include passive entry systems, remote keyless entry and dual range/dual function remote keyless entry systems. We are building on both our core gateway and wireless capabilities as we add and develop higher levels of data and signal connectivity in and out of the vehicle.
Our electronics product offerings also include lighting control modules, which provide the electronic control logic and diagnostics for increasingly advanced and complex vehicle lighting systems, including advanced driver assistance-integrated lighting solutions utilizing advanced LED matrix beam technology. We supply LED lighting control systems for vehicle interiors and exteriors. In addition, we offer audio electronics, including premium audio amplifiers and complete vehicle sound system development capabilities with advanced domain control and audio tuning.
The higher level of complexity and processing power in these electronic control modules is driving rapid increases in software requirements associated with these modules. Accordingly, we continue to build on our knowledge and capabilities in software in order to design and develop more complex and integrated electronic control modules capable of more efficiently managing the distribution of power and data signals through the vehicle. 
Connectivity
We are building connectivity capabilities that facilitate secure, wireless communication between the vehicle’s systems and external networks, as well as other vehicles. Our connectivity strategy is based on leveraging our expertise in vehicle electrical and electronic architecture design and development, electronic module functional integration, gateway module data exchange and core wireless signals. We are building capabilities organically through internal investment and through acquisition and partnership. Recent transactions added technology that directly connects on-board vehicle systems with cloud-based applications using proprietary, secure data exchange capabilities via cellular networks and V2X hardware and software solutions utilizing various wireless communications protocols, as well as vehicle positioning through GNSS satellite communications. This includes the development of differentiated GPS technology, which provides high-accuracy positioning solutions for autonomous and connected vehicle applications.
These capabilities, combined with our vehicle electrical and electronic architecture expertise and products, allow us to offer our customers embedded modules and software that facilitate direct and secure connectivity between the vehicle and external networks. Products that we can offer will include connected gateway modules with an array of features including over-the-air software update capabilities, embedded cellular communication modules, e-Call modules that automatically contact emergency services in the event of a crash and both on-board and roadside units that facilitate V2X communications. We combine these offerings with cybersecurity expertise and software solutions to permit highly secure communications and defend against cybersecurity attacks. Our expertise in both core body controls and connectivity allows us to offer "Virtual CarKey" capabilities that securely enable vehicle access via a smartphone.

In electrical distribution systems, our technology includes expertise in the design and use of alternative conductor materials, such as aluminum, copper-clad steel and other hybrid alloys. Alternative conductor materials can enable the use of ultra small gauge conductors, which reduce the weight and packaging size of electrical distribution systems. We also have developed proprietary manufacturing process technologies, such as our vertical manufacturing system that features three dimensional wire harness assembly boards. Our expertise in terminals and connectors technology facilitates our ability to implement these small gauge and alternative alloy conductors. We have developed advanced capabilities in aluminum terminals and aluminum wire termination, ultra small gauge termination, and high voltage terminals and connectors. We have developed high packaging density in-line connectors and new small gauge terminals that will enable wire gauge reduction and provide our customers with smaller and lower cost solutions. Our high voltage terminals and connectors are a part of our advanced efficiency systems capabilities, and we have established a leading capability in power density (power per packaging size) that is being adopted by multiple automakers. Our advanced efficiency systems and components for high voltage vehicle applications have achieved industry leading efficiency, packaging and reliability. We continue to build on our strong technology position for high voltage applications and have developed an 11kW wireless charging system that enables electric vehicles to safely recharge at the highest power level available without plugging in the vehicle. We have 650 patents issued or applied for in the advanced efficiency systems product technology area. These technologies are supported by our proprietary Virtual Proving Grounds, which is an industry-leading suite of in-house developed tools and processes to significantly reduce the design, development, and validation testing time and expense. 
In electronics, we are a market leader in smart junction box technology and began production of our Automotive News PACE Award winning Solid State Smart Junction Box™ in 2016. We continue to refine our smart junction box technology, including the development of aluminum printed circuit boards. We have developed body control modules with dual core microprocessors that allow body control and gateway functionality in a single module. We are a leader in gateway module technology and have capabilities to enable our gateway and other electronic control modules to efficiently and securely manage the increasing amount of both wired and wireless signals running throughout, as well as within and outside of, the vehicle, including being first-to-market with an ethernet-enabled gateway module. We also have developed wireless products, such as lower-cost passive entry systems with improved security using ultra wide band technology and that feature our 2-way remote keyless entry systems that enable the vehicle to provide feedback to the consumer, such as verification that the doors have locked or that the engine has started. In lighting, we have developed advanced technology electronic controls, including a Matrix LED Control System capable of individually dimming and switching on/off up to 100 LEDs. This system enables steerable light beams and other advanced lighting features and can be paired with driver assistance system sensors for functionality, such as automatic high beam management and obstacle highlighting.

We also have enhanced our V2X product line by adding secure, over-the-air software update capabilities to our V2X modules, allowing these units to receive regular software upgrades, which provide additional applications and functionality.
For additional factors that may impact our E-Systems segment’s business, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors."
Customers
In 2018, General Motors and Ford, two of the largest automotive and light truck manufacturers in the world, accounted for 18% and 16% of our net sales, respectively. We supply and have expertise in all vehicle segments of the automotive market. Our sales content tends to be higher on those vehicle platforms and segments which offer more features and functionality. The popularity of particular vehicle platforms and segments varies over time and by regional market. We expect to continue to win new business and grow sales at a greater rate than overall automotive industry production. For further information related to our customers and domestic and foreign sales and operations, see Note 13, "Segment Reporting," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Our customers award business to their suppliers in a number of ways, including the award of complete systems, which allows suppliers either to manufacture components internally or to purchase components from other suppliers at their discretion. Certain of our customers also elect to award certain components directly to component suppliers and independent of 
12

the award of the complete system. We have been selectively expanding our component capabilities and investing in manufacturing capacity in low-cost regions in order to maximize our participation in such component sourcing.
Our customers typically award contracts several years before actual production is scheduled to begin. Each year, the automotive manufacturers introduce new models, update existing models and discontinue certain models and, recently, even complete brands. In this process, we may be selected as the supplier on a new model, we may continue as the supplier on an updated model or we may lose a new or updated model to a competitor. Our sales backlog reflects estimated net sales over the next three years from formally awarded new programs, less lost and discontinued programs. This measure excludes the sales backlog at our non-consolidated joint ventures. As of January 2019, our 2019 to 2021 sales backlog is $3.35 billion, an increase of 5% as compared to our sales backlog as of January 2018. Our current sales backlog reflects $1.4 billion related to 2019 and 71% and 29% related to our Seating and E-Systems segments, respectively. In addition, our 2019 to 2021 sales backlog at our non-consolidated joint ventures is $500 million. Our current sales backlog assumes volumes based on the independent industry projections of IHS Automotive as of December 2018, a Euro exchange rate of $1.13/Euro and a Chinese RMB exchange rate of 6.95/$. This sales backlog is generally subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including vehicle production volumes on new and replacement programs and foreign exchange rates, as well as the timing of production launches and changes in customer development plans. For additional information regarding risks that may affect our sales backlog, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Part II — Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Forward-Looking Statements."
We receive purchase orders from our customers that generally provide for the supply of a customer’s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant, or in some cases, for the supply of a customer’s requirements for the life of a particular vehicle model, rather than for the purchase of a specified quantity of products. Although most purchase orders may be terminated by our customers at any time, such terminations have been minimal and have not had a material impact on our operating results. We are subject to risks that an automotive manufacturer will produce fewer units of a vehicle model than anticipated or that an automotive manufacturer will not award us a replacement program following the life of a vehicle model. To reduce our reliance on any one vehicle model, we produce automotive systems and components for a broad cross-section of both new and established models. However, larger cars and light trucks, as well as vehicle platforms that offer more features and functionality, such as luxury, sport utility and crossover vehicles, typically have more content and, therefore, tend to have a more significant impact on our operating performance. Our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, consisted of 40% passenger cars, 46% crossover and sport utility vehicles and 14% trucks and vans.
Our agreements with our major customers generally provide for an annual productivity price reduction. Historically, cost reductions through product design changes, increased manufacturing productivity and similar programs with our suppliers have generally offset these customer-imposed price reduction requirements. However, raw material, energy and commodity costs can be volatile. Although we have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material, energy and commodity costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers, typically offset only a portion of the adverse impact. Certain of these strategies also may limit our opportunities in a declining commodity environment. In addition, we are exposed to increasing market risk associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange as a result of our low-cost footprint and vertical integration strategies. We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. For additional information regarding our foreign exchange and commodity price risk, see Part II — Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Financial Condition — Foreign Exchange" and "— Commodity Prices."
Seasonality
Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for model year changeovers, in December when many customer plants close for the holidays and during periods of high vehicle inventory. See Note 15, "Quarterly Financial Data," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used in our seat systems, electrical distribution systems and electronics are generally available and obtained from multiple suppliers under various types of supply agreements. Components such as fabric, foam, leather, seat structures and mechanisms, terminals and connectors and certain other components are either manufactured by us internally or purchased from multiple suppliers under various types of supply agreements. The majority of the steel used in our products is comprised of fabricated components that are integrated into a seat system, such as seat frames, recliner mechanisms, seat tracks and other mechanical components. Therefore, our exposure to changes in steel prices is primarily indirect, through these purchased components. With the exception of certain terminals and connectors, the materials that we use to manufacture wire harness assemblies are substantially purchased from suppliers, including extruded and insulated wire and cable. The majority of our copper purchases are comprised of extruded wire and cable that we integrate into electrical wire harnesses. In general, our 
13

copper purchases, as well as a significant portion of our leather purchases, are subject to price index agreements with our customers. We utilize a combination of short-term and long-term supply contracts to purchase key components. We generally retain the right to terminate these agreements if our supplier does not remain competitive in terms of cost, quality, delivery, technology or customer support.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our employment levels worldwide were approximately as follows:

A substantial number of our employees are members of unions or national trade organizations. We have collective bargaining agreements with several North American unions, including the United Auto Workers, Unifor, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and Workers United. Each of our unionized facilities in the United States and Canada has a separate collective bargaining agreement with the union that represents the workers at such facility, with each such agreement having an expiration date that is independent of the other agreements. The majority of our employees in Mexico and Europe are members of industrial trade union organizations or confederations within their respective countries. Many of these organizations and confederations operate under national contracts, which are not specific to any one employer. We have occasionally experienced labor disputes at our plants. We have been able to resolve all such labor disputes and believe our relations with our employees are generally good.
See Item 1A, "Risk Factors — A significant labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could adversely affect our financial performance," and Part II — Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Forward-Looking Statements."
Intellectual Property
Worldwide, we have approximately 2,200 patents and patent applications pending. While we believe that our patent portfolio is a valuable asset, no individual patent or group of patents is critical to the success of our business. We also license selected technologies to automotive manufacturers and to other automotive suppliers. We continually strive to identify and implement new technologies for use in the design and development of our products.
Advanced technology development is conducted worldwide at our six advanced technology centers and at our product engineering centers. At these centers, we engineer our products to comply with applicable safety standards, meet quality and durability standards, respond to environmental conditions and conform to customer and consumer requirements. Our global innovation and technology center located in Southfield, Michigan, develops and integrates new concepts and is our central location for consumer research, benchmarking, craftsmanship and industrial design activity.

AVENTINO® leather, ConfigureE+TM, INTUTM Seating, LEAR CONNEXUSTM signal and data communications, PROACTIVE POSTURETM seating, ProTec® active head restraints, SMART JUNCTION BOXTM technology, STRUCSURETM systems and TeXstyleTM fabrics are some of our other trademarks used in connection with certain of our product lines.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to local, state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects. These laws, regulations and ordinances may impose liability for clean-up costs resulting from past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous wastes. For a description of our outstanding environmental matters and other legal proceedings, see Note 12, "Commitments and Contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
In addition, our customers are subject to significant environmentally focused state, federal and foreign laws and regulations that regulate vehicle emissions, fuel economy and other matters related to the environmental impact of vehicles. To the extent that 
14

such laws and regulations ultimately increase or decrease automotive vehicle production, such laws and regulations would likely impact our business. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors."
Furthermore, we currently offer products with environmentally friendly features, and our expertise and capabilities are allowing us to expand our product offerings in this area. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.
Joint Ventures and Noncontrolling Interests
We form joint ventures in order to gain entry into new markets, expand our product offerings and broaden our customer base. In particular, we believe that certain joint ventures have provided us, and will continue to provide us, with the opportunity to expand our business relationships with Asian automotive manufacturers, particularly in emerging markets. We also partner with companies having significant local experience in commerce and customs, as well as capacity, to reduce our financial risk and enhance our potential for achieving expected financial returns. In some cases, these joint ventures may be located in North America or Europe and used to expand our customer relationships.
As of December 31, 2018, we had sixteen operating joint ventures located in five countries. Of these joint ventures, eight are consolidated, and eight are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Twelve of the joint ventures operate in Asia, and four operate in North America (including two that are dedicated to serving Asian automotive manufacturers). Net sales of our consolidated joint ventures accounted for approximately 11% of our net sales in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our investments in non-consolidated joint ventures totaled $108 million.
