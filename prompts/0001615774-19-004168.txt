Recent Developments
 
We and the ethanol industry as a whole experienced significant adverse conditions throughout most of 2018 as a result of industry-wide record low ethanol prices due to reduced demand and high industry inventory levels. These factors resulted in prolonged negative operating margins, significantly lower cash flow from operations and substantial net losses. In response to these adverse conditions, we have initiated and expect to complete over the next six months a strategic realignment of our business. Our primary focus is the potential sale of certain production assets, a reduction of our debt levels, a strengthening of our cash and liquidity, and opportunities for strategic partnerships and capital raising activities, positioning us to optimize our business performance. We believe we have excellent production assets with values well in excess of our near term liquidity needs. We are also confident in our strong relationships with our financial and commercial partners and believe we are taking the appropriate steps to increase our shareholder value to benefit all of our stakeholders long-term and to provide greater financial flexibility to execute future strategic initiatives.
 
We believe our strategic realignment, if implemented timely and on suitable terms, will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated working capital, debt service and other liquidity needs through at least the next twelve months. However, if we are unable to timely implement our strategic realignment on suitable terms, if margins do not improve, or if we are unable to further defer principal and/or interest payments or extend the maturity date on our debt, we will likely have insufficient liquidity through the next twelve months, or earlier depending on margins, operating cash flows and lender forbearance. In addition, if margins do not improve from current levels, we may be forced to curtail our production at one or more of our operating facilities. See “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources”.
 
Business Overview
 
We are a leading producer and marketer of low-carbon renewable fuels in the United States.
 
We operate nine strategically-located production facilities. Four of our plants are in the Western states of California, Oregon and Idaho, and five of our plants are located in the Midwestern states of Illinois and Nebraska. We are the sixth largest producer of ethanol in the United States based on annualized volumes. Our plants have a combined production capacity of 605 million gallons per year. We market all the ethanol, specialty alcohols and co-products produced at our plants as well as ethanol produced by third parties. On an annualized basis, we market nearly 1.0 billion gallons of ethanol and over 3.0 million tons of ethanol co-products on a dry matter basis. Our business consists of two operating segments: a production segment and a marketing segment.
 
Our mission is to be a leading producer and marketer of low-carbon renewable fuels, high-value animal feed and high-quality alcohol products in the United States. We intend to accomplish this goal in part by investing in our ethanol production and distribution infrastructure, lowering the carbon intensity of our ethanol, extending our marketing business into new regional and international markets, and implementing new technologies to promote higher production yields and greater efficiencies.


Production Segment
 
We produce ethanol, specialty alcohols and co-products at our production facilities described below. Our plants located on the West Coast are near their respective fuel and feed customers, offering significant timing, transportation cost and logistical advantages. Our plants located in the Midwest are in the heart of the Corn Belt, benefit from low-cost and abundant feedstock production and allow for access to many additional domestic markets. In addition, our ability to load unit trains from our plants located in the Midwest, and barges from our Pekin, Illinois plants, allows for greater access to international markets.
 
We wholly-own all of our plants located on the West Coast and the three plants in Pekin, Illinois. We own approximately 74% of the two plants in Aurora, Nebraska as well as the grain elevator adjacent to those properties and related grain handling assets, including the outer rail loop, and the real property on which they are located, through Pacific Aurora, LLC, or Pacific Aurora, an entity owned approximately 26% by Aurora Cooperative Elevator Company, or ACEC.
 
All of our plants, with the exception of our Aurora East facility, are currently operating. Our Aurora East facility was idled in December 2018 due to unfavorable market conditions. As market conditions change, we may increase, decrease or idle production at one or more operating facilities or resume operations at any idled facility.

We produce ethanol co-products at our production facilities such as wet distillers grains, or WDG, dry distillers grains with solubles, or DDGS, wet and dry corn gluten feed, condensed distillers solubles, corn gluten meal, corn germ, corn oil, dried yeast and CO2.
 
Marketing Segment
 
We market ethanol, specialty alcohols and co-products produced by our facilities and market ethanol produced by third parties. We have extensive customer relationships throughout the Western and Midwestern United States. Our ethanol customers are integrated oil companies and gasoline marketers who blend ethanol into gasoline. Our customers depend on us to provide a reliable supply of ethanol, and manage the logistics and timing of delivery with very little effort on their part. Our customers collectively require ethanol volumes in excess of the supplies we produce at our production facilities. We secure additional ethanol supplies from third-party plants in California and other third-party suppliers in the Midwest where a majority of ethanol producers are located. We arrange for transportation, storage and delivery of ethanol purchased by our customers through our agreements with third-party service providers in the Western United States as well as in the Midwest from a variety of sources.
 
We market our distillers grains and other feed co-products to dairies and feedlots, in many cases located near our ethanol plants. These customers use our feed co-products for livestock as a substitute for corn and other sources of starch and protein. We sell our corn oil to poultry and biodiesel customers. We do not market co-products from other ethanol producers.

Business Strategy
 
Our primary goal is to be a leading producer and marketer of low-carbon renewable fuels, high-value animal feed and high-quality alcohol products in the United States. The key elements of our business and growth strategy to achieve this objective include:

● | Implement our strategic realignment plan. We have initiated and expect to complete over the next six months a strategic realignment of our business. Our primary focus is the potential sale of certain production assets and capital raising activities to reduce debt and strengthen our cash and liquidity, and on opportunities for strategic partnerships, positioning us to optimize our business performance.

● | Lower the carbon intensity of our ethanol. We plan to further reduce the carbon intensity of the ethanol we produce. We are able to sell this lower carbon intensity ethanol in certain regions at premium prices compared to higher carbon intensity ethanol. We are able to charge premium prices for this ethanol based on state laws and regulations, such as Low-Carbon Fuel Standards enacted in California and Oregon that require blenders to use lower carbon intensity ethanol in their gasoline. When available and cost-effective, we intend to use feedstock other than corn, including cellulosic feedstock, as the raw material used in the production of ethanol to further reduce the carbon intensity of our ethanol.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implement new equipment and technologies. We intend to continue to evaluate and implement new equipment and technologies to increase our production and operating efficiencies, reduce our use of carbon-based fuels and improve our carbon scores, use diverse feedstocks, diversify products and revenues, including through our production of advanced biofuels, and improve our plant profitability as financial resources and market conditions justify these investments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:
 

● | Our customer and supplier relationships. We have extensive business relationships with customers and suppliers throughout the United States. In addition, we have developed extensive business relationships with major and independent un-branded gasoline suppliers who collectively control the majority of all gasoline sales in those regions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ethanol distribution network. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to our experience in marketing to customers in major metropolitan and rural markets in the United States. We have developed an ethanol distribution network for delivery of ethanol by truck to virtually every significant fuel terminal as well as to numerous smaller fuel terminals throughout California and other Western states. Fuel terminals have limited storage capacity and we have successfully secured storage tanks at many of the terminals we service. In addition, we have an extensive network of third-party delivery trucks available to deliver ethanol throughout the Western United States. In the Midwest, we have the ability to sell and deliver products in bulk via unit trains providing us access to Western, gulf coast and international markets. Further, higher value co-products from our Illinois facilities can be sold at premium prices under fixed price, longer-term contracts (up to 12 months) thus providing a more stable source of revenue in what can be a volatile commodity industry.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our strategic locations. We operate our ethanol plants in markets where we believe their individual locations, as well as our overall ethanol production and marketing platform, provide strategic advantages. Our production in both the Western United States and in the Midwest enables us to source ethanol from two different regions, which we believe allows us to address regional inefficiencies and other challenges such as rail congestion and other supply constraints, as well as pricing anomalies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

○ | We operate four plants in the Western United States where we believe local characteristics create an opportunity to capture a significant production and shipping cost advantage over competing ethanol production facilities in other regions. We believe a combination of factors enables us to achieve this cost advantage, including:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Locations near fuel blending facilities lower our ethanol transportation costs while providing timing and logistical advantages over competing locations that require ethanol to be shipped over much longer distances, and in many cases require double-handling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Locations adjacent to major rail lines allow the efficient delivery of corn in large unit trains from major corn-producing regions and allow for the efficient delivery of ethanol in large unit trains to other markets, including markets with higher demand.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Locations near large concentrations of dairy and/or beef cattle enable delivery of WDG, over short distances without the need for costly drying processes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | We operate five plants in the Midwest which enables us to participate in the largest regional ethanol market in the United States as well as international markets. Our Midwest locations, coupled with our locations in the Western United States, also allow us many advantages over locations solely on the West Coast, including:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Locations in diverse markets assist us in spreading commodity and basis price risks across markets and products, supporting our efforts to optimize margin management. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Locations in the Midwest enhance our overall hedging opportunities with a greater correlation to the highly-liquid physical and paper markets in Chicago.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Locations in diverse markets support heightened flexibility and alternatives in feedstock procurement for our various production facilities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Our Illinois facilities provide excellent logistical access via rail, truck and barge. The relatively unique wet milling process at one of our Illinois facilities allows us to extract the highest use and value from each component of the corn kernel. As a result, the wet milling process generates a higher level of cost recovery from corn than that produced at a dry mill.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Locations in the Midwest allow us deeper market insight and engagement in major ethanol and feed markets outside the Western United States, thereby improving pricing opportunities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our low carbon-intensity ethanol. California and Oregon have enacted Low-Carbon Fuel Standards for transportation fuels. Under these Low-Carbon Fuel Standards, the ethanol we produce in the Western United States has a lower carbon-intensity than most ethanol produced at plants by other producers. This is primarily because our plants located on the West Coast use less energy in their production processes. The ethanol produced in California by other producers, all of which we market, also has a lower carbon-intensity rating than either gasoline or ethanol produced in the Midwest. The lower carbon-intensity rating of ethanol we produce at our plants located on the West Coast or otherwise resell from third-party California producers is valued in the market by our customers due to California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program, or LCFS, which has enabled us to capture premium prices for this ethanol.

● | Modern technologies. Our plants use the latest production technologies to take advantage of state-of-the-art technical and operational efficiencies to achieve lower operating costs, higher yields and more efficient production of ethanol and its co-products and reduce our use of carbon-based fuels.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our experienced management. Our senior management team has a proven track record with significant operational and financial expertise and many years of experience in the ethanol, fuel and energy industries. Our senior executives, who average approximately 19 years of industry experience, have successfully navigated a wide variety of business and industry-specific challenges and deeply understand the business of successfully producing and marketing ethanol and its co-products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that these competitive strengths will help us attain our goal to be a leading producer and marketer of low-carbon renewable fuels, high-value animal feed and high-quality alcohol products in the United States.
 
Industry Overview and Market Opportunity
 
Overview of Ethanol Market 
 
The primary applications for fuel-grade ethanol in the United States include:
 

● | Octane enhancer. On average, regular unleaded gasoline has an octane rating of 87 and premium unleaded gasoline has an octane rating of 91. In contrast, pure ethanol has an average octane rating of 113. Adding ethanol to gasoline enables refiners to produce greater quantities of lower octane blend stock with an octane rating of less than 87 before blending. In addition, ethanol is commonly added to finished regular grade gasoline as a means of producing higher octane mid-grade and premium gasoline.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fuel blending. In addition to its performance and environmental benefits, ethanol is used to extend fuel supplies. In light of the need for transportation fuel in the United States and the dependence on foreign crude oil and refined products, the United States is increasingly seeking domestic sources of fuel. Much of the ethanol blending throughout the United States is done for the purpose of extending the volume of fuel sold at the gasoline pump.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Renewable fuels. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to enable gasoline refiners to comply with a variety of governmental programs, in particular, the national Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS, which was enacted to promote alternatives to fossil fuels. See “—Governmental Regulation.”
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The United States ethanol industry is supported by federal and state legislation and regulation. For example, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which was signed into law in December 2007, significantly increased the prior RFS. Under the RFS, the mandated use of all renewable fuels rises incrementally in succeeding years and peaks at 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. Under the RFS, approximately 14.5 billion gallons in 2016 and 15.0 billion gallons in 2017 and 2018 were required from conventional, or corn-based, ethanol. Under the RFS, 15.0 billion gallons are required from conventional ethanol thru 2022. The RFS allows the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, to adjust the annual requirement based on certain facts.

According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the domestic ethanol industry produced a record 16.1 billion gallons of ethanol in 2018. We believe that the ethanol market in California alone represented approximately 10% of the national market. However, the Western United States has relatively few ethanol facilities and local ethanol production levels are substantially below the local demand for ethanol. The balance of ethanol is shipped via rail from the Midwest to the Western United States. Gasoline and diesel fuel that supply the major fuel terminals are shipped in pipelines throughout portions of the Western United States. Unlike gasoline and diesel fuel, however, ethanol is not shipped in these types of pipelines because ethanol has an affinity for mixing with water already present in the pipelines. When mixed, water dilutes ethanol and creates significant quality control issues. Therefore, ethanol must be trucked from rail terminals to regional fuel terminals, or blending racks.
 
We believe that approximately 90% of the ethanol produced in the United States is made in the Midwest from corn. According to the Department of Energy, or DOE, ethanol is generally blended at a rate of 10% by volume, but is also blended at a rate of up to 85% by volume for vehicles designed to operate on 85% ethanol. The EPA has increased the allowable blend of ethanol in gasoline from 10% by volume to 15% by volume for model year 2001 and newer automobiles, pending final approvals by certain state regulatory authorities. Some retailers have begun blending at higher rates in states that have approved higher blend rates.
 
Compared to gasoline, ethanol is generally considered to be cleaner burning and contains higher octane. We anticipate that the increasing demand for renewable transportation fuels coupled with limited opportunities for gasoline refinery expansions and the growing importance of reducing CO2 emissions through the use of renewable fuels will generate additional growth in the demand for ethanol.
 
According to the DOE, total annual gasoline consumption in the United States is approximately 143 billion gallons and total annual ethanol consumption represented approximately 10% of this amount in 2018. The domestic ethanol industry has substantially reached this 10% blend ratio, and we believe the industry has significant potential for growth in the event the industry can migrate to an up to 15% blend ratio, which would translate into an annual demand of up to 20 billion gallons of ethanol.
 
On November 30, 2018 the EPA released a final rule which set the 2019 renewable volume obligation, or RVO, as part of the EPA’s annual volume-setting responsibility under the RFS. For total renewable fuel, the RVO was finalized at 19.92 billion gallons, up 63 million gallons when compared to an RVO of 19.29 billion gallons set for 2018. We believe this is a step forward for the renewable fuels industry with the RVO for 2019 sending a strong signal to the marketplace through a 15 billion gallon commitment to conventional ethanol and a 418 million gallon commitment for cellulosic biofuels. 
 
Overview of Ethanol Production Process
 
Ethanol production from starch- or sugar-based feedstock is a highly-efficient process that we believe yields substantially more energy from ethanol and its co-products than is required to make the products. The modern production of ethanol requires large amounts of corn, or other high-starch grains, and water as well as chemicals, enzymes and yeast, and denaturants including unleaded gasoline or liquid natural gas, in addition to natural gas and electricity.
Dry Milling Process
 
In the dry milling process, corn or other high-starch grain is first ground into meal, then slurried with water to form a mash. Enzymes are then added to the mash to convert the starch into the simple sugar, dextrose. Ammonia is also added for acidic (pH) control and as a nutrient for the yeast. The mash is processed through a high temperature cooking procedure, which reduces bacteria levels prior to fermentation. The mash is then cooled and transferred to fermenters, where yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to ethanol and CO2 begins.
 
-6- 

 

After fermentation, the resulting “beer” is transferred to distillation, where the ethanol is separated from the residual “stillage.” The ethanol is concentrated to 190 proof using conventional distillation methods and then is dehydrated to approximately 200 proof, representing 100% alcohol levels, in a molecular sieve system. The resulting anhydrous ethanol is then blended with about 2.5% denaturant, which is usually gasoline, and is then ready for shipment to market.
 
The residual stillage is separated into a coarse grain portion and a liquid portion through a centrifugation process. The soluble liquid portion is concentrated to about 40% dissolved solids by an evaporation process. This intermediate state is called condensed distillers solubles, or syrup. The coarse grain and syrup portions are then mixed to produce WDG or can be mixed and dried to produce DDGS. Both WDG and DDGS are high-protein animal feed products.
 
Wet Milling Process
 
In the wet milling process, corn or other high-starch grain is first soaked or “steeped” in water for 24 – 48 hours to separate the grain into its many components. After steeping, the corn slurry is processed first to separate the corn germ, from which the corn oil can be further separated. The remaining fiber, gluten and starch components are further separated and sold.
 
The steeping liquor is concentrated in an evaporator. The concentrated product, called heavy steep water, is co-dried with the fiber component and is then sold as corn gluten feed. The gluten component is filtered and dried to produce corn gluten meal.
 
The starch and any remaining water from the mash is then processed into ethanol or dried and processed into corn syrup. The fermentation process for ethanol at this stage is similar to the dry milling process.
 
Overview of Distillers Grains Market
 
Distillers grains are produced as a co-product of ethanol production and are valuable components of feed rations primarily to dairies and beef cattle markets, both nationally and internationally. Our plants produce both WDG and DDGS. WDG is sold to customers proximate to the plants and DDGS is delivered by truck, rail and barge to customers in domestic and international markets.
 
Producing WDG also allows us to use up to one-third less process energy, thus reducing production costs and lowering the carbon footprint of these plants, thereby increasing demand in California where premiums are paid for the low-carbon attributes.
 
Historically, the market price for distillers grains has generally tracked the value of corn. We believe that the market price of WDG and DDGS is determined by a number of factors, including the market value of corn, soybean meal and other competitive ingredients, the performance or value of WDG and DDGS in a particular feed formulation and general market forces of supply and demand, including export markets for these co-products. The market price of distillers grains is also often influenced by nutritional models that calculate the feed value of distillers grains by nutritional content, as well as reliability of consistent supply.
 
Customers
 
We market and sell through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kinergy Marketing LLC, or Kinergy, all of the ethanol produced by our production facilities. Kinergy also markets ethanol produced by third parties. We have extensive customer relationships throughout the Western and Midwestern United States. Our ethanol customers are integrated oil companies and gasoline marketers who blend ethanol into gasoline. Our customers depend on us to provide a reliable supply of ethanol, and manage the logistics and timing of delivery with very little effort on their side. Our customers collectively require ethanol volumes in excess of the supplies we produce at our production facilities. We secure additional ethanol supplies from third-party plants in California and other third-party suppliers in the Midwest where a majority of ethanol producers are located. We arrange for transportation, storage and delivery of ethanol purchased by our customers through our agreements with third-party service providers in the Western United States as well as in the Midwest from a variety of sources.
 
-7- 

 

We also market all of the co-products produced at our plants. We do not market co-products from other ethanol producers. Our co-products include WDG, DDGS, wet and dry corn gluten feed, condensed distillers solubles, corn gluten meal, corn germ, corn oil, dried yeast and CO2. We market our distillers grains and other feed co-products to dairies and feedlots, in many cases located near our ethanol plants. These customers use our feed co-products for livestock as a substitute for corn and other sources of starch and protein. We sell our corn oil to poultry and biodiesel customers.
 
Our production segment generated $859.8 million, $845.7 million and $797.4 million in net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, from the sale of ethanol. Our production segment generated $296.7 million, $257.0 million and $248.4 million in net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, from the sale of co-products.
 
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, our production segment sold an aggregate of approximately 556.2 million, 527.2 million and 484.1 million gallons of ethanol and 3.1 million, 3.0 million and 2.8 million tons of ethanol co-products, respectively.
 
Our marketing segment generated $358.9 million, $529.5 million and $579.0 million in net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, from the sale of ethanol.
 
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we produced or purchased ethanol from third parties and resold an aggregate of approximately 762 million, 837 million and 816 million gallons of fuel-grade ethanol and specialty alcohols to approximately 80, 83 and 81 customers, respectively. Sales to our two largest customers, Valero Energy Corporation and Chevron Products USA in 2018, 2017 and 2016 represented an aggregate of approximately 25%, 27% and 29%, of our net sales, respectively. Sales to each of our other customers represented less than 10% of our net sales in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016.
 
Suppliers
 
Production Segment
 
Our production operations are dependent upon various raw materials suppliers, including suppliers of corn, natural gas, electricity and water. The cost of corn is the most important variable cost associated with our production. We source corn for our plants using standard contracts, including spot purchase, forward purchase and basis contracts. When resources are available, we seek to limit the exposure of our production operations to raw material price fluctuations by purchasing forward a portion of our corn requirements on a fixed price basis and by purchasing corn and other raw materials futures contracts.
 
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, purchases of corn from our four largest suppliers represented an aggregate of approximately 52%, 46% and 38% of our total corn purchases, respectively, for those periods. Purchases from each of our other corn suppliers represented less than 10% of total corn purchases in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Marketing Segment
 
Our marketing operations are dependent upon various third-party producers of fuel-grade ethanol. In addition, we provide ethanol transportation, storage and delivery services through third-party service providers with whom we have contracted to receive ethanol at agreed upon locations from our third-party suppliers and to store and/or deliver the ethanol to agreed-upon locations on behalf of our customers. These contracts generally run from year-to-year, subject to termination by either party upon advance written notice before the end of the then current annual term.
 
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we purchased and resold from third parties an aggregate of approximately 206 million, 310 million and 334 million gallons, respectively, of fuel-grade ethanol.
 
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, purchases of fuel-grade ethanol from our two largest third-party suppliers represented an aggregate of approximately 40%, 35% and 35% of our total third-party ethanol purchases, respectively, for those periods. Purchases from each of our other third-party ethanol suppliers represented less than 10% of total third-party ethanol purchases in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016.
 
Pacific Ethanol Plants
 
The table below provides an overview of our nine ethanol production facilities. Our plants have an aggregate annual production capacity of up to 605 million gallons. All of our plants, with the exception of our Aurora East facility, are currently operating. As market conditions change, we may increase, decrease or idle production at one or more operating facilities or resume operations at any idled facility. 
 
We wholly-own all of our plants located on the West Coast and the three plants in Pekin, Illinois. We own approximately 74% of the plants in Aurora, Nebraska as well as the grain elevator adjacent to those properties and related grain handling assets, including the outer rail loop, and the real property on which they are located, through Pacific Aurora, an entity owned approximately 26% by ACEC.

Commodity Risk Management
 
We employ various risk mitigation techniques. For example, we may seek to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by purchasing forward a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements through fixed-price or variable-price contracts with our suppliers, as well as entering into derivative contracts for ethanol, corn and natural gas. To mitigate ethanol inventory price risks, we may sell a portion of our production forward under fixed- or index-price contracts, or both. We may hedge a portion of the price risks by selling exchange-traded futures contracts. Proper execution of these risk mitigation strategies can reduce the volatility of our gross profit margins. However, the market price of ethanol is volatile and subject to large fluctuations, and given the nature of our business, we cannot effectively hedge against extreme volatility or certain market conditions. For example, ethanol prices, as reported by the Chicago Board of Trade, or CBOT, ranged from $1.20 to $1.53 per gallon during 2018, from $1.26 to $1.67 per gallon during 2017 and from $1.31 to $1.75 per gallon during 2016; and corn prices, as reported by the CBOT, ranged from $3.30 to $4.09 per bushel during 2018, from $3.30 to $3.92 per bushel during 2017 and from $3.02 to $4.38 per bushel during 2016.

Marketing Arrangements
 
We market all the ethanol and specialty alcohols produced at our production facilities. In addition, we have exclusive ethanol marketing agreements with two third-party ethanol producers, Calgren Renewable Fuels, LLC and Aemetis Advanced Fuels Keyes, Inc., to market and sell their entire ethanol production volumes. Calgren Renewable Fuels, LLC owns and operates an ethanol production facility in Pixley, California with annual production capacity of 55 million gallons. Aemetis Advanced Fuels Keyes, Inc. owns and operates an ethanol production facility in Keyes, California with annual production capacity of 55 million gallons. We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to enter into marketing arrangements with other third-party ethanol producers as business prospects make these marketing arrangements advisable.
Competition
 
We are the sixth largest producer of ethanol in the United States based on annualized volumes and operate in the highly competitive ethanol production and marketing industry. The largest ethanol producers in the United States are Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, POET, LLC, Green Plains Inc. and Valero Renewable Fuels Company, LLC, collectively with approximately 38% of the total installed ethanol production capacity in the United States. In addition, there are many mid-size producers with several plants under ownership, smaller producers with one or two plants, and several ethanol marketers that create significant competition. Overall, we believe there are over 200 ethanol production facilities in the United States with a total installed production capacity of approximately 16.5 billion gallons and many brokers and marketers with whom we compete for sales of ethanol and its co-products.
 
We believe that our competitive strengths include our customer and supplier relationships, our extensive ethanol distribution network, our strategic locations, our low carbon-intensity ethanol, our use of modern technologies at our production facilities and our experienced management. We believe that these advantages will help us to attain our goal to be a leading producer and marketer of low-carbon renewable fuels, high-value animal feed and high-quality alcohol products in the United States.
 
Most of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States have fuel terminals served by rail, but other major metropolitan areas and more remote smaller cities and rural areas do not. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in the Western United States in particular due to our experience in marketing to the segment of customers located in major metropolitan and rural markets in the Western United States. We manage the complicated logistics of shipping ethanol to intermediate storage locations throughout the Western United States and trucking the ethanol from these storage locations to blending racks where the ethanol is blended with gasoline. We believe that by establishing an efficient service for truck deliveries to these more remote locations, we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors on the West Coast. In addition, due to our plant locations on the West Coast, we believe that we benefit from our ability to increase spot sales of ethanol from those plants following ethanol price spikes caused from time to time by rail delays in delivering ethanol from the Midwest to the Western United States.
 
Our strategic locations in the Western United States designed to capitalize on cost efficiencies may nevertheless result in higher than expected costs as a result of more expensive raw materials and related shipping costs, including corn, which generally must be transported from the Midwest. If the costs of producing and shipping ethanol and its co-products over short distances are not advantageous relative to the costs of obtaining raw materials from the Midwest, then the benefits of our strategic locations on the West Coast may not be realized.

Governmental Regulation
 
Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the production of renewable fuels, the protection of the environment and in support of the corn and ethanol industries. These laws, their underlying regulatory requirements and their enforcement, some of which are described below, impact, or may impact, our existing and proposed business operations by imposing:

● | restrictions on our existing and proposed business operations and/or the need to install enhanced or additional controls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the need to obtain and comply with permits and authorizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | liability for exceeding applicable permit limits or legal requirements, in some cases for the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at our facilities, contiguous and adjacent properties and other properties owned and/or operated by third parties; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | specifications for the ethanol we market and produce.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, some governmental regulations are helpful to our ethanol production and marketing business. The ethanol fuel industry is supported by federal and state mandates and environmental regulations that favor the use of ethanol in motor fuel blends in North America. Some of the governmental regulations applicable to our ethanol production and marketing business are briefly described below.
 
National Energy Legislation
 
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which was signed into law in December 2007, significantly increased the prior RFS. The RFS significantly increases the mandated use of renewable fuels, rising incrementally each year, to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022.
 
Under the provisions of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA has the authority to waive the mandated RFS requirements in whole or in part. To grant a waiver, the EPA administrator must determine, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, that there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States as a whole.
 
Policy discussion has begun in the 116th Congress aimed at shifting national power generation to renewable sources and to decarbonize manufacturing and agricultural industries. On February 7, 2019, Democrats in both the House and Senate introduced non-binding resolutions, H.Res. 109 and S.Res. 59, Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal. The resolutions, referred to as the Green New Deal, outline these goals by providing a blueprint to transition the United States to a 100 percent clean energy system. Expanding from this policy, recently the Utilizing Significant Emissions with Innovative Technologies (USE IT) Act was introduced in both chambers. The USE IT Act aims to spur the development and demonstration of carbon capture and removal technologies. This legislation has the potential to benefit ethanol producers, as well as a large group of other stakeholders by authorizing grants for these technologies and by streamlining the permitting process for building pipelines that move sequestered carbon. The bills have been referred to their respective congressional subcommittees where they await further consideration.

A bill titled the Consumer Protection and Fuel Transparency Act of 2019 (H.R 1024), was introduced on February 6, 2019, which would require the EPA Administrator to revise labeling requirements for fuel pumps that dispense gasoline that contains up to 15% ethanol by volume, or E15. Specifically, the legislation would require labels for fuel pumps that dispense E15 to include the word “WARNING” and “check your owner’s manual.” In addition, the bill would require the EPA to develop a public education campaign on the supposed risks associated with improper E15 use. EPA gave final approval in 2012 to the use of E15 fuel and the fuel blend is now sold in 30 states. The EPA is already required to label at the pump therefore we believe this bill could confuse consumers and retailers who opt to use E15. This bill was referred to a congressional subcommittee where it awaits further consideration. 


E15 (a Blend of Gasoline and Ethanol)
 
The EPA has allowed fuel and fuel-additive manufacturers to introduce into commercial gasoline that contains greater than 10% ethanol by volume, up to 15% ethanol by volume, for vehicles from model year 2001 and beyond. Additional changes to some states’ laws to allow for the use of E15 are still required; however, commercial sale of E15 has begun in a majority of states. At the end of 2018, there were over 1,500 stations offering E15 across 30 states. The number of retailers offering E15 is anticipated to exceed 2,000 in 2019.
 
State Energy Legislation and Regulations
 
In January 2007, California’s Governor signed an executive order directing the California Air Resources Board to implement California’s LCFS for transportation fuels. California’s LCFS requires fuel suppliers to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels to 10% below 2010 levels by 2020. The Governor’s office estimates that the standard will have the effect of increasing current renewable fuels use in California by three to five times by 2020.
 
The California Air Resources Board has engaged in a comprehensive process to consider extending California’s LCFS through 2030, applying aggressive new carbon intensity reduction targets for the final 10 years. Additional LCFS updates became effective in early January 2019 which require fuel suppliers to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels to 20% below 2010 levels by 2030. We believe the revised program will be beneficial as we produce among the lowest carbon intensity ethanol commercially available, and we receive a premium for the fuel we sell into the California marketplace, which we expect will increase as the compliance curve steepens, which began in 2016.
 
A program similar to California’s LCFS has also been adopted in Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia, and is under discussion in Washington State. These regions, together with California, represent a very large segment of the overall demand for transportation fuels in the United States.
 
Additional Environmental Regulations
 
In addition to the governmental regulations applicable to the ethanol production and marketing industry described above, our business is subject to additional federal, state and local environmental regulations, including regulations established by the EPA, the San Joaquin Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District and the California Air Resources Board. We cannot predict the manner or extent to which these regulations will harm or help our business or the ethanol production and marketing industry in general.
Employees
 
As of March 14, 2019, we had approximately 510 full-time employees. We believe that our employees are highly-skilled, and our success will depend in part upon our ability to retain our employees and attract new qualified employees, many of whom are in great demand. Approximately 35% of our employees are presently represented by a labor union and covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never had a work stoppage or strike and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
