Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview 
 RH (“we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a leading luxury retailer in the home furnishings marketplace. Our curated and fully-integrated assortments are presented consistently across our sales channels in sophisticated and unique lifestyle settings that we believe are on par with world-class interior designers. We offer dominant merchandise assortments across a growing number of categories, including furniture, lighting, textiles, bathware, décor, outdoor and garden, and child and teen furnishings. We position our Galleries as showrooms for our brand, while our Source Books and websites act as virtual extensions of our stores. In 2015 we began to introduce an integrated hospitality experience, including cafés, wine vaults and barista bars, into a number of our new Gallery locations. We believe this has created a unique new retail experience that cannot be replicated online, and that the addition of hospitality is helping to drive incremental sales of home furnishings in these Galleries.
 Our business is fully integrated across our multiple channels of distribution, consisting of our stores, Source Books, and websites. As of February 2, 2019, we operated a total of 86 retail Galleries consisting of 20 Design Galleries, 43 legacy Galleries, 2 RH Modern Galleries and 6 RH Baby & Child Galleries throughout the United States and Canada, and 15 Waterworks showrooms throughout the United States and in the U.K. As of February 2, 2019, 6 of our Design Galleries include an integrated RH Hospitality experience and we plan to incorporate hospitality, including cafés, wine vaults and barista bars in many of the new Galleries that we open in the future. As of February 2, 2019, we operated 39 outlet stores throughout the United States and Canada.
 Products and Product Development
 We have positioned RH as a lifestyle brand and design authority by offering dominant merchandise assortments. We are merchants of luxury home furnishings and our luxury products embody our design aesthetic and reflect inspiration from across the centuries and around the globe.
 We have developed a proprietary product development platform that is fully integrated from ideation to presentation. Key aspects of our product development platform are: 
  
• | Organization—We have established a collaborative, cross-functional organization centered on product leadership and coordinated across our product development, sourcing, merchandising, inventory and creative teams. Our product teams are focused on maximizing the sales potential of each product category across all channels, which eliminates channel conflicts and functional redundancies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Process—For many of our products, we work closely with our network of artisan partners who possess specialized product development and manufacturing capabilities and who we consider an extension of our product development team. We collaborate with our global network of specialty vendors and manufacturers to produce artisanal pieces on a large scale with a high level of quality and value, including both distinctive original designs and reinterpretations of antiques.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Facility—We have built the RH Center of Innovation and Product Leadership, a facility which supports the entire product development process from product ideation to presentation for all channels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As a result of our proprietary organization, process and facility, our typical product lead times are 3 – 9 months, which enhances our ability to introduce more new products with each collection. In addition, our product development platform, sourcing capabilities and significant scale enable us to reduce our product costs.
 Sales Channels 
 We distribute our products through a fully integrated sales platform comprised of our Stores, E-Commerce, Source Books and Trade and Contract. We believe the level of integration among all of our channels and our approach to the market distinguishes us from most other retailers. For fiscal 2018, sales of products originating in our stores represented 56% of our net revenues, while sales from our direct businesses represented 44% of our net revenues. We believe our channels complement each other and our customers’ buying decisions are influenced by their experiences across more than one of our sales channels. We encourage our customers to shop across our channels and have aligned our business and internal organization to be channel agnostic. Our integrated distribution and product delivery network serves all of our channels. We believe the key advantage of our multiple sales channels is our ability to leverage the unique attributes of each channel in our approach to the market.

Stores 
 Retail Galleries
 Our retail Galleries are located in upscale malls and street locations, as well as in iconic locations. We believe situating our Galleries in desirable locations is critical to the success of our business, and we identify Gallery locations based on a variety of factors, including deal economics and availability of suitable new site locations based on several store specific aspects, such as geographic location, demographics, and proximity to affluent consumers. We pursue a market-based sales strategy, whereby we assess each market’s overall sales potential and how best to approach the market across all of our channels. We customize square footage, as well as catalog circulation, to maximize each market’s sales potential and increase our return on invested capital. 
 Our retail Galleries reinforce our luxury brand aesthetic and are highly differentiated from other home furnishings retailers. We have revolutionized the customer experience by showcasing products in a sophisticated lifestyle setting that we believe is on par with world-class interior designers, consistent with the imagery and product presentation featured in our catalogs and on our websites. Products in our Galleries are presented in fully appointed rooms, emphasizing collections over individual pieces. This presentation encourages a higher average order value as customers are inspired to consider purchasing a full collection of products to replicate the design aesthetic experienced in our Galleries. In addition, our store associates use iPads and other devices to allow customers to shop our entire merchandise assortment while in the Gallery.
 We operate the following distinct store types as of February 2, 2019:
  
1) | Design Galleries, which average approximately 33,000 leased selling square feet;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Legacy Galleries, which average approximately 8,000 leased selling square feet;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | RH Modern Galleries, which are located in Los Angeles and Dallas, and which average approximately 11,000 leased selling square feet;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | RH Baby & Child Galleries, which average approximately 4,000 leased selling square feet; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) | Waterworks showrooms, which average approximately 4,000 leased selling square feet.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have identified key learnings from our real estate transformation that have supported the development of a new multi-tier market approach that we believe will optimize both market share and return on invested capital over time.
 First, we have developed a new RH prototype Design Gallery that is an innovative and flexible blueprint, which we believe will enable us to more quickly place our disruptive product assortment and immersive retail experience into the market. The new model is a standard we will utilize in the future that is based on key learnings from our recent Gallery openings and will range in size from 33,000 leased selling square feet inclusive of our integrated hospitality experience to 29,000 leased selling square feet without. These new Galleries will represent our assortments from RH Interiors, Modern, Baby & Child, Teen and Outdoor and contain interior design offices and presentation rooms where design professionals can work with clients on their projects. Due to the reduced square footage compared to our recent Design Gallery openings and the efficient design, this new model will be more capital efficient with less development time and cost risk, but yield similar productivity. We anticipate the new prototype Design Galleries will represent approximately two thirds of our target markets. Future prototype location examples include Edina, MN, Corte Madera, CA, Columbus, OH and Charlotte, NC.
 Second, we will continue to develop and open larger Bespoke Design Galleries in the top metropolitan markets, similar to those we opened in New York and Chicago. These iconic locations are highly profitable statements for our brand, and we believe they create a long-term competitive advantage that will be difficult to duplicate.
 Third, we will continue to open indigenous Bespoke Galleries in the best second home markets where the wealthy and affluent visit and vacation. These Galleries are tailored to reflect the local culture and are sized to the potential of each market. Examples of indigenous Bespoke Galleries include the Hamptons, Palm Beach, Yountville and Aspen.
 Fourth, we are developing a new Gallery model tailored to secondary markets. Targeted to be 10,000 to 18,000 square feet, we believe these smaller expressions of our brand will enable us to gain share in markets currently only served by smaller competitors. Examples of target secondary markets include Hartford, CT, Oklahoma City, OK and Milwaukee, WI, among others. We expect these Galleries to require a substantially smaller net investment than our larger Design Galleries and to pay back our capital investment within two years in most instances. Our plan is to test a few of these Galleries over the next several years, and if proven successful, this format could lead to an increase in our long-term Gallery targets.
 2


We believe our multi-tier market approach to transforming our real estate will enable us to ramp our opening cadence from 3 to 5 new Galleries per year, to a pace of 5 to 7 new Galleries per year.
 We continue to evaluate potential opportunities for standalone RH Baby & Child, RH Teen and RH Modern Galleries in select markets.
 In 2015 we began to introduce an integrated hospitality experience, including cafés, wine vaults and barista bars, into a number of our new Gallery locations. We believe this has created a unique new retail experience that cannot be replicated online, and that the addition of hospitality is helping to drive incremental sales of home furnishings in these Galleries. As of February 2, 2019, 6 of our Design Galleries include an integrated RH Hospitality experience and we plan to incorporate hospitality, including cafés, wine vaults and barista bars in many of the new Galleries that we open in the future.

----+----------------------------------------------

 
We continually analyze opportunities to selectively consolidate stores in connection with openings of our Design Galleries or close stores that have been under-performing or are no longer consistent with our brand positioning. In many cases, we continue to operate a store until its lease has expired in order to effect the closure in a cost-efficient manner.
 Outlet Stores 
 Our outlet stores are branded as Restoration Hardware Outlet or RH Outlet and are typically located in outlet malls. Our outlet stores serve as a key part of our reverse logistics platform and provide an efficient means to sell primarily returned merchandise and, to a lesser extent, discontinued and overstock merchandise outside of our core sales channels.
 E-Commerce 
 Our primary RH websites, www.rh.com, www.restorationhardware.com, www.rhmodern.com, www.rhbabyandchild.com and www.rhteen.com, provide our customers with the ability to purchase our merchandise online. We sell Waterworks products online through www.waterworks.com.
 Our e-commerce platform allows our customers to experience the unique lifestyle settings reflected in our catalogs and throughout our stores, and to shop substantially all of our current product assortment. We update our websites regularly to reflect new products, product availability and occasionally special offers.
 The RH websites also offer room-based navigation, which allows the customer to envision and shop items by room or by product, expanding on the richness of the online experience. For example, customers can search our websites for products by size or color, browse through our extensive product categories and see detailed information about each item and collection, such as dimensions, materials and care instructions. Additionally, customers can select color swatches and view merchandise displayed with different color and fabric options.

Source Books 
 We produce a series of catalogs, which we refer to as Source Books, to showcase our merchandise assortment. In fiscal 2018, our mailed Source Books included RH Interiors, RH Outdoor, RH Modern, RH Rugs, RH Teen, RH Baby & Child and RH Holiday. Our Source Books are one of our primary branding and advertising vehicles. We have found that merchandise assortments displayed in our Source Books contribute to increased sales of those products across all of our channels. As in our retail stores, our Source Books present our merchandise in lifestyle settings that reflect our unique design aesthetic. Our Source Books also feature profiles of select artisan vendors and other compelling editorial content regarding home décor. All creative work on our Source Books is coordinated in-house in our RH Center of Innovation & Product Leadership, providing us greater control over the brand image presented to our customers, while also reducing our Source Book production costs. 
 Our Source Book mailings serve as a key driver of sales through both our websites and retail stores. Our customers respond to the Source Books across all of our channels, with sales trends closely correlating to the assortments that we emphasize and feature prominently in our Source Books, websites and retail Galleries. We continue to evaluate and optimize our Source Book strategy based on our experience.
 We maintain a database of customer information, including customer information from our RH Members Program, which includes sales patterns, detailed purchasing information, certain demographic information, as well as mailing and email addresses. We mail our Source Books to addresses within this database and to addresses provided to us by third parties. The database supports our ability to analyze our customers’ buying behaviors across sales channels and facilitates the development of targeted marketing strategies, and is maintained in accordance with our privacy policy disclosed on our website. We segment our customer files based on multiple variables, and we tailor our Source Book mailings and emails in response to the purchasing patterns and product needs of our customers. We focus on continually improving the segmentation of customer files and the expansion of our customer database.
 Our Source Books, in concert with our e-commerce channel, are a cost-effective means of testing new products, and allow us to launch categories in a disciplined, expeditious and cost-effective manner. 
 Trade and Contract
 In addition to our core channels, we continue to expand into B2B channels, including Trade and Contract. In the Trade channel, we work directly with independent interior designers and decorators purchasing products for their clients’ residential projects. We also sell directly to customers who make purchases with the assistance of their interior designers or decorators, which we refer to as “designer-assisted sales.” Our Contract business supplies products to large-scale hospitality, commercial and residential development projects, working with architecture and design firms, developers and their ecosystem of business partners. These channels offer additional avenues for reaching new customers, including both businesses and individuals.
Marketing and Advertising 
 Our retail Galleries and our Source Books are the primary branding and advertising vehicles for the RH brands. In addition, we employ a variety of marketing and advertising vehicles to drive customer traffic across all our channels, strengthen and reinforce our brand image and acquire new customers. These include targeted Source Book circulation, promotional mailings, email communications, online and print advertisements, and public relations activities and events. We maintain a database of customers, which includes sales patterns, detailed purchasing information, certain demographic information, as well as mailing and email addresses. We use our customer database to tailor our programs and increase productivity of our marketing and promotion initiatives. We leverage our marketing and advertising expenses across all our channels as we seek to optimize the efficiency of our investment. 
 The highly-differentiated design aesthetic and shopping environment of our stores drive customer traffic not only to our stores but also to our direct channels. Our Source Books and targeted emails further reinforce the RH brand image and drive sales across all of our sales channels. We also engage in a wide range of other marketing, promotional and public relations activities to promote our brands. These campaigns include media coverage in design, lifestyle, culture/society and specialty publications, as well as in-store events related to new store openings and product launches. We also engage print advertising in brand-relevant publications such as Architectural Digest, Elle Décor, Veranda, Town and Country, The New York Times, WSJ and others, and deliver marketing messages to customers via online advertising. We believe that these efforts will drive increased brand awareness, leading to higher sales in our stores and our direct businesses over time.

RH Members Program
 The RH Members Program is an exclusive membership program that reimagines and simplifies the shopping experience. For an annual fee, the RH Members Program provides a set discount every day across all RH brands, excluding Waterworks, in addition to other benefits including complimentary interior design services through the RH Interior Design program and eligibility for preferred financing plans on the RH Credit Card, among other benefits. We introduced the RH Members Program in March 2016 as an alternative to prior practices involving numerous event-driven promotions. The RH Members Program allows our customers to shop for what they want, when they want, and receive the greatest value, which has resulted in orders and sales being more evenly distributed throughout the year as opposed to the peaks and valleys of orders and sales we experienced prior to the introduction of the program. We believe that our shift from a promotional event model to a membership model has enhanced the customer experience, rendered our brand more valuable, improved operational execution and reduced costs. 
Sourcing 
 We primarily contract with third-party vendors for the manufacture of our merchandise. Our sourcing strategy focuses on identifying and using vendors that can provide the quality materials and fine craftsmanship that our customers expect of our brand. To ensure that our high standards of quality and timely delivery of merchandise are met, we work closely with vendors and manufacturers. Our products are generally made from readily available raw materials. We seek to ensure the consistent quality of our manufacturers’ products by selectively inspecting pre-production samples, conducting periodic site visits to certain of our vendors’ production facilities and selectively inspecting inbound shipments at our distribution facilities. In fiscal 2018, we sourced approximately 75% of our purchase dollar volume from approximately 27 vendors. In fiscal 2018, one vendor accounted for approximately 11% of our purchase dollar volume. Based on total dollar volume of purchases for fiscal 2018, approximately 73% of our products were sourced in Asia, with approximately 41% sourced from China, 15% from the United States and the remainder from other countries and regions. In fiscal 2017, approximately 77% of our products were sourced in Asia, with approximately 46% sourced from China, 14% from the United States and the remainder from other countries and regions.
 RH is committed to offering safe, legal, high quality products, made consistently with our values. RH has a Compliance and Social Responsibility team dedicated to ensuring we keep these commitments through product testing, audits and other verification methods. Product testing is a core process for our organization. RH Baby & Child offers an extensive selection of GREENGUARD Gold Certificated children’s furniture. GREENGUARD Gold Certified products aid in the creation of healthier indoor environments by emitting fewer airborne chemical compounds that can contribute to health issues, including asthma, allergies and other respiratory conditions. We are in the process of obtaining GREENGUARD Certification for all of our indoor furniture products.
 While we currently do not have any long-term merchandise supply contracts, we believe that we generally have strong relationships with our product vendors. Although we transact business primarily on an order-by-order basis, we typically work with many of our vendors over extended periods of time, and many vendors are making long-term capacity investments to serve our increasing demands. 
 Distribution and Delivery
 We manage the distribution and delivery of our products through our distribution centers. We currently operate two furniture fulfillment centers and one small parcel fulfillment center servicing RH products, which are located strategically in three markets throughout the United States. We have one fulfillment center in the United States servicing Waterworks products.
 In fiscal 2017, we began architecting a new operating platform in order to simplify our business, enhance the customer experience, and amplify decision quality and speed. Our initial efforts focused on our distribution center network and the home delivery experience. As a result of our work to redesign our distribution network and optimize inventory, we were able to forego building a fifth furniture distribution center planned to open in fiscal 2017, and completed the closure of our furniture fulfillment centers in Mira Loma, CA and Dallas, TX. In fiscal 2018, we completed the closure of our furniture fulfillment center in Essex, MD. In total, we eliminated 2.3 million square feet of distribution center space, resulting in savings in excess of $25 million annually. We believe servicing our furniture business from two coastal distribution centers will result in improved in-stock availability and faster inventory turns, while reducing operating costs. 
 We operate portions of our home delivery services in 16 key markets to leverage operating costs and improve our customers’ delivery experience, while reducing returns and damage to our products. We plan to continue to in-source these services in additional markets over time. We offer a white glove home delivery service for our larger merchandise and furniture categories, where third-party personnel deliver fully assembled items to the location of our customers’ choice. We believe there is an opportunity to improve the customer experience by taking greater control of the home delivery experience over time. We believe that many third-party furniture delivery providers are designed to support mass and mid-market companies and that significant opportunity exists for developing improved solutions for the luxury market. We have achieved significant scale such that we can now explore and test alternative solutions in many markets, including the use of our own trucks and drivers, and believe we can dramatically enhance the customer experience while reducing return rates, damages and deliveries per order. 
 6


Through our distribution center network redesign, reverse logistics and outlet redesign, and the reconceptualization of home delivery, we have improved our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities, and have built a scalable infrastructure to support our future growth. We believe our enhanced supply chain and fulfillment operations allow us to manage customer orders and distribute merchandise to our customers in an efficient and cost-effective manner. We also believe that these upgrades have improved customer satisfaction by reducing delivery times, reducing damage to merchandise, and improving our customer’s overall buying experience.
 Competition 
 The home furnishings industry is highly competitive. We primarily compete against a large number of independent retailers that provide unique items and custom-designed product offerings at high price points, including antique dealers and home furnishings retailers who market to the interior design community. We also compete with national and regional home furnishings retailers and department stores, as well as with mail order catalogs and online retailers focused on home furnishings.
 We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of design, quality and value, and that our distinct combination of these elements, along with the strength of our brand and our fully integrated multi-channel business model, allows us to compete effectively and differentiate ourselves from competitors. We compete with the interior design trade and specialty merchants by providing a high quality, broad product assortment at an exceptional value. We compete against certain other home furnishings retailers primarily by offering what we believe are superior quality, highly distinctive design styles and a sophisticated lifestyle presentation in our product offering.
 We also believe that our success depends in substantial part on our ability to originate and define product trends, as well as to timely anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands. Certain competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. However, many smaller specialty retailers may lack the financial resources, infrastructure, scale and national brand identity necessary to compete effectively with us. We believe we are effectively positioned to gain market share from both of these segments and drive growth.
 Employees
 As of February 2, 2019, we had approximately 5,200 employees, of which approximately 800 were part-time employees. As of that date, approximately 2,300 of our employees were based in our stores. None of our employees are represented by a union, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 
Intellectual Property 
 The “RH,” “Restoration Hardware,” “RH Modern,” “RH Baby & Child,” “RH Teen,” “Waterworks,” and “Waterworks Studio” trademarks, among others, are registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the trademark registries of several foreign countries. Each of our trademark registrations is perpetually renewable provided that we use or continue to use the trademarks in commerce in the particular geographic market and for the goods or services covered by the registration. In addition, we own many domain names, including “restorationhardware.com,” “rh.com,” “rhmodern.com,” “rhbabyandchild.com,” “rhteen.com,” and “waterworks.com” and others that include our trademarks. These domain names are perpetually renewable. We own design patents or pending applications to protect the ornamental appearance of several of our products. These design patents are valid for 14 years from the date of issuance. We own copyrights, including copyright registrations or pending applications, for our website and for several of our Source Books. We believe that our trademarks, design patents, and copyrights have significant value and we vigorously protect them against infringement. 
Fluctuation in Quarterly Results
 Our quarterly results vary depending upon a variety of factors, including our product offerings, store openings, shifts in the timing of holidays and the timing of Source Book releases, promotional events and the timing and extent of our realization of the costs and benefits of our numerous strategic initiatives, among other things. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands on our product distribution and delivery network may fluctuate during the year. Unique factors in any given quarter may affect period-to-period comparisons between the quarters being compared, and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year.
Corporate Information
 The Company was formed as a Delaware corporation on August 18, 2011. On November 7, 2012, the Company completed an initial public offering. On December 15, 2016, Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc. filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to change its name to “RH,” effective January 1, 2017.

Regulation and Legislation 
 We are subject to numerous regulations, including labor and employment laws, customs, laws governing truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, privacy, safety, real estate, environmental and zoning and occupancy laws, and other laws and regulations that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of our Galleries, outlets and warehouse facilities, in the United States, Canada and the U.K., as well as in jurisdictions from which we source our products. We believe we are in material compliance with laws applicable to our business.
