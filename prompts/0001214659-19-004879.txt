--------+---------

Our Company
 
Good Times Restaurants Inc., a Nevada corporation formed on October 6, 1996, operates and franchises Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants (“BDBB” or “Bad Daddy’s”) and Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard (“GTBFC” or “Good Times”) restaurants. Bad Daddy’s and Good Times are two distinctly different, yet complementary, restaurant concepts. Each is positioned as a high-quality brand within its respective segment of the industry. Bad Daddy’s is positioned at the upper end of the full-service casual theme restaurant segment and Good Times is positioned at the upper end of the quick-service restaurant segment.
 
Through our subsidiaries, as of December 6, 2018, we own, operate, franchise, or license a total of thirty-four BDBB restaurants in six different states. We own and operate twelve BDBB restaurants in Colorado, one BDBB restaurant in Oklahoma, thirteen BDBB restaurants in North Carolina, four BDBB restaurants in the greater Atlanta area, one BDBB restaurant in Chattanooga, Tennessee and one in Greenville, South Carolina. Of these restaurants, eight restaurants in North Carolina and South Carolina are operated through joint venture arrangements where we are the operating partner and own between 23% and 75% interest in the joint venture entities. We license the Bad Daddy’s brand for the BDBB restaurant located in the Charlotte Douglas International Airport which is owned and operated by a third- party licensee. One additional BDBB restaurant in Greenville, S.C. is operated by a third-party franchisee. We currently own and operate or franchise thirty-five total Good Times restaurants. Of these restaurants, thirty- three are in Colorado. Two of the restaurants are in Wyoming and are “dual brand” concept restaurants operated by a franchisee of both Good Times and Taco John’s.
 
The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” “Good Times” and similar terms refer to Good Times Restaurants Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Bad Daddy’s Franchise Development, LLC, Bad Daddy’s International, LLC, Good Times Drive-Thru Inc. (“Drive Thru”) and BD of Colorado, LLC. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, financial and operating data in this 10-K report reflect the consolidated business and operations of Good Times Restaurants Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 
Fiscal 2018 Financial & Brand Highlights
 

· | Our net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased by $20,160,000 (25.5%) to $99,240,000 from $79,080,000 in fiscal year 2017, primarily due to nine new Bad Daddy’s locations opened during the fiscal year ended September 25, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”) and a full year of operations for units opened during the fiscal year ended September 26, 2017 (“fiscal 2017”).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Bad Daddy’s brand had a 0.2% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2018. Adjusted for the impact of hurricane Florence, which had a significant impact in late September in our North Carolina restaurants, same store sales for the year would have increased 0.8%.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We opened nine Bad Daddy’s restaurants in fiscal 2018. We opened one Bad Daddy’s in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and plan to open a total of five to six Bad Daddy’s during the 2019 fiscal year.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Good Times brand has had eight consecutive years of same store sales growth.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent Developments
 
In September 2016, we entered into a $9,000,000 senior debt revolving line of credit with Cadence Bank to provide the necessary capital to fund future Bad Daddy’s and Good Times locations as well as fund the continued remodel of existing Good Times locations and recurring capital expenditures. In September 2017, we entered into an amendment to the senior debt revolving line of credit to increase the borrowing capacity to a total of $12,000,000. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2018, in October 2018, we entered into an amendment to the senior debt revolving line of credit to increase the borrowing capacity to a total of $17,000,000.

Concepts
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar operates in the emerging “small box” better burger casual dining segment and is an upscale, chef driven, full service, full bar concept.
 
There are three primary elements of the concept that we try and differentiate for our guests:
 

1. | Artfully Crafted Food. The menu consists of items made according to chef-driven recipes and with high quality ingredients that we believe have broad consumer appeal, yet are very distinctive within the upscale, casual dining segment. The menu is comprised of signature burgers, salads, sandwiches, and appetizers executed in unique flavor profiles. Regular “chef specials” are offered in each menu category that highlight unique flavor profiles whenever possible. Housemade sauces and dressings, a brioche bun, non-beef alternatives, including buffalo, tuna, turkey and chicken, and Create Your Own Burgers and Salads all help to differentiate Bad Daddy’s from other restaurants.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | A “Bad Ass Bar.” The food menu is complemented by a full bar that focuses on local, craft microbrew beers and specialty craft cocktails, with craft beers offered from several breweries that are local to each restaurant’s trade area. Two specialties are our Bad Daddy’s Amber Ale and our Bad Ass Margarita. Total alcoholic beverages account for approximately 15-20% of sales in our Bad Daddy’s restaurants.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Radical Hospitality. The restaurants have a high-energy yet family friendly environment with iconic, pop culture design elements and a personal, ultra-friendly and informal service platform. BDBB’s menu, service and environment are designed around a slightly irreverent brand personality, such as our Bad Ass Burger and Bad Ass Margarita menu items and the iconic Farrah Fawcett and Paul Newman Cool Hand Luke posters in the men’s and women’s restrooms. We have developed our own playlist of classic 1970’s to current classic rock n roll music that adds to the high energy atmosphere.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The quality positioning generates an average per person check of over $17, slightly above traditional bar and grill competitors such as Chili’s and Red Robin. The lunch daypart represents approximately 40% and the dinner daypart represents approximately 60% of restaurant sales, with restaurants opening daily at 11 am and closing generally between 10 pm and 11 pm, with restaurants open slightly later on weekends, depending on the surrounding trade area.
 
A typical BDBB restaurant is approximately 3,500-4,000 square feet with an enclosed patio, smaller than most other casual dining restaurants. Based on average annual restaurant sales of approximately $2.5 million (for restaurants open more than eighteen months), BDBB restaurants generate average sales per square foot of approximately $700, which we believe is a key metric indicating the strength and expansion potential of the concept. While sharing common design elements, each restaurant has unique features intended to create the impression that each Bad Daddy’s is local to its trade area and serves as a further point of differentiation from the larger casual dining chains. We believe BDBBs’ innovative menu and personalized service combined with a unique, fun restaurant design enhance our customers’ experience and differentiate BDBB from its competitors.
 
Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard
 
Good Times is an upscale, quick-service restaurant concept offering fresh, 100% all-natural, hand-crafted products. We operate 26 Good Times restaurants, and franchise an additional 9, located primarily in the Denver market and along the front range of Colorado. We believe Good Times is the only quick-service chain in our region, and one of a very few in the country, that offers a menu of fresh all-natural Angus beef and all-natural chicken from animals that are humanely raised and vegetarian fed without the use of added hormones, steroids, or antibiotics.
 
We compete primarily on the quality of our products and we believe that our menu items are consistent with the quality found at fast casual restaurants, with quick-service restaurant speed. Our brand positioning is based on “Taking a Better Food Stand” supported by the marketing headline “Happiness Made to Order” with three primary brand pillars of Innovation, Quality, and Connectedness. Within Innovation, we strive to create products and flavor profiles available only at Good Times and that challenge traditional quick-service restaurant norms. We communicate Quality throughout our menu, from our made-to-order items to our fresh, all-natural, handcrafted attributes. We strive for Connectedness with our customers based on strong emotional ties to our brand through social media, appealing to an outdoor and active lifestyle, promoting high quality ingredients, by building an irreverent yet approachable brand personality and through community support and involvement.
 
Our average per person check is approximately $8.00, which we believe is lower than the average check at fast casual hamburger concepts such as Habit Burger, Five Guys, and Smashburger, but higher than the typical quick-service restaurant average check. We do not offer a low-priced value menu like most national and multi-regional quick-service chains, choosing to define our value proposition based on a range of price choices within each of our menu categories and the quality of our food.

-


Good Times is primarily a drive-through concept, as all our restaurants have at least one drive-through lane. Many of our restaurants have no indoor seating and consist of one or two drive-through lanes and outdoor patio seating. Speed of service in this segment is critical for success and we average less than three-minute transaction times, as measured from the time the customer places their order until they leave the drive-through lane. Even in our restaurants that feature dine-in seating, a majority of our sales are conducted through the drive-thru lane.
 
The success of our strategy is evident in our strong same-store sales growth (sales growth over the prior year period at restaurants open more than 18 months, also referred to as comparable sales). Based on information from industry analysts and third-party publications, our growth in comparable restaurant sales has outperformed the quick-service restaurant industry average over the last eight years. Fiscal 2018’s same store sales growth of 4.2% followed comparable sales growth of 2.1% in fiscal 2017, 0.3% in fiscal 2016, 0.9% in fiscal 2015, 14.6% in 2014 and 11.9% growth in 2013.
 
Our Business Strengths
 
Our Brands Are Complementary.
 
While operating in different segments of the restaurant industry, our two brands share the following qualities:
 
Each is positioned at the upper end of its respective segment with the value proposition primarily driven by quality and uniqueness. Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar is an early entrant in the “small box” better burger casual dining segment. The menu contains chef-driven items with many made from scratch in our kitchens. Bad Daddy’s resonates with consumers by consistently executing high-quality menu items with unique flavor profiles that are delivered in a personalized, high-energy environment with a slightly irreverent brand personality.
 
We believe Good Times is the only quick-service chain in our region with an all-natural platform. We do not offer a dollar menu that many national chains do, choosing to compete on a market position emphasizing quality and uniqueness with a variety of price points across the menu and serving made-to-order products with quick-service restaurant speed of service.
 
Our Brands Have a Common Culture and Operating Philosophy.
 
While each of our brands is led by separate operating teams, each shares a commitment to four elements of success:
 

· | Values. Each brand focuses on developing behaviors and expectations around our core values of Integrity, Respect, Continued Improvement, and Fun.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | People. Each brand seeks to hire high quality people throughout and provide them with comprehensive training programs designed to ensure that they deliver consistently superior products and service. Each has an incentive program at the restaurant level based on balanced metrics that drive customer service, personnel development, and financial performance.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Distinctive quality. Each brand strives to offer unique, high quality menu items with distinctive taste profiles made with fresh, high quality ingredients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Excellent systems. Each brand takes a “best practices” approach, cross-pollinating the best ideas that are applicable to either brand. We seek to provide the best operating systems and processes to ease the administrative burden of management, enabling them to focus on leading their team members and operating their restaurants. Our philosophy is that systems and processes drive financial success and leadership serves as an example and motivating force to our crew members who interact with our guests, driving sales and customer loyalty.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Brands Share a Similar Customer Demographic.
 
Due to the common strategic focus on a quality positioning, both Good Times and Bad Daddy’s appeal to a slightly higher income, more upscale consumer demographic profile. However, there is little, if any, overlap between the brands in how consumers use them. Good Times is convenience-driven and operates in the quick-service restaurant segment with a $8.00 per person average check deriving the majority of its sales from the drive through occasion, while Bad Daddy’s provides a more destination-oriented, full service dining occasion with an average per person check of over $17.
Our Brands Have Growth Potential.
 
We believe both of our brands are well positioned to take advantage of consumers’ growing demand for restaurants with fresh, high-quality, all-natural products that offer fully customizable menu choices. Consumers want to know where their food comes from, want to be able to customize menu items to fit their individual preference and dining occasions, and place a higher value on perceived healthiness and on brands they can trust to execute on those attributes. We believe Good Times and Bad Daddy’s are both well positioned to capitalize on those macro-trends.

Both of our brands currently operate with relatively small market penetration and overall development footprints, providing significant expansion potential. As we further develop our markets, we expect to realize efficiencies in supervision and development and training of our employees, as well as economies of scale in our supply chain cost structure. It is our goal to grow relatively contiguously from our existing operating bases in order to maximize brand awareness and operating and distribution efficiencies.
 
Good Times and Bad Daddy’s operate with a common point-of-purchase system and we have implemented a common back office system for both brands. We are also continuing to invest in sophisticated digital training tools, making each brand’s restaurant level processes, systems, recipes and management tools available in one commonly accessible database.
 
We Have Assembled a Dedicated Management Team with Significant Experience.
 
Our core Good Times management team has worked together for over 20 years developing its concept and systems. Immediately after signing our license agreement to operate Bad Daddy’s restaurants in Colorado, we hired a team experienced in the management and development of full-service concepts to guide the growth of that brand and have since added experienced management and multi-unit leaders from other full-service brands.
 
Each of our brands are operated under separately dedicated management teams utilizing shared support services in administration, finance, accounting, human resources, development, marketing and information technology. We believe we have the processes and systems in place to support accelerated growth.
 
We Have Significant Operating Momentum.
 
Same-store sales at Good Times have increased eight consecutive years. Our compound same-store sales growth rate was approximately 45% from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2018. We believe this performance is largely the result of the evolution in our brand positioning, the re-imaging of several of our older restaurants, effective broadcast and social media marketing, and consistent execution of the customer experience. We plan to continue to re-image and remodel our remaining restaurants, innovate with new menu items in keeping with our brand strategy, and communicate our brand story to maintain our same-store sales growth.
 
The Bad Daddy’s concept was started in 2007 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Sales of the Bad Daddy’s restaurants which were open for at least 18 months averaged $2.5 million for the fifty-two weeks ended September 25, 2018. We opened nine restaurants during fiscal 2018 in addition to the six opened during fiscal 2017.
 
We believe that the strength of the Bad Daddy’s unit economic model provides us with significant expansion potential, both in our existing markets of the Southeastern U.S., and in new markets. We anticipate that most of our growth in the next two fiscal years will be in the Southeast and Midwest regions of the U.S.
 
Business Strategies
 
We are focused on continuing to improve the profitability of Drive Thru and developing additional Good Times restaurants in our home state of Colorado while developing the Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar concept with company-owned restaurants in Colorado, Oklahoma and North Carolina in addition to other markets in the U.S. We believe that there are significant opportunities to develop new units, grow customer traffic and increase awareness of our brands. The following sets forth the key elements of our growth strategy:

1. | Pursue disciplined growth of Company-operated Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants. We own the Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar brand, including all associated intellectual property. We have opened one new Bad Daddy’s restaurant subsequent to September 25, 2018 in Decatur, Georgia and have additional restaurants under development to open in fiscal 2019. We are in various stages of lease negotiation for additional sites for development in 2019 and 2020 as we continue our expansion primarily in the Southeast region of the country in fiscal 2019. We expect five to six openings in fiscal 2019, including the already opened restaurant in Georgia. We intend to follow a disciplined strategy of initially developing restaurants in other metropolitan areas in the Southeast and other regions of the country with favorable regulatory and legislative environments, and that meet our demographic, real estate and investment criteria in order to maximize management efficiencies, including multi-unit supervision, overall brand management, and product distribution.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that the broad appeal of Bad Daddy’s concept and the high-sales generated per square foot make it attractive to developers and provide us with the opportunity for continued expansion in other new markets across the country. We seek sites in upper middle-income suburban areas in proximity to upscale retail developments, theaters and high levels of daytime employment.
 

2. | Improve operational efficiencies and expense management. We continue to focus on managing our expenses in the operation of our restaurants and in our general and administrative functions, with a particular focus on cost of sales, labor and operating expense controls and efficiencies while not adversely impacting our overall quality and service proposition. Macroeconomic, state legislative increases to wages and other external factors have resulted in upward trends in certain of these operating costs. We have implemented multiple programs to mitigate the impact of these external factors including optimization of our supply and distribution channels, labor productivity tools and a new accounting software platform in fiscal 2017 for improved access to data by our restaurant operations teams. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to decline as a percentage of revenues as we continue to grow and as we gain further efficiencies in supervision and support services costs.

3. | Increase same-store sales in both brands. We intend to continue to focus on increasing our same-store sales. We plan to further strengthen our fresh, handcrafted, all-natural brand position at Good Times with menu innovation and targeted merchandising around each of our menu categories and focus around consumer price choice instead of deep discounts. We also expect to continue our broadcast advertising program while expanding our digital advertising and social media presence to elevate our online consumer facing conversation around the attributes of our all-natural platform for each of our core products. We intend to increase Bad Daddy’s same store sales through continual innovation in both ongoing menu engineering and chef-special limited time menu offerings that we believe drive increased customer visits as well as the per person average check. We also plan to promote our selection of 18 to 24 craft and local draft beers available at each restaurant and provide innovation in our craft cocktail lineup. Bad Daddy’s advertising is targeted to individual trade areas, community involvement and in-store, “four-wall” marketing activities that focus on optimizing the guests’ food, bar and service experience. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Expansion strategy and site selection
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar
 
Our development of the Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar concept in company-owned restaurants will focus on urban and suburban upper income demographic areas with median household incomes over $60,000, with a high concentration of daytime employment, upscale retail and movie theaters.  We believe the Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar concept has expansion potential in vibrant, growing, upper scale demographic markets, as additional restaurants are developed.
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar locations are primarily end-cap locations in new and existing shopping center developments using approximately 3,500 to 4,000 square feet.  While our Good Times restaurants are free standing and require extensive site development and entitlement processes, Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants can be developed much more quickly due to the requirement for only a building permit, signage approvals and liquor license without the need for extensive on- and off-site development or land and zoning submittals and modifications. We estimate that it will take approximately 100 to 120 days to develop a Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar from the time a building permit is issued. We expect that most, if not all, of the Company’s unit growth will be through the development of additional Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar locations.
 
Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard
 
We do not have explicit plans to develop additional Good Times restaurants, as we believe that our highest return on investment opportunity is through the development of Bad Daddy’s locations. However, we expect that any opportunistic development in Good Times locations would be through a lens of growth in Colorado and potentially surrounding states, which would preserve operating and marketing efficiencies created by the geographic concentration of our existing base of restaurants.
 
Any development of new Good Times restaurants will involve our new prototype restaurant design on sites that are on or adjacent to big box or grocery store anchored shopping centers or in high activity and employment areas.  Our site selection for new restaurants is oriented toward slightly higher income demographic areas than many of our urban locations and most of our targeted trade areas are in relatively high growth areas of the Denver and northern Colorado markets.
 
We lease all of our sites.  When we do purchase and develop a site, we intend to ultimately sell the developed site into the sale-leaseback market under a long-term lease. Our primary site objective is to secure a suitable site, with the decision to buy or lease as a secondary objective.  Our site selection process includes evaluating several criteria, including a mix of substantial daily traffic, density of at least 30,000 people within a three-mile radius, strong daytime population and employment base, retail and entertainment traffic generators, good visibility and easy access.
 
Restaurant locations
 
As of December 6, 2018, we operate, franchise or license a total of thirty-four Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar locations. The location in the Charlotte Douglas International Airport is operated pursuant to a License Agreement.
 
Additionally, we operate or franchise a total of thirty-five Good Times restaurants.

Menu
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar
 
We take great pride in offering a menu at Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar consisting of high quality, handcrafted all-Angus beef burgers with unique toppings such as buttermilk country-fried bacon, housemade American cheese, scratch made pesto and our specialty Bad Daddy’s sauce. The customizable menu options also include artisanal cheeses, tuna, turkey, buffalo and chicken sandwiches. We also offer recipe or customizable chopped salads, a full gluten free menu and regional menu items that incorporate local flavors. We also offer appetizers, hand-cut fries, housemade potato chips, hand-spun ice cream milk shakes and desserts. We offer a variety of craft beers from local breweries and a full bar serving spirits, cocktails, and wine.
