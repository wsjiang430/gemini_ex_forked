Item 1. Business.
OVERVIEW

UAS Drone Corp., a Nevada corporation (the Company, UAS, we, us, or similar terms), headquartered in Palm Beach, Florida, was founded in 2014 as Unlimited Aerial Systems, LLP (UAS LLP). We completed an Asset Purchase Agreement on March 31, 2015, purchasing all the assets and certain liabilities of UAS LLP in exchange for 600,000 shares of our common stock and our assumption of certain liabilities of UAS LLP. Our mailing address is 420 Royal Palm Way, Suite 100, Palm Beach, FL 33480, and our telephone number is 561-693-1424. Our web site address is www.uasdronecorp.com.
BUSINESS

We are a developer and manufacturer of commercial unmanned aerial systems, or drones, with the goal of providing a superior Quadrotor aerial platform at an affordable price point in the law enforcement and first responder markets.

In late 2016, we began working with a flight training company in the western U.S. We sent one of our inventory Quadrotors to them with the intention of: (1) allowing them to use our drone in their training courses, specifically with law enforcement and first responder professionals; (2) obtaining feedback on performance and operating characteristics of our drone with the intention of improving the product for future generations; and (3) seeking sales of additional Quadrotors to this company or its clients. During 2018, the Company did not sell any drones.

In October 2015, we entered into two agreements with Havis Inc., of Warminster, Pennsylvania, to provide manufacturing and distribution services for our products. Havis is an 80 year-old privately held, ISO 9001:2008 certified company that manufactures in-vehicle mobile computer and workflow solutions for public safety, public works government agencies and mobile professionals. Havis products are distributed through a nationwide network of resellers and sales representatives in the United States.

Under the Manufacturing Agreement, Havis will manufacture the Companys commercial drone products for the law enforcement sector in the United States. The agreement has a five-year term with successive three-year renewal terms, and lays out a framework for engineering, fulfillment of purchase orders, warehousing and other material terms.

Under the Distribution Agreement, the Company has appointed Havis as its distributor to the law enforcement sector in the United States for the Companys commercial drones. The agreement has a five-year term with successive three-year renewal terms, and provides a framework for development of marketing materials, warranty and service programs, training and risk mitigation, among other material terms. The agreement also provides for sales quotas to be established after the first year of sales, and Havis to brand all drones with its corporate name and logo. No pricing or margins are specified in the agreement.

Our agreements with Havis are currently on hold and may be terminated, as there has been no manufacturing of the drones nor development of marketing or service programs.

Emerging Growth Company

We are and we will remain an "emerging growth company" as defined under The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act), until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a "large accelerated filer" (with at least $700 million in public float) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). 

As an "emerging growth company", we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

· only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced Managements Discussion and Analysis disclosure;
 · reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;
 · no requirement that we hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and
 · exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.

We have taken advantage of some of these reduced burdens, and thus the information we provide stockholders may be different from what you might receive from other public companies in which you hold shares.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a smaller reporting company, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a smaller reporting company, at such time as we cease being an emerging growth company, the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company.  Specifically, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports.
