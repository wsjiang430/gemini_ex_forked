Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Aspen Aerogels, Inc. is an aerogel technology company that designs, develops and manufactures innovative, high-performance aerogel insulation used primarily in the energy infrastructure and building materials markets. The Company also conducts research and development related to aerogel technology supported by funding from several agencies of the U.S. government and other institutions. When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” refer to Aspen Aerogels, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 We design, develop and manufacture innovative, high-performance aerogel insulation. We believe our aerogel blankets deliver the best thermal performance of any widely used insulation product available on the market today and provide a combination of performance attributes unmatched by traditional insulation materials. Our products provide two to five times the thermal performance of widely used traditional insulation in a thin, easy-to-use and durable blanket form. Our end-use customers select our products where thermal performance is critical, and to save money, improve resource efficiency, enhance sustainability, preserve operating assets and protect workers.
 Our technologically advanced products are targeted at the estimated $3.1 billion annual global market for energy infrastructure insulation materials. Our aerogel insulation has undergone rigorous technical validation and is used by many of the world’s largest oil producers and the owners and operators of refineries, petrochemical plants, liquefied natural gas facilities and power generating and distribution assets, such as ExxonMobil, PTT LNG, Dominion Resources and Royal Dutch Shell. Our products replace traditional insulation in existing facilities during regular maintenance, upgrades and capacity expansions. In addition, our aerogel products are increasingly being specified for use in new-build energy infrastructure facilities.
 We introduced our two key product lines, Pyrogel and Cryogel in 2008. Our product revenue has grown from $17.2 million in 2008 to $102.1 million in 2018, representing a ten year compound annual growth rate of 19%. During this period, we have sold more than $821 million of our products globally, representing an installed base of more than 313 million square feet of insulation. We believe that this decade of success positions us for future growth and continued gain in market share.
 We currently focus our commercial efforts in the energy infrastructure market, where we believe our products have multiple high value applications. We also market and sell aerogel products for use within the building materials and other end markets. Customers in these markets use our products for applications as diverse as wall systems, military and commercial aircraft, trains, buses, appliances, apparel, footwear and outdoor gear. As we continue to enhance our aerogel technology platform, we believe we will have opportunities to address additional high value applications in the global insulation market and in a diverse set of new markets.
 We have grown our business by forming technical and commercial relationships with industry leaders, which has allowed us to optimize our products to meet the particular demands of targeted market sectors. We have benefited from our technical and commercial relationships with ExxonMobil in the oil refinery and petrochemical sector, with TechnipFMC in the offshore oil sector and with BASF in the building materials market. We will continue our strategy of working with innovative companies to target and penetrate additional market opportunities.
 Our patented aerogel product and manufacturing technologies are significant assets. Aerogels are complex structures in which 97% of the volume consists of air trapped between intertwined clusters of amorphous silica solids. These extremely low density solids provide superior insulating properties. Although aerogels are usually fragile materials, we have developed innovative and proprietary manufacturing processes that enable us to produce industrially robust aerogel insulation cost-effectively and at commercial scale.
 Our products help customers to improve the resource efficiency and sustainability of their operations. Our products also enable compact system design, reduce installation time and costs, promote freight and logistics cost savings, reduce system weight and required storage space and enhance job site safety. Our products reduce the incidence of corrosion under insulation, which is a significant maintenance cost and safety issue in energy infrastructure facilities. Many of our products also offer strong fire protection, which is a critical performance requirement in our markets. We believe our array of product attributes provides strong competitive advantages over traditional insulation. Although competing insulation materials may have one or more comparable attributes, we believe that no single insulation material currently available offers all of the properties of our aerogel insulation products.
 Total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $104.4 million, $111.6 million and $117.7 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, based on shipment destination or research services location, our U.S. revenue was $41.7 million, $51.4 million and $35.7 million, respectively, and our international revenue was $62.6 million, $60.2 million and $82.0 million, respectively.

We manufacture our products using proprietary and patent-protected technology at our facility in East Providence, Rhode Island. We have operated the East Providence facility since 2008 and have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and productivity since that date. We commenced operation of our third production line in the East Providence facility in 2015 which increased our annual nameplate capacity to 50 million square feet of aerogel blankets. In 2018, we initiated a series of projects designed to increase this nameplate capacity by 20 percent to 60 million square feet of aerogel blankets by the end of 2020. As of December 31, 2018, we had increased the nameplate capacity in our East Providence facility to 55 million square feet of aerogel blankets. 
 Financial information about our product and research services revenues, net loss per share and our total assets are provided in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Our Markets and Competition
 Our core market is the energy infrastructure insulation market. This market is global, well-established and includes large and well-capitalized end-users. This market includes companies operating refinery, petrochemical, oil production, and LNG production and storage facilities. The market also includes firms operating gas, coal, nuclear, hydro and solar thermal power generating plants and district energy systems. Insulation systems in the energy infrastructure market are designed to maintain hot and cold process equipment, piping and storage tanks at optimal temperatures, to protect plant and equipment from the elements and from the risk of fire, and to protect workers. The market is served by a well-organized, well-established, worldwide network of distributors, contractors and engineers.
 Demand for insulation in the energy infrastructure market is composed of demand associated with new-build construction of facilities, capital expansions and related capital projects, as well as with routine, non-discretionary maintenance programs within existing facilities. Capital expansions and related capital projects in the energy infrastructure market are driven primarily by overall economic growth and projected growth in energy demand. Maintenance programs are essential to optimal operation of process equipment, to protect workers and to minimize the risk of a catastrophic loss. Accordingly, we believe that demand for insulation for maintenance purposes in comparison to capital projects is less affected by volatility associated with economic cycles, energy prices and other macroeconomic factors.
 The major end-use markets that drive demand for our products include oil refining, petrochemical, natural gas and LNG production and storage, onshore oil production, offshore oil production and power generation. Global energy demand is expected to increase in the long-term and, in order to serve this growing demand, we believe our end-use customers will continue to invest in major energy infrastructure projects.
 We also sell our products for use in the building materials and other end markets, including for the fabrication of insulation parts by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. These OEMs develop products incorporating our aerogel blankets for applications as diverse as military and commercial aircraft, trains, buses, appliances, apparel, footwear and outdoor gear. While these are not presently our core markets, we anticipate that we will allocate a growing portion of our manufacturing capacity to serve these markets in the long term. We believe the key performance criteria for insulation in these markets and applications include thermal performance, compact design, durability and fire resistance.
 We operate in a highly competitive environment. In general, we compete with traditional insulation materials based on product performance, price, availability and proximity to the customer. Customers may choose among a variety of insulation materials that offer a range of characteristics including thermal performance, durability, vapor permeability, moisture resistance, ease of installation and upfront and lifecycle costs. Within each type of insulation material, there is also competition between the manufacturers of that material. Most types of traditional insulation materials are produced by a number of different manufacturers and once customers have chosen the type of insulation material that they intend to use, they will choose a manufacturer of that material based primarily on each manufacturer’s price and delivery schedule. Insulation manufacturers include a range of large, high-volume, multinational manufacturers offering branded products and strong technical support services to small, low-volume, local manufacturers offering low prices and limited customer support.
 We believe the primary competitive factors in our market are:
  
• | product performance (along multiple criteria), quality and fitness for purpose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product price, installed cost and lifecycle cost;
--+--------------------------------------------------

 4
 
 
• | product availability; and
--+--------------------------


• | proximity to customer and logistics.
--+-------------------------------------

 Our products are priced at a premium to traditional insulation materials. While our competitors offer many traditional insulation products that are priced below our products on a per-unit basis, we believe our products have superior performance attributes and may have the lowest cost on a fully-installed basis or offer significant life-cycle cost savings.
 We compete in the aerogel insulation market with Cabot Corporation, Armacell International S.A., Guangdong Alison Hi-Tech Co., Ltd. and Nano Tech Co., Ltd. and a growing number of other competitors that manufacture and sell aerogel insulation products. We expect to face increasing competition in the aerogel insulation market over the next several years as existing competitors and new entrants seek to develop and market their own aerogel products. In addition to other aerogel insulation products, we also encounter competition from innovatively packaged traditional insulation materials that compete with our products on the basis of one or more performance factors. 
 Within each of our target markets, we encounter one or more of these organizations or their resellers and a significant number of other aggressive national, regional and local suppliers of traditional insulation products. Our competitors are seeking to enhance traditional insulation materials and to develop and introduce new and emerging insulation technologies. Competing technologies that outperform our insulation products in one or more performance attributes could be developed and successfully introduced. See “Risk Factors —The energy infrastructure insulation market is highly competitive; if we are unable to compete successfully, we may not be able to increase or maintain our market share and revenues.”
 Our market share in 2018 was approximately 3% of the estimated $3.1 billion annual global market for energy infrastructure insulation materials. Many of our competitors have greater market presence, larger market share, longer operating histories, stronger name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other resources than we have and may be better able to withstand volatility within the industry and throughout the economy as a whole while retaining greater operating and financial flexibility. If our competitors lower their prices, or develop new products with better performance, or if we are unable to compete effectively, our growth opportunities, share of the market, margins and profitability may decline.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 Because insulation is used in a wide variety of demanding applications, insulation materials must satisfy a wide range of performance criteria on a cost-effective basis. We believe that our aerogel technology has allowed us to create superior insulation products for our core markets that will allow us to continue to grow our share of the global insulation market. We believe that the potential for significant technological innovation in traditional insulation materials is limited and that new high-performance materials will be required to meet evolving market requirements for energy efficient insulation systems. Our line of high-performance aerogel blankets is positioned to meet these requirements. Our solution is driven by our innovative and proprietary technology that produces aerogels in a flexible and industrially robust blanket form and is supported by over 20 years of research and development dedicated to new aerogel compositions, form factors and manufacturing technologies. We believe our aerogel blankets deliver a superior combination of performance attributes that enable end-users to save money, improve resource efficiency, preserve operating assets and protect workers across a wide range of applications in our target markets.
 We believe the following combination of capabilities distinguishes us from our competitors and positions us to continue to gain market share in the energy infrastructure insulation market:
  
• | Disruptive Products with a Compelling Value Proposition. Our aerogel products provide two to five times the thermal performance of widely used traditional insulation in a thin, easy-to-use and durable blanket form. We believe our array of product attributes provides strong competitive advantages over traditional insulation and will enable us to gain a larger share of the energy infrastructure insulation market. Although competing insulation materials may have one or more comparable attributes, we believe that no single insulation material currently available offers all of the properties of our aerogel insulation.

• | Proven, Scalable Business Model. Our proprietary manufacturing technology is proven and has been successfully scaled up to meet increasing demand. We have operated the East Providence facility since 2008 and have significantly increased manufacturing capacity and productivity during the period. We successfully commenced operation of our second production line at this facility in March 2011 and doubled our annual nameplate capacity to 40 million square feet of aerogel blankets. We commenced operations of a third line in the East Providence facility during the first quarter of 2015 which increased our annual nameplate capacity by 25% to 50 million square feet of aerogel blankets. During 2018, we initiated a series of projects, which we refer to as EP20, designed to increase this nameplate capacity to 60 million square feet of aerogel blankets by the end of 2020. During 2018, we implemented the first phase of EP20 and increased the nameplate capacity in our East Providence facility to 55 million square feet of aerogel blankets.

Our Products
 Aerogels are highly porous structures in which 97% of the volume consists of air trapped between intertwined clusters of amorphous silica solids. Aerogels are a very low density solids and are extremely fragile materials. However, our proprietary manufacturing process produces aerogels in a flexible, resilient, durable and easy-to-use blanket form.
 The core raw material in the production of our aerogel products is silica precursors. Our manufacturing process initially creates a semi-solid alcogel in which the silica structure is filled with ethanol. We produce aerogel by means of a supercritical extraction 
 7
 
process that removes ethanol from the gel and replaces it with air. Our process allows the ethanol to be extracted without causing the solid matrix in the gel to collapse from capillary forces.
 Our material costs were 47%, 45% and 41% of product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We are seeking to lower our manufacturing costs and to improve the per square foot costs of our aerogel blankets by optimizing our formulations to reduce material costs, by enhancing manufacturing process controls to improve yields, by realizing price reductions from existing vendors, by qualifying new vendors and by reducing shipping costs. Our objective is both to reduce costs to enhance our competitive position and to ensure we deliver high quality products to our customers.
 The materials used in the production of our products consist primarily of several silica precursors, fiber batting, and other additives. The markets for these materials are generally competitive and multiple sources of supply exist for all of our raw materials. However, during 2018, we experienced a significant increase in the price of certain silica precursors due to a supply imbalance in the silanes market. We are actively working to reformulate our products to reduce our reliance on the materials that are susceptible to significant price fluctuations.
 We purchase silica precursors from several suppliers. Based on the current level of demand for our products, we believe that an adequate long-term supply of silica precursors is available. However, if demand for our products increases rapidly, we will need to work with suppliers to ensure that an adequate long-term supply of silica precursors will be available at competitive prices. Suppliers of silica precursors include industrial companies that produce the materials directly or that produce them as a byproduct of other industrial processes. We are working with a number of these suppliers to plan for our potential future needs and to develop our processes to reduce the long-term cost impact of these materials. See “Risk Factors — Shortages of the raw materials used in the production of our products, increases in the cost of such materials or disruptions in our supply chain could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.”
 Our aerogel blankets are reinforced with fiber batting. We manufacture and sell our blankets in 60 inch wide, three foot diameter rolls with a standard range of thickness of 5 millimeters to 10 millimeters. Our base products are all flexible, hydrophobic, vapor permeable, compression resistant and able to be cut and fabricated using conventional tools. We have specifically developed our line of aerogel blankets to meet the requirements of a broad set of applications within our target markets. The composition and attributes of our standard aerogel blankets are described below:

 R-Values by Material
 Insulation is a material or combination of materials that slows the transfer of heat from one side of the material to the other. The composition of our aerogel products minimizes the three mechanisms of thermal transport:
  
• | Conduction. Heat conduction through a material is correlated to the material’s density. Aerogels are very low density solids. As a result, thermal conductivity through the aerogel material itself is extremely low.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convection. Heat convection in gases is through movement of gas molecules. Due to the restricted movement of gases in the aerogel structure, thermal convection is eliminated inside the aerogels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Radiation. Radiation requires no medium to transfer the heat. Thermal radiation is partially absorbed by aerogels. Our aerogel products also contain infrared absorbing additives to significantly reduce radiant heat transfer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe our aerogel products offer the lowest levels of thermal conductivity, or best insulating performance, of any widely used insulation available on the market today.
 The lower a material’s thermal conductivity, the more slowly heat is transferred through the material. R-values are a commonly used measure of an insulating material’s resistance to heat transfer. R-value is calculated as the thickness of an insulation material divided by the thermal conductivity of the insulation material. Materials with higher R-values have lower thermal conductivity and are better insulators. Traditional and specialty insulation materials provide a range of R-values. Aerogels have the highest R-value per unit of thickness in comparison to traditional insulation materials.
 Qualification for Use
 Our products have undergone rigorous testing and are now qualified for global usage in both routine maintenance and in capital projects at many of the world’s largest oil producers, refiners and petrochemical companies. These end-users of our products have well defined practices, codes, specification and standards for materials and systems installed or used in their facilities. These specifications include insulation system design standards, material qualification and selection processes, and insulation application practices. As part of the material qualification process established by these companies, a new insulation product must meet general industry standards, such as consensus standards developed by ASTM International, and, in some cases, company-specific internal standards to be considered for use. In addition, most of these companies require one or more field trials to evaluate fitness for use in specific applications. The companies either run these qualification processes and field trials internally or through third parties engaged by them, and they generally do not publicly disclose the results of their testing. While the specific processes and timelines vary from company to company, in general, upon successful completion of the qualification process for an insulation product, an end-user will typically deem the product to be qualified for use in its facilities on a local, regional or global basis for one or more applications. Because our end-use customers are typically businesses with very large operations in multiple sites, our insulation sales likely represent only a small portion of the total insulation used by any one of these companies. Accordingly, once our products are qualified at a company, we continue to seek to expand use of our products by the end-use customer in additional applications and at multiple locations.

We have established a network of insulation distributors to ensure rapid delivery of our products in critical regions. Our sales personnel work to educate insulation contractors about the technical and operating cost advantages of aerogel blankets. Our sales force also works directly with end-users and engineering firms to promote qualification, specification and wider acceptance of our products in existing and new applications. In the energy infrastructure market, we rely heavily on the existing and well-established channel of distributors and contractors to deliver products to our customers. In addition, our sales personnel work with OEMs and strategic partners to create new products and solutions to expand our market reach.
 The sales cycle for a new insulation material is typically lengthy. Our sales cycle from initial customer trials to widespread use can take from one to three years, although we typically realize increasing revenue at each stage in the cycle. We believe our relationships with technically sophisticated customers and strategic partners serve to validate our technology, products and value proposition within a target market. These relationships have proven to accelerate the sales cycle with other customers within specific markets and to facilitate growth in market share. We have focused our marketing efforts on developing technical support materials, installation guides, case studies and general awareness of the superior performance of our aerogel blankets. We rely principally on our website, social media, printed technical materials, participation in industry conferences and tradeshows and presentation of technical papers to communicate our message to existing and potential customers. We also receive strong word-of-mouth support from the growing network of distributors, installation contractors, OEMs, strategic partners and end-users that understand the benefits of our products.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 48 sales and marketing professionals worldwide. Their efforts were supported by a team of ten sales consultants.
 Our Customers and End-Users
 Customers
 Our primary customers are distributors, installation contractors and OEMs that stock, install and fabricate insulation products, components and systems for technically sophisticated end-users that require high-performance insulation.

• | Distributors: We currently operate through a global network of 70 insulation distributors. In general, insulation distributors stock, sell and distribute aerogel materials to insulation contractors and end-users. The distribution of our product outside the United States is often conducted under agreements that provide for exclusivity by geography linked to annual purchase volume minimums. These insulation distributors typically market, promote and advertise our aerogel materials across their market.

Building Materials and Other Markets
 Traditionally, we have relied on the efforts of a small network of partners, OEMs and fabrication houses to serve the building materials, transportation, apparel and appliance markets. These partners, OEMs and fabricators are manufacturers of components and systems for buildings, refrigerated and hot appliances, cold storage equipment, automobiles, aircraft, trains and electronic sectors and manufacturers of outdoor gear and apparel. In addition, we have partnered with BASF to develop and commercialize innovative products optimized to meet the needs of the building materials market. The end-users of our products in these markets include a wide range of institutions, businesses, individuals, municipalities and government agencies.
Manufacturing
 We manufacture our products using our proprietary technology at our facility located in East Providence, Rhode Island. We have operated the East Providence facility since 2008 and have significantly increased manufacturing capacity and productivity during the period. Our manufacturing process is proven, scalable and can meet increasing demand.
 Our manufacturing group is led by a seasoned team with management experience at global industrial and specialty chemical companies. Our manufacturing workforce is skilled and, to date, we have experienced employee turnover consistent with our industry. 
 11
 
We have well-defined operating processes and maintenance, environmental, health and safety programs to support our operations. We employ statistical processes and quality controls in our manufacturing systems. We measure and monitor thermal conductivity, hydrophobicity and other key properties of our aerogel blankets in our manufacturing operations. We are ISO 9001:2015 certified.
 We successfully commenced operation of our third production line at the East Providence facility in 2015, which increased our annual nameplate capacity to 50 million square feet of aerogel blankets. We have initiated a series of projects, which we refer to as EP20, designed to increase the nameplate capacity of the East Providence facility by an additional 10 million square feet of aerogel blankets by the end of 2020. During 2018, we completed EP20 projects at a cost of $3 million that increased our nameplate capacity to 55 million square feet. We estimate the cost to complete the remaining EP20 projects will be up to $12 million. The EP20 projects are designed to improve manufacturing productivity and capital efficiency through a phased deployment of enhanced chemical and process technologies. 
 We directly control all stages in the manufacture of our aerogel blankets. Our direct ownership of manufacturing operations allows us to maintain control of proprietary process technologies and to control product quality. Our production of aerogel blankets utilizes a continuous process and consists of the following key steps:
  
• | Sol Preparation. Mixing of silica precursors in ethanol, a catalyst and additives in set formulas to deliver the target properties of the resultant aerogel.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Casting. Combination of the sol and fiber batting and initial formation of the gel structure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aging. Bathing of the gel blankets in fluids to impart desired physical and thermal properties.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extraction. Supercritical extraction of the ethanol liquid from the gel blanket to produce a dried aerogel blanket.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Heat Treatment. Drying to remove trace ethanol, salts and water from the aerogel blankets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Finishing. Coating to enhance quality and product handling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quality Control. Utilizing statistical process and quality controls to measure thermal conductivity, hydrophobicity and other key properties of our aerogel blankets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our material costs were 47%, 45% and 41% of product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 The materials used in the production of our products consist primarily of a several silica precursors, fiber batting, and other additives. The markets for these materials are generally competitive and multiple sources of supply exist for all of our raw materials. However, during 2018, we experienced a significant increase in the price of certain silica precursors due to a supply imbalance in the silanes market. We are actively working to reformulate our products to reduce our reliance on materials that are susceptible to significant price fluctuations.
 We purchase silica precursors from several suppliers. Based on the current level of demand for our products, we believe that an adequate long-term supply of silica precursors is available. However, if demand for our products increases rapidly, we will need to work with suppliers to ensure that the long-term supply of silica precursors will be available at competitive prices. Suppliers of silica precursors include industrial companies that produce the materials directly or that produce them as a byproduct of other industrial processes. We are working with a number of suppliers to plan for our potential future needs and to develop our processes to reduce the long-term cost impact of these materials. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy — Shortages of the raw materials used in the production of our products, increases in the cost of such materials or disruptions in our supply chain could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.”
 We are seeking to lower our manufacturing costs and to improve the per square foot costs of our aerogel blankets by optimizing our formulations to reduce material costs, by enhancing manufacturing process controls to improve yields, by realizing price reductions from existing vendors, by qualifying new vendors and by reducing shipping costs. In addition, we believe additional opportunities to realize production efficiencies and to reduce per unit overhead costs will arise with growth in the scale of our manufacturing operations. Our objective is both to reduce costs to enhance our competitive advantage and to ensure we deliver high quality finished products to our customers. 
 Research and Development
 The mission of our research and development team is to leverage our aerogel technology platform in support of our commercial objectives. In our existing markets, research and development personnel design new and improved insulation products to enhance our 
 12
 
value to customers and to expand our revenue potential. Our materials scientists and engineers also seek to develop enhanced chemical and process technologies to improve yields, lower manufacturing costs and improve product performance. In new markets, research and development personnel seek to exploit the unique characteristics of aerogels, including low thermal conductivity, high surface area, high electrical conductivity, and tunable porosity, to develop aerogel enhanced products and next generation technology addressing complex and unmet market needs. 
 Our research and development expenditures were $6.3 million, $6.2 million and $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, we spent $1.0 million, $0.9 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, on research and development activities sponsored by federal and other government agencies. 
 Contract Research and Government Support
 We regularly seek funding from a number of federal and other government agencies in support of our research and development and manufacturing activities. Research performed under contract to the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and other institutions allows us to develop and leverage technologies into broader commercial applications. We also work closely with customers in government and industry to develop potential aerogel solutions that leverage not only the thermal insulation performance but other benefits of aerogels as well. The research and development activities that we conduct under such contracts may produce intellectual property to which we may not have ownership or exclusive rights and will be unable to protect or monetize.
 Under our contracts, the U.S. government generally has the right not to exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may modify, curtail or terminate the contracts at its convenience. Our government customers may not renew our existing contracts after the conclusion of their terms and we may not be able to enter into new contracts with U.S. government agencies. Any decision by the U.S. government not to exercise contract options or to modify, curtail or terminate our contracts or not to renew our contracts or enter into new contracts with us would adversely affect our revenues.
 We have received $55.9 million in funding under government contracts from inception through December 31, 2018. Our contract research revenue was $2.2 million, $2.0 million and $2.2 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights that cover our aerogel technology platform, including, product forms, applications and/or manufacturing technologies and the technology or know-how that enables these product forms, applications, technologies and specifications, to avoid and defend against claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and to prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Since aerogels were developed more than 80 years ago, there has been a wide range of research, development and publication on aerogels and related technologies, which make it difficult to establish intellectual property rights to many key elements of aerogel technology and to obtain meaningful patent protection. Where appropriate, we seek to protect our rights by filing patent applications in United States and other key foreign jurisdictions related to products, processes, technology and improvements that we consider patentable and important to our business and, in particular, our aerogel technology, product forms and their applications in promising markets and our manufacturing technologies. We also rely on trade secrets, trademarks, licensing agreements, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and continuing technological innovation to safeguard our intellectual property rights and develop and maintain our competitive edge.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we owned 40 issued U.S. patents, 23 pending U.S. patent applications (including five issued U.S. patents and three pending U.S. patent application that we co-own with third parties), 79 issued foreign patents and 78 pending foreign patent applications (including 18 issued foreign patents and 20 pending foreign patent applications that we co-own with third parties). The patents that we own are generally effective for 20 years from the filing date of the earliest application to which each U.S. patent claims priority. The scope of each of our foreign patents varies in accordance with local law. Our early product patents start to expire in December 2021.
 In May, 2016, we filed a complaint for patent infringement against Nano Tech Co., Ltd., or Nano, and Guangdong Alison Hi-Tech., Ltd., or Alison, and together with Nano, the Respondents, in the United States International Trade Commission, or the ITC. The ITC complaint alleged that these two China-based companies have engaged and are engaging in unfair trade practices by importing aerogel products in the United States that infringe, and/or are manufactured by processes that infringe, several of our patents in violation of Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. In the ITC complaint, we sought exclusion orders from the ITC that direct the United States Customs and Border Protection to stop the importation of these infringing products. In June 2016, the ITC instituted an investigation based on our complaint. In September 2017, the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) presiding over the ITC investigation issued an Initial Determination finding that Alison and Nano have infringed our patents relating to aerogel insulation and/or methods 
 13
 
of manufacturing aerogel insulation. As part of the Initial Determination, the ALJ found that Alison and Nano infringed all of the patent claims asserted against each of them across the three asserted patents, and that Alison and Nano failed to prove the asserted claims were invalid. The ALJ also recommended a limited exclusion order as a remedy to prevent the importation of infringing aerogel products into the United States. In February 2018, the ITC issued its final determination confirming the ALJ’s infringement and validity determinations except with respect to one dependent product claim where the ITC found the claim not infringed. The ITC also revised some of the ALJ’s claim constructions. However, the ITC affirmed that Alison and Nano have each violated Section 337 of the Tariff Act and issued a limited exclusion order prohibiting importation of infringing aerogel insulation products manufactured by Alison and Nano. The exclusion order, enforced by United States Customs and Border Protection, is currently in effect. Alison has sought an appeal of ITC’s finding that a product composition patent asserted by us against Alison is valid and infringed. As neither respondents appealed the ITC findings of validity or infringement with respect to asserted process patents, the exclusion order remains valid and enforced irrespective of the outcome of the current appeal. In addition to Respondents’ contention at the ITC that the asserted patents were invalid, Alison also filed petitions with United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, requesting Inter-Partes Review to cancel certain claims in three of Aspen’s manufacturing process patents and one product patent. A three member panel of Administrative Patent Judges at the USPTO denied all of Alison’s petitions to institute Inter-Partes Review challenging the validity of these Aspen patents. Alison has also filed similar requests with the Chinese Patent Office, or SIPO, seeking to invalidate two of our Chinese manufacturing process patents and two of our Chinese product patents. After the conclusion of the oral proceedings and before any decision issued by the SIPO, Alison withdrew all of its requests for invalidation of our Chinese patents.
 
In May 2018, Alison filed another request seeking to invalidate one of our manufacturing process patents at SIPO. After conducting an oral proceeding in September 2018, the Patent Reexamination Board of SIPO, or PRB, issued a decision in October 2018 holding Aspen’s issued patent as amended to be valid. The decision by the PRB is subject to an appeal to the Beijing IP court. In 2018, a reseller of Nano’s products in Taiwan challenged the validity of one of our patents in Taiwan. After reviewing our response submissions, the Taiwan patent office determined that our patent as granted is valid and dismissed the challenge. In late 2018, LG Chem Ltd has challenged the validity of one of our process patents in Korea. The ensuing proceedings are ongoing. We expect to face additional such challenges in the coming years as the interest for our products grows around the world. 
 In April 2016, we filed a patent infringement suit at the District Court in Mannheim, Germany against the Respondents and two European resellers asserting their infringement of one of our German patents. We subsequently asserted infringement of another three patents against Nano and a European reseller of Alison’s products at the Mannheim court. We subsequently settled with one of the European resellers in exchange for a commitment not to procure infringing products and cooperation with our case. In January 2018, the court issued a series of judgments by acknowledgement (German, “Anerkenntnisurteil”) finding the second reseller, Hiltex Techniche Weefsels b.v., or Hiltex, liable for infringement and issued injunctions against Hiltex. The judgments resulted from a settlement agreement whereby Hiltex agreed not to resell infringing products in Europe where at least one of the asserted patents is active. Nano and Alison also initiated a nullity actions in German Federal Patent Court against our asserted German patents. The German Federal Patent Court conducted an oral proceeding with respect to one patent in September 2018 and determined that the patent is valid as originally issued and dismissed the challenge to its validity. Alison and Nano likewise filed an opposition to one of the asserted patents at the European Patent Office, or EPO, in which EPO revoked the patent on formality grounds. Such determination is subject to an appeal to the EPO Board of appeals. Our infringement litigation against Alison and Nano remains ongoing with respect to the earlier asserted patent while the Mannheim court stayed the proceedings involving subsequently asserted patents pending resolution of the nullity actions.
 Due to their nature, it is difficult to predict the outcome or the costs involved in any litigation. Furthermore, the Respondents may have significant resources and interest to litigate and therefore, these litigation matters could be protracted and may ultimately involve significant legal expenses. We have incurred approximately $8.1 million of expenses related to this litigation through December 31, 2018. In addition to the foregoing, we have been and may be from time to time party to other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business and to other patent enforcement actions to assert our patent rights.
 We believe that having distinctive names is an important factor in marketing our products, and therefore we use trademarks to brand some of our products, including Pyrogel, Cryogel and Spaceloft. As of December 31, 2018, we had five trademark registrations in the United States, one trademark registration with the World Intellectual Property Organization, and 49 trademark registrations in foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and Brazil. Although we have a foreign trademark registration program for selected marks, our approach may not be comprehensive and we may not be able to register or use such marks in each foreign country in which we seek registration.
 Cross License Agreement with Cabot Corporation
 In April 2006, we entered into a cross license agreement with Cabot Corporation, as amended in September 2007, in which each party granted certain intellectual property rights to the other party. The cross license agreement remains in effect until the expiration of 
 14
 
the last to expire of the issued patents or patent applications and acquired patents licensed thereunder. We hold a non-exclusive, worldwide license to those patents and patent applications owned or licensed by Cabot that are necessary for us to (i) practice our manufacturing technology within a field of use, which is defined in accordance with the specific chemistry of our aerogel products and the supercritical fluid technology that we use in our manufacturing technology and (ii) use and sell the resulting aerogel blanket and derivative products. We paid Cabot $38 million over a period of approximately seven years, with the last payment made in March 2013, in connection with this license agreement. We have granted to Cabot a reciprocal, non-exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents and patent applications that we own that are necessary for Cabot to practice its processes within a field of use defined in accordance with the specific chemistry in its aerogel products and the drying technology that it uses to manufacture its products. The grant of license to each party covers issued patents, patent applications and patents issued from such counterpart applications, as well as patents licensed or acquired during a specified period, in each case that claim aerogels, or methods, materials of manufacture, or uses of aerogels.
 Our Company
 We are a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware. In June 2008, we completed a reorganization pursuant to which our predecessor company merged with and into a newly formed Delaware corporation, renamed Aspen Aerogels, Inc. We own three wholly owned subsidiaries: Aspen Aerogels Rhode Island, LLC, Aspen Aerogels Germany, GmbH and Aspen Aerogels Georgia, LLC, which was formed in August 2016. We maintain our corporate offices in Northborough, Massachusetts.
 On June 18, 2014, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, of 7,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $11.00 per share. As of March 7, 2019, we had 24,246,807 shares of our common stock outstanding.
 We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. SEC filings are available at the SEC’s website at https://www.sec.gov.
 We maintain a public website at https://www.aerogel.com and use our website as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Our website includes an Investors section through which we make available, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed on behalf of directors and executive officers, as well as any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 295 full-time employees and one part-time employee, with 34 in research and development, 187 in manufacturing operations and supply chain, 48 in sales and marketing and 26 in general and administrative functions. Of our employees, 283 are located in the United States and twelve are located abroad. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be of good standing. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or have collective bargaining agreements.
Seasonality
 Our industry and product offering makes us less susceptible to seasonal patterns as our operating results are generated in part by demand for insulation associated with new-build construction of facilities, capital expansions and related capital projects, and larger maintenance-related projects in the energy infrastructure market. Historically, our second and fourth quarter results have shown increased levels of revenue, which we believe is associated with our end-use customers’ maintenance schedules and timing of capital projects.

Environmental Matters
 We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. We believe that our policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and associated financial liability. To date, environmental control regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on our overall operations. See “Risk Factors — We may incur significant costs complying with environmental, health and safety laws and related claims, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.”
