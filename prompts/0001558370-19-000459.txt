     Item 1. Business 
     GENERAL
     We are a national solutions provider of a wide range of information technology, or IT, solutions. We help our customers design, enable, manage, and service their IT environments. We provide IT products, including computer systems, data center solutions, software and peripheral equipment, networking communications, and other products and accessories that we purchase from manufacturers, distributors, and other suppliers. We also offer services involving design, configuration, and implementation of IT solutions. These services are performed by our personnel and by third-party providers. We have three operating segments, which serve primarily: (a) small- to medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, in our Business Solutions segment, through our PC Connection Sales subsidiary, (b) large enterprise customers, in our Enterprise Solutions segment, through our MoreDirect subsidiary, and (c) federal, state, and local government and educational institutions, in our Public Sector Solutions segment, through our GovConnection subsidiary. Financial results for each of our segments are included in the financial statements attached hereto. We generate sales through (i) outbound telemarketing and field sales contacts by sales representatives focused on the business, educational, healthcare, and government markets, (ii) our websites, and (iii) direct responses from customers responding to our advertising media. We offer a broad selection of over 425,000 products at competitive prices, including products from vendors like Apple, Cisco Systems, Dell, EMC, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Microsoft, and VMWare, and we partner with more than 1,600 suppliers. We typically leverage our state-of-the art logistic capabilities to ship product to customers the same day the order is received.
     Since our founding in 1982, we have consistently served our customers’ needs by providing innovative, reliable, and timely service and technical support, and by offering an extensive assortment of branded products through knowledgeable, well-trained sales and support teams. Our strategy’s effectiveness is reflected in the recognition we have received, including being named to the Fortune 1000 and the CRN Solution Provider 500 for eighteen straight years. Over the past few years, we have received numerous awards, including the Microsoft Excellence in Operations—Double Gold Level Award for delivering market-leading operational excellence, as well as being recently named to the CRN Tech Elite 250 for the third year. We believe that our ability to understand our customers’ needs and provide comprehensive and effective IT solutions has resulted in strong brand name recognition and a broad and loyal customer base. We also believe that through our strong vendor relationships we can provide an efficient supply chain and be an effective IT solution provider for our multiple customer segments.
     We strive to identify the unique needs of our corporate, government, healthcare, educational, and small business customers, and have designed our business processes to enable our customers to effectively manage their IT systems. We provide value by offering our customers efficient design, integration, deployment, and support of their IT environments. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 823 sales representatives, whose average tenure exceeded six years. Sales representatives are responsible for managing enterprise, commercial, and public sector accounts, as specialization and a deep understanding of unique customer environments are more important than ever. These sales representatives focus on current and prospective customers and are supported by an increasing number of engineering, technical, and administrative staff. We believe that increasing our salesforce productivity is important to our future success, and we have increased our headcount and investments in this area accordingly.
     In September 2016, we launched “Connection®,” uniting all of our subsidiaries into one cohesive brand, reflecting the promise of our trademark blue arc and our mission to connect people with technology that enhances growth, elevates productivity, and empowers innovation. MoreDirect, our enterprise team, became Connection® Enterprise Solutions; PC Connection Sales Corp, our SMB-focused team, became Connection® Business Solutions; and GovConnection, our public sector team, became Connection® Public Sector Solutions.
     We market our products and services through our websites: www.connection.com, www.connection.com/enterprise, www.connection.com/publicsector, and www.macconnection.com. Our websites provide extensive product information, customized pricing, rich content, and a digital platform for online orders.

  Additional financial information regarding our business segments and geographic data about our customers and assets is contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of Part II, and in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
     We are subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and accordingly, we file reports, proxy and information statements, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Information regarding the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains a website (http://www.sec.gov) that contains such reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. We maintain a corporate website with the address www.connection.com. We are not including the information contained in our website as part of, or incorporating by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available free of charge through our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file these materials with, or otherwise furnish them to, the SEC.
     MARKET AND COMPETITION
     In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we generated approximately 38% of our sales from small- to medium-sized customer accounts, 43% from medium-to-large corporate accounts (Fortune 1000), and 19% from government and educational institutions. The overall IT market that we serve is estimated to be approximately $200 billion.
     The largest segment of this market is served by local and regional “value added resellers”, or VARs, many of whom we believe are transitioning from the hardware and software products business to higher-margin IT services. We have transitioned from an end-user or desktop-centric computing supplier to a network or enterprise-wide IT solutions supplier. We have also partnered with third-party technology and telecommunications service providers. We now offer our customers access to the same services and technical expertise as local and regional VARs, but with a more extensive product selection at generally lower prices.
     Intense competition for customers has led manufacturers of our IT products to use all available channels, including solutions providers, to distribute their products. Certain of these manufacturers who have traditionally used resellers to distribute their products have, from time to time, established their own direct marketing operations, including sales through the Internet. Nonetheless, we believe that these manufacturers will continue to provide us and other third-party solutions providers favorable product allocations and marketing support.
     We believe new entrants to the IT Solutions channel must overcome a number of obstacles, including:
    
· | the substantial time and resources required to build a customer base of meaningful size and profitability for cost-effective operation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the high costs of developing the information systems and operating infrastructure required to successfully compete as a national solutions provider;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the advantages enjoyed by larger and more established competitors in terms of purchasing and operating efficiencies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the difficulty of building relationships with vendors to achieve favorable product allocations and attractive pricing terms; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the difficulty of identifying and recruiting management personnel with significant direct marketing experience in the industry.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 BUSINESS STRATEGIES
     We believe we become our customers’ IT provider of choice by providing innovative IT solutions which meet their needs of increased productivity, mobility, virtualization, and security in a continually evolving IT environment. We provide enhanced value by assisting them in cost-effectively maximizing business opportunities provided by new technologies and advanced service solutions. The key elements of our business strategies include:
· | Providing consistent customer service before, during, and after the sale. We believe that we have earned a reputation for providing superior customer service by consistently focusing on our customers’ needs. We have dedicated our resources to developing strong, long-term relationships with our customers by accurately assessing their IT needs, and providing scalable, high-quality solutions and services through our knowledgeable, well-trained personnel. Through operational excellence, we have efficient delivery programs that provide a quality buying experience for our customers with reasonable return policies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Offering a broad product selection at competitive prices. We offer a broad range of IT products and solutions, including personal computers and related peripheral products, servers, storage, managed services, and networking infrastructure, at costs that allow our customers to be more productive while maximizing their IT budgets. Our advanced solution offerings include network, server, storage, and mission-critical onsite installation and support using proprietary cloud-based service management software. We offer products and enhanced service capabilities with aggressive price and performance standards, all with the convenience of one-stop shopping for technology solutions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Simplifying technology product procurement for corporate customers. We offer Internet-based procurement options to eliminate complexity and enhance customer value, as well as lower the cost of procurement for our customers. We specialize in Internet-based solutions and provide electronic integration between our customers and suppliers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Offering targeted IT solutions. Our customers seek solutions to increasingly complex IT infrastructure demands. To better address their business needs, we have focused our solution service capabilities on seven practice areas—Converged Data Center, Networking, Mobility, Security, Cloud Solutions, Lifecycle, and Software. These IT practice groups are responsible for understanding the infrastructure needs of our customers, and for designing cost-effective technology solutions to address them. We have also partnered with third-party providers to make available a range of IT support services, including asset assessment, implementation, maintenance, and disposal services. We believe we can leverage these seven practice groups to transform our company into a recognized IT solution provider, which will enable us to capture a greater share of the IT expenditures of our customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintaining a strong brand name and customer awareness. Since our founding in 1982, we have built a strong brand name and customer awareness. We have been named to the Fortune 1000 and the CRN Solution Provider 500 for each of the last eighteen years. We actively work with our existing customers to become their IT provider of choice for products and enhanced solution services, while seeking to ensure our reputation of high-quality customer service, tailored marketing programs, and competitive pricing lead the way to expanding our share of the overall IT market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintaining long-standing vendor relationships. We have a history of strong relationships with vendors, and were among the first national solutions providers qualified by manufacturers to market computer systems to end users. By working closely with our vendors to provide an efficient channel for the advertising and distribution of their products and solutions, we expect to expand market share and generate opportunities for optimizing partner incentive programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 GROWTH STRATEGIES
     Our growth strategies are designed to increase revenues by maximizing operational efficiencies while offering innovative products and value added service offerings, increasing penetration of our existing customers, and expanding our customer base. Our six key elements of growth are:
· | Expanding hardware and software offerings. We offer our customers an extensive range of IT hardware and software products, and in response to customer demand, we continually evaluate and add new products as they become available. We work closely with vendors to identify and source first-to-market product offerings at aggressive prices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expanding IT solution services offerings. We strive to accelerate solution and service growth by providing creative solutions to the increasingly complex hardware and software needs of our customers. Our Converged Data Center, Networking, Mobility, Security, Cloud Solutions, Lifecycle, and Software services practice groups consist of industry-certified and product-certified engineers, as well as highly specialized third-party providers. Our investment in these seven practice areas is expected to increase our share of our customers’ annual IT expenditures by broadening the range of products and services they purchase from us.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Targeting customer segments. Through increased targeted marketing, we seek to expand the number of our active customers and generate additional sales to existing customers by providing more value-added services and solutions. We have developed specialty catalogs featuring product offerings designed to address the needs of specific customer populations, including new product inserts targeted to purchasers of graphics, server, and networking products. We also utilize Internet marketing campaigns that focus on select markets, such as healthcare. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increasing productivity of our sales representatives. We believe that higher sales productivity is the key to leveraging our expense structure and driving future profitability improvements. We invest significant resources in training new sales representatives and providing ongoing training to experienced personnel. Our training and evaluation programs are focused towards assisting our sales personnel in understanding and anticipating clients’ IT needs, with the goal of fostering loyal customer relationships. We also provide our sales representatives with technical support on more complex sales opportunities through our expanding group of technical solution specialists.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Migrating to cloud-based solutions for our customers. Cloud computing is a key driver of new IT spending as our customers seek scalable, cost-effective solutions. We plan to expand our cloud-based solution sales and assist our customers in navigating the complex and growing field of cloud-solution offerings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances. We seek acquisitions and alliances that add new customers, strengthen our product and solution offerings, add management talent, and produce operating results which are accretive to our core business earnings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      SERVICE AND SUPPORT
     Since our founding in 1982, our primary objective has been to provide products and services that meet the demands and needs of customers and to supplement those products with up-to-date product information and excellent customer service and support. We believe that offering our customers superior value, through a combination of product knowledge, consistent and reliable service and support, and leading products at competitive prices, differentiates us from other national solutions providers and provides the foundation for developing a broad and loyal customer base.
     We invest in training programs for our service and support personnel, with an emphasis on putting customer needs and service first. Product support technicians assist customers with questions concerning compatibility, installation, and more difficult questions relating to product use. The product support technicians authorize customers to return defective or incompatible products to either the manufacturer or to us for warranty service. In-house technicians perform both warranty and non-warranty repair on most major systems and hardware products.

     Using our customized information system, we transmit our customer orders either to our distribution center or to our drop‑ship suppliers, depending on product availability, for processing immediately after a customer receives credit approval. At our distribution center, we also perform custom configuration services, which typically includes custom imaging, the installation and integration of additional components, and other technology enhancements. Our customers may select the method of delivery that best meets their needs and is most cost effective, ranging from expedited overnight delivery for urgently needed items to ground freight. 
      Our inventory stocking strategy is based on economics and the general availability of the product. We will stock product where there is an economic advantage to do so, or the product is in constrained supply. We also will stock product to support customer rollouts, including product that is running through our configuration and integration services prior to shipment.
     MARKETING AND SALES
     We sell our products through our direct marketing channels to (i) SMBs including small office/home office customers, (ii) government and educational institutions, and (iii) medium-to-large corporate accounts. We strive to be the primary supplier of IT products and solutions to our existing and prospective customers by providing exemplary customer service. We use multiple marketing approaches to reach existing and prospective customers, including:
· | outbound telemarketing and field sales;
--+----------------------------------------


· | digital, web, and print media advertising; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | targeted marketing programs to specific customer populations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

      All of our marketing approaches emphasize our broad product and service offerings, fast delivery, customer support, competitive pricing, and our wide range of service solutions.
     Sales Channels. We believe that our ability to establish and maintain long-term customer relationships and to encourage repeat purchases is largely dependent on the strength of our sales personnel and programs. Because our customers’ primary contact with us is through our sales representatives, we are committed to maintaining a qualified, knowledgeable, and motivated sales staff with its principal focus on customer service.
     Outbound Telemarketing and Field Sales. We seek to build loyal relationships with potential high-volume customers by assigning them to individual account managers. We believe that customers respond favorably to one-on-one relationships with personalized, well-trained account managers. Once established, these one-on-one relationships are maintained and enhanced through frequent telecommunications and targeted electronic communications, as well as other marketing materials designed to meet each customer’s specific IT needs. We pay most of our account managers a base annual salary plus incentive compensation. Incentive compensation is tied generally to gross profit dollars produced by the individual account manager. Account managers historically have significantly increased productivity after approximately twelve months of training and experience. 
     E-commerce Sales. (www.connection.com, www.connection.com/enterprise, www.connection.com/publicsector, and www.macconnection.com)  We provide product descriptions and prices for generally all products online. Our Connection website also provides updated information for more than 425,000 items. We offer, and continuously update, selected product offerings and other special buys. We believe our websites are important sales sources and communication tools for improving customer service.
     Our MoreDirect subsidiary’s business process and operations are primarily Web-based. Most of its corporate customers utilize a customized Web page to quickly search, source, and track IT products. MoreDirect’s website (www.connection.com/enterprise) aggregates the current available inventories of its largest IT suppliers into a single online source for its corporate customers. Its custom designed Internet-based system, TRAXX®, provides corporate buyers with comparative pricing from several suppliers as well as special pricing arranged through the manufacturer.

     The Internet supports three key business initiatives for us:
    
· | Customer choice — We have built our business on the premise that our customers should be able to choose how they interact with us--be it by telephone, or by means of their desktop or mobile device via email or the Internet.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Lowering transactions costs — Our website tools include robust product search features and Internet Business Accounts (customized Web pages), which allow customers to quickly and easily find information about products of interest to them. If customers still have questions, they may call our account managers. Such phone calls are typically shorter and have higher close rates than calls from customers who have not first visited our websites.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leveraging the time of experienced sales representatives — Our investments in technology-based sales and service programs allow our sales representatives more time to build and maintain relationships with our customers and help them to solve their business problems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Business Segments. We conduct our business operations through three business segments: Business Solutions, Enterprise Solutions, and Public Sector Solutions.
     Business Solutions Segment. Our principal target markets in this segment are small-to-medium-sized business customers. We use a combination of outbound telemarketing, including some on-site sales solicitation by business development managers, and Internet sales through customized Internet Business Accounts, to reach these customers.     
     Enterprise Solutions Segment. Through our custom designed Web-based system, we are able to offer our larger corporate customers an efficient and effective method of sourcing, evaluating, purchasing, and tracking a wide variety of IT products and services. Our strategy is to be the primary single source procurement portal for our large corporate customers.
     Public Sector Solutions Segment. We use a combination of outbound telemarketing, including some on-site sales solicitation by business development managers, and Internet sales through customized Internet Business Accounts, to reach these customers. We target each of the four distinct market sectors within this segment—federal government, higher educational institutions, school grades K-12, and state and local governments.
     The following table sets forth the relative distribution of net sales by business segment:
    
 | Years Ended December 31, | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Sales Segment | | | | | | 
Enterprise Solutions | 43 | % | 39 | % | 38 | %
Business Solutions | 38 | | 40 | | 40 | 
Public Sector Solutions | 19 | | 21 | | 22 | 
Total | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %

      Our brand, and each of Connection’s business segments, is supported by targeted marketing campaigns across a variety of media:
     Digital. We utilize a series of digital programs, in conjunction with advanced data analytics, to identify prospective customers and generate new leads within our existing customer base. These programs include website, email, blog, social media, electronic catalogs, webinars, and video/multimedia promotions.
     Print. Connection produces a variety of print media, including direct mail pieces and Connected, a quarterly publication that provides informative articles on the latest technologies and industry trends. We distribute specialty catalogs to education, healthcare, and government customers and prospective customers on a periodic basis. The 

 
  6

 
Company’s MacConnection® brand publishes an eponymous catalog for the Apple market. These publications showcase the depth of our in-house expertise in the marketplace and extend Connection’s brand to a wide audience of IT decision makers.
     Specialty Marketing. In addition to our digital and print marketing efforts, Connection maintains a strong presence at industry tradeshows and conventions across the country, including a number of healthcare and education IT conferences. Connection also hosts a series of Technology Summits each year, with a focus on building stronger relationships with our customers and reinforcing our reputation as a trusted source of expertise. 
     Customers. We maintain an extensive database of customers and prospects. However, no single customer accounted for more than 3% of our consolidated revenue in 2018. While no single agency of the federal government comprised more than 3% of total sales, aggregate sales to the federal government were 5.4% 7.8%, and 7.5% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on any of our business segments. In addition, we do not have individual orders in our backlog that are material to our business, as we typically ship products within hours of receipt of orders.
     PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISING
     We continuously focus on expanding the breadth of our product and service offerings. We currently offer our customers over 425,000 information technology products designed for business applications from more than 1,600 vendors, including hardware and peripherals, accessories, networking products, and software. We select the products we sell based upon their technology and effectiveness, market demand, product features, quality, price, margins, and warranties. The following table sets forth our percentage of net sales (in dollars) for major product categories:
 | PERCENTAGE OF | 
 | NET SALES | 
 | Years Ended December 31, | 
 | 2018 (1) | | 2017 (2) | | 2016 (2) | 
Notebooks/Mobility | 26 | % | 22 | % | 23 | %
Accessories | 13 | | 10 | | 11 | 
Software | 12 | | 23 | | 20 | 
Desktops | 11 | | 11 | | 10 | 
Servers/Storage | 11 | | 9 | | 10 | 
Displays and sound | 9 | | 8 | | 8 | 
Net/Com Product | 8 | | 7 | | 8 | 
Other Hardware/Services | 10 | | 10 | | 10 | 
Total | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %


(1) | The Company adopted ASC 606 in 2018 using the modified retrospective approach, which primarily resulted in certain software sales being reported on a net basis where they would have otherwise been reported on a gross basis under the previous revenue recognition guidance. As a result, certain revenue figures reported in the current year may not be comparable with prior-year disclosures.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Product categories were separated into additional categories in 2018. Certain prior-year balances have been reclassified to conform to 2018 presentation.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We offer a 30-day right of return generally limited to defective merchandise. Returns of non-defective products are subject to restocking fees. Substantially all of the products marketed by us are warranted by the manufacturer. We generally accept returns directly from the customer and then either credit the customer’s account or ship the customer a replacement or similar product from our inventory.
     PURCHASING AND VENDOR RELATIONS
     Product purchases from Ingram Micro, Inc., or Ingram, our largest supplier, accounted for approximately 22% of our total product purchases in both 2018 and 2017 and 21% in 2016. Purchases from Synnex Corporation, or Synnex, comprised 12%, 12%, and 13% of our total product purchases in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Purchases from Tech Data comprised of 10%, 11% and 8% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Purchases from Hewlett-Packard 

 
  7

 
Company, or HP, accounted for approximately 7% of our total product purchases in 2018, 11% in 2017, and 9% in 2016. No other vendor supplied more than 10% of our total product purchases in 2018, 2017, or 2016. We believe that, while we may experience some short-term disruption if products from Ingram, Synnex, HP and/or Tech Data become unavailable to us, alternative sources for products obtained directly from Ingram, Synnex, HP and Tech Data are available. 
     Products manufactured by HP represented approximately 18% of our net sales in 2018 and approximately 20% in both 2017 and 2016. We believe that in the event we experience either a short-term or permanent disruption of supply of HP products, such disruption would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
     Many product suppliers reimburse us for advertisements or other cooperative marketing programs in our catalogs and other marketing vehicles. Reimbursements may be in the form of discounts, advertising allowances, and/or rebates. We also receive allowances from certain vendors based upon the volume of our purchases or sales of the vendors’ products by us. Some of our vendors offer limited price protection in the form of rebates or credits against future purchases. We may also participate in end-of-life product and other special purchases which may not be eligible for price protection.
     We believe that we have excellent relationships with our vendors. We generally pay vendors within stated terms, or earlier when favorable cash discounts are offered. We believe our high volume of purchases enables us to obtain product pricing and terms that are competitive with those available to other national IT solutions providers. Although brand names and individual product offerings are important to our business, we believe that competitive products are available in substantially all of the merchandise categories offered by us.
     DISTRIBUTION
     We fulfill orders from customers both from products we hold in inventory and through drop shipping arrangements with manufacturers and distributors. At our 283,000 square foot technology integration and distribution complex in Wilmington, Ohio, we receive and ship inventory, configure and integrate technology solutions, provide depot maintenance and services, and process returned products.
     We also place product orders directly with manufacturers and/or distribution companies for drop shipment directly to our customers. Order status with distributors is tracked online, and in all circumstances, a confirmation of shipment from manufacturers and/or distribution companies is received prior to initial recording of the transaction. At the end of each financial reporting period, revenue is adjusted to reflect the anticipated receipt of products by the customers in the period. Products drop shipped by suppliers were 80%, 77%, and 75%, of net sales in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In future years, we expect that products drop shipped from suppliers may increase, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, as we seek to lower our overall inventory and distribution costs while maintaining excellent customer service.
     Certain of our larger customers occasionally request special staged delivery arrangements under which either we or our distribution partners set aside and temporarily hold inventory on our customer’s behalf. Such orders are firm delivery orders, and customers generally pay under normal credit terms, regardless of delivery. Revenue on such transactions is not recorded until shipment to their final destination as requested by the customer. Inventory held for such staged delivery requests aggregated $46.1 million and $32.0 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
         MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
     Our subsidiaries utilize management information systems which have been significantly customized for our use. These systems permit centralized management of key functions, including order taking and processing, inventory and accounts receivable management, purchasing, sales, and distribution, and the preparation of daily operating control reports on key aspects of the business. We also operate advanced telecommunications equipment to support our sales and customer service operations. Key elements of the telecommunications systems are integrated with our computer systems to provide timely customer information to sales and service representatives, and to facilitate the preparation of operating and performance data.

     Our success is dependent in large part on the accuracy and proper use of our information systems, including our telephone systems, to manage our inventory and accounts receivable collections, to purchase, sell, and ship our products efficiently and on a timely basis, and to maintain cost-efficient operations. We expect to continue upgrading our information systems in the future to more effectively manage our operations and customer database.
     Our investments in IT systems and infrastructure are designed to enable us to operate more efficiently and to provide our customers enhanced functionality. In October 2017, we began a multi-year initiative to upgrade our IT infrastructure, and have incurred $16.3 million of capital expenditures through December 31, 2018. We expect additional related capital expenditures to range from $6.0 to $7.0 million over the next six to nine months, when we expect to have completed the initiative. For further discussion see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” of Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
     COMPETITION
     The direct marketing and sale of IT-related products is highly competitive. We compete with other national solutions providers of IT products, including CDW Corporation and Insight Enterprises, Inc., who are the current leaders in the space. We also compete with:
· | certain product manufacturers that sell directly to customers as well as some of our own suppliers, such as Apple, Dell, HP, and Lenovo;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | software publishers, such as Microsoft, VMware, Adobe, and Symantec;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | distributors that sell directly to certain customers;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | local and regional VARs;
--+-------------------------


· | various franchisers, office supply superstores, and national computer retailers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | e-tailers, such as Amazon Web Services, with more extensive commercial online networks.

      Additional competition may arise if other new methods of distribution emerge in the future. We compete not only for customers, but also for favorable product allocations and cooperative advertising support from product manufacturers. Several of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources. These and other factors related to our competitive position are discussed more fully in the “Overview” of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
     We believe that price, product selection and availability, solutions capabilities, and service and support are the most important competitive factors in our industry.
