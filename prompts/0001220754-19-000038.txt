Overview

The Providence Service Corporation (“we”, the “Company” or “Providence”) owns subsidiaries and investments primarily engaged in the provision of healthcare services in the United States. The Company’s NET Services segment, which primarily operates under the brands LogistiCare and Circulation, is the largest manager of non-emergency medical transportation (“NET”) programs for state governments and managed care organizations (“MCOs”) in the United States. On September 21, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Circulation, Inc. (“Circulation”), which offers a full suite of logistics solutions to manage NET programs across all areas of healthcare, powered by its HIPAA-compliant digital platform. Circulation’s technology expands LogistiCare’s capabilities to manage transportation benefits, integrating all transportation capabilities and emphasizing member convenience and satisfaction. 
The Company’s Matrix Investment segment consists of a minority investment in CCHN Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Matrix”), a nationwide provider of home and mobile-based healthcare services for health plans in the United States, including comprehensive health assessments (“CHAs”), quality gap closure visits, “level of service” needs assessments, and post-acute and chronic care management, providing such services through a network of community-based clinicians, and a fleet of mobile health clinics with advanced diagnostics capabilities. On October 19, 2016, affiliates of Frazier Healthcare Partners purchased a controlling equity interest in Matrix, with the Company retaining a non-controlling equity interest (the “Matrix Transaction”). Matrix’s financial results prior to October 19, 2016 are presented as a discontinued operation.

The Company’s Corporate and Other segment includes the Company’s executive, accounting, finance, internal audit, tax, legal, public reporting, and corporate development functions, as well as the results of the Company’s captive insurance company. On April 11, 2018, the Company announced an organizational consolidation plan to integrate substantially all activities and functions performed at the corporate holding company level into LogistiCare (the “Organizational Consolidation”). LogistiCare will retain its name and continue to be headquartered in Atlanta, GA, and the Company will continue to be named The Providence Service Corporation and be listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the ticker symbol “PRSC”. The Organizational Consolidation process involves transferring all job responsibilities previously performed by employees of the 
3

holding company to LogistiCare and closing the current corporate offices in Stamford, Connecticut and Tucson, Arizona. The Organizational Consolidation is expected to be complete by the end of the second quarter of 2019.
On December 21, 2018, we completed the sale of substantially all of the operating subsidiaries of our Workforce Development Services (“WD Services”) segment to Advanced Personnel Management Global Pty Ltd of Australia (“APM”) and APM UK Holdings Limited, an affiliate of APM, except for the segment’s employment services operations in Saudi Arabia (the “WD Services Sale”). Our contractual counterparties in Saudi Arabia, including an entity owned by the Saudi Arabian government, assumed these operations beginning January 1, 2019.
On June 11, 2018, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement to sell Ingeus France, which was part of our WD Services segment, for a de minimis amount. The sale was effective on July 17, 2018, after court approval. The financial results of WD Services prior to December 21, 2018 are presented as discontinued operations.

The Company is a Delaware corporation formed in 1996 and headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. 

Business Strategies 
The Company’s mission is to provide effective and quality NET services and logistics and to create shareholder value by pursuing and implementing six key strategies.
Centers of Excellence Operations Alignment 
In January 2019, we reorganized the operational structure of our NET Services segment in order to centralize and reduce the layers in core functions that form the most significant elements of our cost base and drive performance for our clients and the members and patients they serve. Our operational structure now includes six Centers of Excellence (“COEs”): Transportation Network, Call Center Operations, Client Services, Technology, Growth and Process Improvement. We implemented this operational strategy to enhance the visibility, flexibility and control we have over our operations. The Transportation Network COE is focused on increases to capacity and improvements to quality and improvements designed to reduce cost and enhance the member experience. Within our Call Center Operations, activities such as contact center workflow standardization, cross skilling, and intensive operations management are aimed at improving employee productivity. We believe the new model for Client Services will bring a closer focus on local operations as well as holistic approaches to our customers and client retention. Our Technology COE will be coordinated and focused on the support of operations and the systematic roll out of the Circulation technology platform. Growth will continue to focus our sales, marketing and business development teams on the generation and delivery of new business. Finally, our Process Improvement COE will continue to support all of our other COE’s in the pursuit of effective and efficient operations. We believe this new structure makes our scale more nimble and provides us with a competitive advantage. 
Technology Transformation 
On September 21, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Circulation to revolutionize our technology development capability, add to our executive team, extend our business model, and open new market opportunities. We believe that this technology allows us to reduce transportation as a barrier to care and that through the deployment of our new technology we are able to extend the size of the market that we can serve. In order to achieve our target synergies and enhance our operations, we plan to roll out Circulation’s technology as our core workflow platform over the next 36 months. We have 21 operations centers that we expect to convert to the Circulation platform. Our plan is to convert several call centers in 2019, beginning in the second quarter, with a target to convert all sites by the end of 2021. Technology roll outs include a substantial amount of change management and will require careful risk mitigation policies to ensure smooth transitions. Our change management process is a core strength deeply embedded in our organization and will support a major change in the way we operate today, driving significant efficiencies and enhancing the member experience benefits to our clients.
Client and Member Satisfaction
Transportation related to care is one of the most impactful experiences contributing to our clients’ members’ and patients’ satisfaction during their care encounter. At the core of our operational and technology strategies is a focus on driving client and member satisfaction. Our COEs’ operational structure allows us to develop locally tailored network solutions with a higher level of visibility. Greater access to real time information, enabled through our technology, provides us the ability to shorten cycle times to identify and resolve client and member issues. We expect our clients to begin to realize benefits in the near term from our new organizational model and roll out of the Circulation technology platform.

Organic Growth 
Across the healthcare market, we see an increasing understanding of the benefit of removing transportation as a barrier to care and a way to improve other determinants of health, such as access to food, shelter, socialization, and pharmacy. We believe that our scale, deep experience, operational strategy, and technology migration uniquely position us to address customer needs related to transportation of vulnerable populations. We approach sales, marketing and business development in a manner that is focused on driving market share in our core Medicaid market including states and MCOs, Medicare Advantage (“MA”) plans, health systems and providers. Simultaneously, we target business development efforts with partners to enter new transportation markets, including the movement of home health providers, pharmacy delivery and beneficiaries of workers compensation. We expect there will be network effects as we serve more and more healthcare constituencies within a geography. 
Inorganic Growth 
We closely follow our core NET market and expansion markets mentioned above for tuck-in acquisition opportunities. We believe our experience, relationships in the industry, scale and executive team gives us the strongest position to be a consolidation platform in healthcare transportation. Our acquisition strategy may include an evaluation of new entrants, which may not be able to otherwise compete without the benefits of scale and experience, and closely-held businesses that may seek a new capital structure or sale to achieve liquidity for founders. With our balance sheet, strong team and track record, we believe we are a natural consolidator.
Smart Capital Allocation
The WD Services sale was a significant milestone in our strategy to focus our capital allocation priorities on the opportunities available to our NET Services segment. The NET Services segment has historically generated positive cash flows and our strong balance sheet provides us with optionality with respect to capital allocation and how we can best drive shareholder value. Our immediate focus in 2019 is to invest in our operations, including the roll-out of the Circulation technology to enhance client and member experience and drive operational efficiency. We will also continue to assess the opportunities for capital deployment in order to create value for shareholders, which may include dividends, share repurchases and/or acquisitions.

NET Services

Services offered. NET Services provides non-emergency transportation solutions to clients, including health systems, in 40 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 24.5 million individuals were eligible to receive our transportation services, and during 2018, NET Services managed approximately 52.6 million trips. NET Services accounts for all of our consolidated revenue from continuing operations going forward.

NET Services primarily contracts with state Medicaid programs and MCOs, including MA plans, (collectively “NET customers”) for the coordination of their members’ (“NET end-users”) non-emergency transportation needs. NET end-users are typically Medicaid or Medicare eligible members, whose limited mobility or financial resources hinders their ability to access necessary healthcare and social services. We believe our transportation services enable access to care that not only improves the quality of life and health of the populations we serve, but also enables many of the individuals we serve to pursue independent living in their homes rather than in more expensive institutional care settings. In addition, studies have shown that missed medical appointments lessens patient compliance with clinical guidelines and leads to complications and expensive medical services. Through provider access to medical transportation, NET Services can save state Medicaid programs and MCOs significant amounts of money when used as part of a care management strategy for individuals with chronic illness. We believe we are uniquely positioned to partner with NET customers to provide these savings while improving the lives of the populations we serve.

NET Services program delivery is dependent upon a highly-integrated technology platform and business process as well as the management of a multifaceted network of subcontracted transportation providers. Our technology platform is purpose-built for the unique needs of our industry and is highly scalable, capable of supporting substantial growth in our clients’ current and future membership base. In addition, our technology platform efficiently provides a broad interconnectivity among NET end-users, NET customers, and our network of transportation providers. We believe this technological capability and our industry experience uniquely position us as a future focal point in the evolving healthcare industry to introduce valuable population insights. In 2016 and 2017, we introduced service offerings and new technological features for NET end-users to improve service levels, lower costs and build the foundation for additional data analytics capabilities. In 2018, we acquired Circulation to provide additional technological improvements through their digital transportation platform. Circulation’s technology allows for on-demand ride scheduling, eligibility assessment, benefits management, ride assignment and dispatch, real time ride tracking, network management and analytics.

5

To fulfill the transportation needs of NET end-users, we apply our proprietary technology platform to an extensive network of approximately 4,500 transportation resources. This includes our in-network roster of fully contracted transportation providers who operate sedans, wheelchair equipped vehicles, multi-passenger vans and ambulances. Our system also utilizes partnerships with on-demand transportation network companies, mass transit entities, mileage reimbursement programs, taxis and county-based emergency medical service providers. To promote safety, quality, and compliance, our in-network transportation providers undergo an in-depth credentialing and education process. 
Our transportation management services also include fraud, waste, and abuse prevention and utilization review programs designed to monitor that our transportation services are provided in compliance with Medicaid and Medicare program rules and remediate issues that are identified. Compliance controls include ongoing monitoring, auditing and remediation efforts, such as validating NET end-user eligibility for the requested date of service and employing a series of gatekeeping questions to verify that the treatment type is covered and the appropriate mode of transportation is assigned. We also conduct post-trip confirmations of attendance directly with the healthcare providers for certain repetitive trips and we employ field monitors to inspect transportation provider vehicles and observe some transports in real time. Our claims validation process generally limits payment to trips that are properly documented, have been authorized in advance, and are billed at the pre-trip estimated amount. Our claims process is increasingly digital, which provides more protection to member protected health information and reduces the impact on the environment. Transportation providers are able to submit their bills and supporting documentation through a secured web portal directly to LogistiCare. 
Revenue and customers. In 2018, contracts with state Medicaid agencies and MCOs represented 52.9% and 47.1%, respectively, of NET Services’ revenue. NET Services derived 12.6%, 13.8% and 13.1% of its revenue from a single state Medicaid agency for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The next four largest NET Services customers in the aggregate comprised 21.4%, 22.3% and 22.6% of NET Services’ revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Contracts with state Medicaid agencies are typically for three to five years with multiple renewal options. Contracts with MCOs continue until terminated by either party upon reasonable notice (as determined in accordance with the contract), and allow for regular price adjustments based upon utilization and transportation cost. As of December 31, 2018, 13.2% of NET Services revenue was generated under state Medicaid contracts that are subject to renewal within the next 12 months. In 2018, NET Services renewed contracts representing 32.4% of its revenue in such year.

79.2% of NET Services’ revenue in 2018 was generated under capitated contracts where we assume the responsibility of meeting the covered healthcare related transportation requirements of a specific population based on per-member per-month fees for the number of members in the customer’s program. Revenue is recognized based on the population served during the period. Under certain capitated contracts, known as reconciliation contracts, partial payment is received as a prepayment during the month service is provided. These partial payments may be due back to the customer, or additional payments may be due to the Company, after each reconciliation period, based on a reconciliation of actual utilization and cost compared to the prepayment made. 20.8% of NET Services’ revenue was generated under other types of fee arrangements, including administrative services only, fee for service and cost plus (collectively “FFS”) and flat fee contracts, under which fees are generated based upon billing rates for specific services or defined membership populations. 

Seasonality. While revenue is generally fixed, primarily as a result of the capitated nature of the majority of our contracts, service expense varies based on the utilization of our services. The quarterly operating income and cash flows of NET Services normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business, principally due to lower transportation demand during the winter season and higher demand during the summer season.

Competition. We compete with a variety of national organizations that provide similar healthcare and social services related transportation, such as Medical Transportation Management, Southeastrans, Veyo, and Access2Care, as well as local and regional providers. Most local competitors seek to win contracts for specific counties or small geographic territories whereas we and other larger competitors seek to win contracts for an entire state or large regional area. We compete based upon a number of factors, including our nationwide network, technical expertise, experience, service capability, service quality, and price.
Matrix Investment

Our Matrix Investment is comprised of our interest in Matrix. Since the completion of the Matrix Transaction, the Company has had a non-controlling equity interest in Matrix. The Company and an affiliate of Frazier Healthcare Partners (the “Frazier Subscriber”), which holds the controlling equity interest in Matrix, are party to the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “Operating Agreement”) of Mercury Parent, LLC, the company through which the parties hold their equity interests in Matrix. The Operating Agreement sets forth certain terms and conditions regarding the ownership by the Company 
6

and Frazier Subscriber of interests in Mercury Parent and their indirect ownership of common stock of Matrix, and provides for, among other things, certain liquidity and governance rights and other obligations and rights, in each case, on the terms and conditions contained therein. 
At December 31, 2018, the Company owned a 43.6% non-controlling interest in Matrix. Prior to the closing of the Matrix Transaction, the financial results of Matrix were included in our Health Assessment Services (“HA Services”) segment. The Company’s proportionate share of Matrix’s net assets and financial results for the period following the closing of the Matrix Transaction are presented using the equity method. The assets, liabilities and financial results of Matrix for the period prior to the closing of the Matrix Transaction are presented within discontinued operations. For additional information regarding the Matrix Transaction, see Note 23, Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements.

Services offered. Matrix offers in-home care optimization services for members, including CHAs, through a national network of community-based clinicians and a fleet of mobile health clinics with advanced diagnostics capabilities. As of December 31, 2018, Matrix utilized a national network of approximately 3,500 clinical providers, including 1,800 nurse practitioners (“NPs”), located across 48 states, to provide its services primarily to members of Medicare Advantage (“MA”) health plans. 
Matrix expanded its provider network and service offerings through two acquisitions in 2017 and 2018. In December 2017, Matrix grew its clinical provider network through its acquisition of LP Health Services, a provider of quality and wellness visits on behalf of Medicaid/Duals managed care plans across the U.S., for a purchase price of $3.6 million. In February 2018, Matrix completed its acquisition of HealthFair, a leading operator of mobile clinics which offer preventative health assessment and advanced diagnostic testing services, including laboratory, ultrasound, EKG and mammography testing, for a purchase price of $155 million. Although to date the results of HealthFair have been below our expectations, we still believe the combination of the two organizations provides health plan members with more convenient access to important care management and preventative health services. 
Matrix primarily generates revenue from CHAs, which obtain a health plan member's information related to health status, social, environmental and medical risks and help the MA plans improve the accuracy of such information. Matrix also operates a care management offering which provides additional data analytics and chronic care management services.

Matrix’s services are dependent upon its technology platform which integrates the clinical provider network, operations infrastructure, call centers and clients. Matrix’s platform is designed for the unique needs of its industry, is highly scalable and can support substantial growth. We believe Matrix’s network and platform position Matrix as a future focal point in the evolving healthcare industry in the introduction of both additional population insights and care management services. With data provided by its health plan clients, Matrix utilizes analytics to determine which members it can most effectively lower costs and improve outcomes through face-to-face engagements with clinicians. Each program is customized and is served by a comprehensive team of case managers, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and trained call center colleagues.

Revenue, customers and clients. As of December 31, 2018, Matrix’s customers included 65 health plans, including for-profit multi-state health plans and non-profit health plans that operate in only one state or several counties within one state. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Matrix’s top five customers accounted for 66.3% of its revenue, as its largest customer accounted for 31.5% of its revenue and its second largest customer accounted for 21.2% of its revenue. Matrix enters into annual or multi-annual contracts with its customers under which it is paid on a per assessment basis. However, volumes are not guaranteed under contracts and customers may choose to utilize other third party providers or in-source capabilities.  A significant customer has indicated it intends to in-source certain services, which may result in a decrease in volume for Matrix.  

Seasonality. Matrix attempts to perform CHAs evenly throughout the year to efficiently utilize NP capacity, although the timing of performance is driven by client demand. 

Competition. We believe that Matrix and Signify Health are the largest independent providers of CHAs to the health plan market. There are many smaller competitors, such as EMSI Healthcare Services, MedXM, which was acquired by Quest Diagnostics on February 1, 2018, and Inovalon. In addition, some health plans in-source CHA services. Matrix’s chronic care management competitors include Landmark Healthcare, PopHealthCare and Optum.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,000 employees. None of our employees are members of a union. We believe we have good relationships with our employees.

Regulatory Environment

Overview

Our NET Services and Matrix Investment segments (the “Healthcare Segments”) are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and agency guidance (collectively, “Laws”). These Laws significantly affect the way in which these segments operate various aspects of their businesses. Our Healthcare Segments must also comply with state and local licensing requirements, state and federal requirements for participation in Medicare and Medicaid, requirements for contracting with MA plans, and contractual requirements imposed upon them by the federal, state and local agencies and third-party commercial customers to which they provide services. Failure to follow the rules and requirements of these programs can significantly affect our Healthcare Segments’ ability to be paid for the services they provide and be authorized to provide services on an ongoing basis.

The Medicare and Medicaid programs are governed by significant and complex Laws.  Both Medicare and Medicaid are financed, at least in part, with federal funds. Therefore, any direct or indirect recipients of those funds are subject to federal fraud, waste and abuse Laws.  In addition, there are federal privacy and security Laws that govern the healthcare industry. State Laws primarily pertain to the licensure of certain categories of healthcare professionals and providers and the state’s interest in regulating the quality of healthcare in the state, regardless of the source of payment, but may also include state Laws pertaining to fraud, waste and abuse, privacy and security Laws, and the state’s regulation of its Medicaid program. Federal and state regulatory laws that may affect our Healthcare Segments’ businesses, include, but are not limited to the following:

• | false and other improper claims or false statements Laws pertaining to reimbursement;


• | the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and its privacy, security, breach notification and enforcement and code set regulations and guidance, along with evolving state Laws protecting patient privacy and requiring notifications of unauthorized access to, or use of, patient medical information;


• | civil monetary penalties Law;


• | anti-kickback Laws;


• | the Stark Law and other self-referral, financial inducement, fee splitting, and patient brokering Laws;


• | The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) regulations pertaining to Medicare as well as CMS releases applicable to the operation of MA plans, such as reimbursement rates, risk adjustment and data collection methodologies, adjustments to quality management measurements and other relevant factors; and


• | state licensure laws.


A violation of certain of these Laws could result in civil and criminal damages and penalties, the refund of monies paid by government or private payors, our Healthcare Segments’ exclusion from participation in federal healthcare payor programs, or the loss of our segments’ license to conduct business within a particular state’s boundaries. 

Federal Law

Federal healthcare Laws apply in any case in which our Healthcare Segments are providing an item or service that is reimbursable or provide information to such segments’ customers that results in reimbursement by a federal healthcare payor program to such segments or to them. The principal federal Laws that affect our Healthcare Segments’ businesses include those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims or other data with federal healthcare payor programs and those that prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federal healthcare payor programs.
False and Other Improper Claims

Under the federal False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733) and similar state Laws, the government may impose civil liability on our Healthcare Segments if they knowingly submit a false claim to the government or cause another to submit a false claim to the government, or knowingly make a false record or statement intended to get a false claim paid by the government. The False Claims Act defines a claim as a demand for money or property made directly to the government or to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient if the money is to be spent on the government’s behalf or if the government will reimburse the contractor or grantee. Liability can be incurred for submitting (or causing another to submit) false claims with actual knowledge or for submitting false claims with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance. Liability can also be incurred for knowingly making or using a false record or statement to receive payment from the federal government or for knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government. Consequently, a provider need not take an affirmative action to conceal or avoid an obligation to the government, but the mere retention of an overpayment from the government could lead to potential liability under the False Claims Act.

8

Many states also have similar false claims statutes. In addition, healthcare fraud is a priority of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”), its program integrity contractors and its Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and state Attorneys General. These agencies have devoted a significant amount of resources to investigating healthcare fraud.

If our Healthcare Segments are ever found to have violated the False Claims Act, they could be required to make significant payments to the government (including damages and penalties in addition to the return of reimbursements previously collected) and could be excluded from participating in federal healthcare programs or providing services to entities which contract with those programs. Although our Healthcare Segments monitor their billing practices for compliance with applicable laws, such laws are very complex, and they might not be able to detect all errors or interpret such laws in a manner consistent with a court or an agency’s interpretation. While the criminal statutes generally are reserved for instances evidencing fraudulent intent, the civil and administrative penalty statutes are being applied by the federal government in an increasingly broad range of circumstances. Examples of the types of activities giving rise to liability for filing false claims include billing for services not rendered, misrepresenting services rendered (i.e., miscoding), applications for duplicate reimbursement and providing false information that results in reimbursement or impacts reimbursement amounts. Additionally, the federal government takes the position that a pattern of claiming reimbursement for unnecessary services violates these statutes if the claimant should have known that the services were unnecessary. The federal government also takes the position that claiming reimbursement for services that are substandard is a violation of these statutes if the claimant should have known that the care was substandard. Criminal penalties also are available even in the case of claims filed with private insurers if the federal government shows that the claims constitute mail fraud or wire fraud or violate any of the federal criminal healthcare fraud statutes.

State Medicaid agencies and state Attorneys General also have authority to seek criminal or civil sanctions for fraud and abuse violations. In addition, private insurers may bring actions under state false claim laws. In certain circumstances, federal and state laws authorize private whistleblowers to bring false claim or “qui tam” suits on behalf of the government against providers and reward the whistleblower with a portion of any final recovery. In addition, the federal government has engaged a number of private audit organizations to assist it in tracking and recovering claims for healthcare services that may have been improperly submitted.

Governmental investigations and whistleblower “qui tam” suits against healthcare companies have increased significantly in recent years, and have resulted in substantial penalties and fines and exclusions of persons and entities from participating in government healthcare programs. For more information on the risks related to a failure to comply with applicable government coding and billing rules, see “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks—Our Healthcare Segments could be subject to actions for false claims or recoupment of funds pursuant to certain audits if they do not comply with government coding and billing rules, which could have a material adverse impact on our segments’ operating results.”

Health Information Practices

Under HIPAA, DHHS issued rules to define and implement standards for the electronic transactions and code sets for the submission of transactions such as claims, and privacy and security of individually identifiable health information in whatever manner it is maintained.

The Final Rule on Enforcement of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification provisions, including the transaction standards, the security standards and the privacy rule, published by DHHS addresses, among other issues, DHHS’s policies for determining violations and calculating civil monetary penalties, how DHHS will address the statutory limitations on the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and various procedural issues. The rule extends enforcement provisions currently applicable to the healthcare privacy regulations to other HIPAA standards, including security, transactions and the appropriate use of service code sets.

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, extends certain of HIPAA’s obligations to parties providing services to healthcare entities covered by HIPAA known as “business associates,” imposes new notice of privacy breach reporting obligations, extends enforcement powers to state Attorneys General and amends the HIPAA privacy and security laws to strengthen the civil and criminal enforcement of HIPAA. HITECH establishes four categories of violations that reflect increasing levels of culpability, four corresponding tiers of penalty amounts that significantly increase the minimum penalty amount for each violation, and a maximum penalty amount of $1.5 million for all violations of an identical provision. With the additional HIPAA enforcement power under HITECH, the Office for Civil Rights of the DHHS and states are increasing their investigations and enforcement of HIPAA compliance. Our Healthcare Segments have taken steps to ensure compliance with HIPAA and we are monitoring compliance on an ongoing basis.

9

Additionally, the HITECH Final Rule imposes various requirements on covered entities and business associates, and expands the definition of “business associates” to cover contractors of business associates. Even when our Healthcare Segments are not operating as covered entities, they may be deemed to be “business associates” for HIPAA rule purposes of such covered entities. Our Healthcare Segments monitor their compliance obligations under HIPAA as modified by HITECH, and implement operational and systems changes, associate training and education, conduct risk assessments and allocate resources as needed. Any noncompliance with HIPAA requirements could expose such segments to the criminal and increased civil penalties provided under HITECH and require them to incur significant costs in order to seek to comply with its requirements or to remediate potential issues that may arise.

Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws

Federal law commonly known as the “Anti-Kickback Statute” prohibits the knowing and willful offer, solicitation, payment or receipt of anything of value (direct or indirect, overt or covert, in cash or in kind) which is intended to induce: the referral of an individual for a service for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs; or the ordering, purchasing, leasing, or arranging for, or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any service or item for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs.

Interpretations of the Anti-Kickback Statute have been very broad and under current Law, courts and federal regulatory authorities have stated that the Anti-Kickback Statute is violated if even one purpose (as opposed to the sole or primary purpose) of the arrangement is to induce referrals. Even bona fide investment interests in a healthcare provider may be questioned under the Anti-Kickback Statute if the government concludes that the opportunity to invest was offered as an inducement for referrals.

This act is subject to numerous statutory and regulatory “safe harbors.” Compliance with the requirements of a safe harbor offers defenses against Anti-Kickback Statute allegations. Failure of an arrangement to satisfy all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement is unlawful. However, it may mean that such an arrangement will be subject to scrutiny by the regulatory authorities.

Many states, including some where our Healthcare Segments do business, have adopted anti-kickback laws that are similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state laws are very closely patterned on the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; others, however, are broader and reach reimbursement by private payors. If our Healthcare Segments’ activities were deemed to be inconsistent with state anti-kickback or illegal remuneration laws, they could face civil and criminal penalties or be barred from such activities, any of which could harm such segments’ businesses.
If our Healthcare Segments’ arrangements are found to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or applicable state laws, these segments, along with their clients would be subject to civil and criminal penalties, and these segments’ arrangements would not be legally enforceable, which could materially and adversely affect their business. For more information on the risks related to failure to comply with applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, see “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks—Our segments’ business could be subject to civil penalties and loss of business if we fail to comply with applicable bribery, corruption and other regulations governing business with governments.”

Federal and State Self-Referral Prohibitions

Our Healthcare Segments may be subject to federal and state statutes banning payments for referrals of patients and referrals by physicians to healthcare providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship. Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, also known as the “Stark Law”, prohibits physicians from making a “referral” for “designated health services” for Medicare (and in many cases Medicaid) patients from entities or facilities in which such physicians directly or indirectly hold a “financial relationship”.

A financial relationship can take the form of a direct or indirect ownership, investment or compensation arrangement. A referral includes the request by a physician for, or ordering of, or the certifying or recertifying the need for, any designated health services.

Certain services that our Healthcare Segments provide may be identified as “designated health services” for purposes of the Stark Law. Such segments cannot provide assurance that future regulatory changes will not result in other services they provide becoming subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment or compensation prohibitions in the future.

Many states, including some states where our Healthcare Segments do business, have adopted similar or broader prohibitions against payments that are intended to induce referrals of clients. Moreover, many states where such segments operate 
10

have laws similar to the Stark Law prohibiting physician self-referrals. While our Healthcare Segments believe that they are operating in compliance with the Stark Law, there can be no guarantee that violations will not occur. 

Healthcare Reform

On March 23, 2010, the President of the United States signed into law comprehensive health reform through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 11-148) (“PPACA”). On March 30, 2010, the President signed a reconciliation budget bill that included amendments to the PPACA (Pub. L. 11-152). These laws in combination form the “ACA” referred to herein. The changes to various aspects of the healthcare system in the ACA were far-reaching and included, among many others, substantial adjustments to Medicare reimbursement, establishment of individual mandates for healthcare coverage, extension of coverage to certain populations, expansion of Medicaid, restrictions on physician-owned hospitals, and increased efficiency and oversight provisions.

Some of the provisions of the ACA took effect immediately, while others will take effect later or will be phased in over time, ranging from a few months following approval to ten years. Due to the complexity of the ACA, it is likely that additional legislation will be considered and enacted. The ACA requires the promulgation of regulations that will likely have significant effects on the healthcare industry and third-party payors. Thus, the healthcare industry and our operations may be subjected to significant new statutory and regulatory requirements and contractual terms and conditions, and consequently to structural and operational changes and challenges.

The ACA also implemented significant changes to healthcare fraud and abuse laws that intensify the risks and consequences of enforcement actions. These included expansion of the False Claims Act by: (a) narrowing the public disclosure bar; and (b) explicitly stating that violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute trigger false claims liability. In addition, the ACA lessened the intent requirements under the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person may violate the statute without knowledge or specific intent. The ACA also provided new funding and expanded powers to investigate fraud, including through expansion of the Medicare Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program to Medicare Parts C and D and Medicaid and authorizing the suspension of Medicare and Medicaid payments to a provider of services pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud. Finally, the legislation created enhanced penalties for noncompliance, including increased criminal penalties and expansion of administrative penalties under Medicare and Medicaid. Collectively, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our Healthcare Segments’ operations.

On January 20, 2017, the President of the United States issued an executive order that directed federal agencies to take steps to ensure the government’s implementation of the ACA minimizes the burden on impacted parties (such as individuals and states). The underlying intent of the executive order was to take the first steps to repeal and replace the ACA. The executive order specifically instructed agencies to “waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay implementation of provisions” that place a “fiscal burden on any State” or that impose a “cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden” on stakeholders including patients, providers, and insurers. The order stated that any changes should be made only to the extent “permitted by law” and should comply with the law governing administrative rule-making. The executive order did not, however, provide specifics on next steps or provisions that would be reexamined nor was it clear how the executive branch would be reconciled with Republican congressional efforts to repeal and replace the ACA or what portions of the ACA may continue in any replacement legislation. There are multiple pending legislative proposals to amend the ACA which, among other effects, could repeal all or parts of the ACA without replacing its extension of coverage to expansion populations. In addition, there are pending legislative proposals to materially restructure Medicaid and other government health care programs and there is litigation challenging, amongst other claims, the constitutionality of the ACA. Most recently, on December 14, 2018, a federal district court judge in Texas issued a widely anticipated opinion that struck down the entire ACA as unconstitutional. The judge ruled in favor of the plaintiffs by determining that the ACA’s individual mandate is no longer a tax and is therefore an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority. The judge also found that the individual mandate could not be severed from the rest of the ACA, rendering the entire ACA, not just the guaranteed issue and community rating provisions, unconstitutional. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia intervened as defendants in Texas v. United States to proffer a defense of the constitutionality of the ACA. The DOJ declined to defend the ACA on constitutional grounds. The intervenor defendant states have announced they will appeal the District Court’s decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. We are not able to predict the outcome of this matter nor are we able to predict the impact of a full or partial invalidation of the ACA.
In 2017, legislation was proposed in the U.S. Congress, but did not advance out of committee and was not passed, which would reduce or eliminate certain non-emergency medical transportation services provided by NET Services as a required Medicaid benefit. A similar proposal was made in 2018 by the President of the United States in a federal budget proposal. If additional privatization initiatives are not proposed or enacted, or if previously enacted privatization initiatives are challenged, repealed or invalidated, there could be a material adverse impact on our segments’ operating results.

Surveys and Audits

Our Healthcare Segments’ programs are subject to periodic surveys by government authorities or their contractors to ensure compliance with various requirements. Regulators conducting periodic surveys often provide reports containing statements of deficiencies for alleged failures to comply with various regulatory requirements. In most cases, if a deficiency finding is made by a reviewing agency, our segments will work with the reviewing agency to agree upon the steps to be taken to bring our program into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In some cases, however, an agency may take a number of adverse actions against a program, including:
•the imposition of fines or penalties or the recoupment of amounts paid;
•temporary suspension of admission of new clients to our program’s service;
•in extreme circumstances, exclusion from participation in Medicaid, Medicare or other programs;
•revocation of our license; or
•contract termination.

While our Healthcare Segments believe that our programs are in compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other program certification requirements and state licensure requirements, failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on such segments’ businesses and their ability to enter into contracts with other agencies to provide services.

Billing/claims Reviews and Audits

Agencies and other third-party commercial payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment medical reviews or other audits of our Healthcare Segments’ claims or other audits in conjunction with their obligations to comply with the requirements of Medicare or Medicaid. In order to conduct these reviews, payors request documentation from our Healthcare Segments and then review that documentation to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the eligibility of clients to receive benefits, the appropriateness of the care provided to those clients, and the documentation of that care. Any determination that such segments have not complied with applicable rules and regulations could result in adjustment of payments or the incurrence of fines and penalties, or in situations of significant compliance failures review or non-renewal of related contracts.
Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting

Some states in which our Healthcare Segments operate prohibit general business entities, such as these segments, from “practicing medicine,” which definition varies from state to state and can include employing physicians, as well as engaging in fee-splitting arrangements with these healthcare providers. Among other things, our Healthcare Segments currently contract with and employ NPs to perform CHAs. We believe that such segments have structured their operations appropriately; however, they could be alleged or found to be in violation of some or all of these laws. If a state determines that some portion of our Healthcare Segments’ businesses violate these laws, it may seek to have such segments discontinue or restructure those portions of their operations or subject them to increased costs, penalties, fines, certain license requirements or other measures. Any determination that such segments have acted improperly in this regard may result in liability to them. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the professional may be considered void and unenforceable.
Professional Licensure and Other Requirements

Many of our Healthcare Segments’ employees are subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing the ethics and practice of their professions. For example, our mid-level practitioners (e.g., NPs) are subject to state laws requiring physician supervision and state laws governing mid-level scope of practice. As physicians’ use of mid-level practitioners increases, state governing boards are implementing more robust regulations governing mid-levels and their scope of practice under physician supervision. Our Healthcare Segments’ ability to provide mid-level practitioner services may be restricted by the enactment of new state laws governing mid-level scope of practice and by state agency interpretations and enforcement of such existing laws. In addition, services rendered by mid-level practitioners may not be reimbursed by payors at the same rates as payors may reimburse physicians for the same services. Lastly, professionals who are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid as individual providers must not have been excluded from participation in government programs at any time. Our Healthcare Segments’ ability to provide services depends upon the ability of their personnel to meet individual licensure and other requirements and maintain such licensure in good standing.
