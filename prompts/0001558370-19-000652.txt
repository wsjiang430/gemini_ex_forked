 The Company sells most of its glass container products directly to customers under annual or multi‑year supply agreements. Multi‑year contracts typically provide for price adjustments based on cost changes. The Company also sells some of its products through distributors. Many customers provide the Company with regular estimates of their product needs, which enables the Company to schedule glass container production to maintain reasonable levels of inventory. Glass container manufacturing facilities are generally located in close proximity to customers.
 Markets and Competitive Conditions
 The Company’s principal markets for glass container products are in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.
 Americas. The Company has 35 glass container manufacturing plants in the Americas region located in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, the U.S. and interests in three joint ventures that manufacture glass containers. Also, the Company has a distribution facility in the U.S. used to import glass containers from its business in Mexico. The Company has the leading share of the glass container segment of the U.S. rigid packaging market, based on sales revenue by domestic producers. In South America and Mexico, the Company maintains a diversified portfolio serving several markets, including alcoholic beverages (beer, wine and spirits), non-alcoholic beverages and food, as well as a large infrastructure for returnable/refillable glass containers.  
 The principal glass container competitors in the U.S. are the Ardagh Group and Anchor Glass Container. Imports from China, Mexico, Taiwan and other countries also compete in U.S. glass container segments. Additionally, there are several major consumer packaged goods companies that self‑manufacture glass containers.  The Company competes directly with Verallia in Brazil and Argentina, and does not believe that it competes with any other large, multinational glass container manufacturers in the rest of the region. 
 Europe. The Company has a leading share of the glass container segment of the rigid packaging market in the European countries in which it operates, with 34 glass container manufacturing plants located in the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. These plants primarily produce glass containers for the alcoholic beverages (beer, wine and spirits), non-alcoholic beverages and food markets in these countries. The Company also has interests in two joint ventures that manufacture glass containers in Italy. Throughout Europe, the Company competes directly with a variety of glass container manufacturers including Verallia, Ardagh Group, Vetropack, Vidrala and BA Vidro.
 Asia Pacific. The Company has eight glass container manufacturing plants in the Asia Pacific region, located in Australia, China, Indonesia and New Zealand. It also has interests in joint venture operations in China, Malaysia and Vietnam. In Asia Pacific, the Company primarily produces glass containers for the alcoholic beverages (primarily beer and wine), non-alcoholic beverages and food markets. The Company competes directly with Orora Limited in Australia, and does not believe that it competes with any other large, multinational glass container manufacturers in the rest of the region. In China, the glass container segments of the packaging market are regional and highly fragmented with a large number of local competitors.
 In addition to competing with other large and well‑established manufacturers in the glass container segment, the Company competes in all regions with manufacturers of other forms of rigid packaging, principally aluminum cans and plastic containers. Competition is based on quality, price, service, innovation and the marketing attributes of the container. The principal competitors producing metal containers include Ball Corporation, Crown Holdings, Inc., and Silgan Holdings Inc. The principal competitors producing plastic containers include Amcor, Consolidated Container Holdings, LLC, Reynolds Group Holdings Limited, Plastipak Packaging, Inc. and Silgan Holdings Inc. The Company also competes with manufacturers of non‑rigid packaging alternatives, including flexible pouches, aseptic cartons and bag‑in‑box containers.

 The Company seeks to provide products and services to customers ranging from large multinationals to small local breweries and wineries in a way that creates a competitive advantage for the Company. The Company believes that it is often the glass container partner of choice because of its innovation and branding capabilities, its global footprint and its expertise in manufacturing know‑how and process technology.
 Manufacturing
 The Company has 77 glass manufacturing plants. It constantly seeks to improve the productivity of these operations through the systematic upgrading of production capabilities, sharing of best practices among plants and effective training of employees.
 The Company also provides engineering support for its glass manufacturing operations through facilities located in the U.S., Australia, France, Poland and Peru.
 Suppliers and Raw Materials
 The primary raw materials used in the Company’s glass container operations are sand, soda ash, limestone and recycled glass. Each of these materials, as well as the other raw materials used to manufacture glass containers, has historically been available in adequate supply from multiple sources. One of the sources is a soda ash mining operation in Wyoming in which the Company has a 25% interest. Energy
 The Company’s glass container operations require a continuous supply of significant amounts of energy, principally natural gas, fuel oil and electrical power. Adequate supplies of energy are generally available at all of the Company’s manufacturing locations. Energy costs typically account for 10-20% of the Company’s total manufacturing costs, depending on the cost of energy, the type of energy available, the factory location and the particular energy requirements. The percentage of total cost related to energy can vary significantly because of volatility in market prices, particularly for natural gas and fuel oil in volatile markets such as North America and Europe.
 In the Americas’ businesses in the U.S. and Canada, more than 90% of the sales volume is represented by customer contracts that contain provisions that pass the commodity price of natural gas to the customer, effectively reducing the region’s exposure to changing natural gas market prices. In the Americas’ business in South America and Mexico, the Company primarily enters into fixed price contracts for its energy requirements in most of the countries in which it operates and the remaining energy requirements are subject to changing natural gas market prices and economic impacts. These fixed price contracts typically have terms of one to ten years, and generally include annual price adjustments for inflation and for certain contracts price adjustments for foreign currency variation.
 In Europe and Asia Pacific, the Company enters into long term contracts for a significant amount of its energy requirements. These contracts have terms that range from one to five years. 
 Also, in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in market prices for natural gas, the Company uses commodity forward contracts related to its forecasted requirements. The objective of these forward contracts is to reduce potential volatility in cash flows and expense due to changing market prices. The Company continually evaluates the energy markets with respect to its forecasted energy requirements to optimize its use of commodity forward contracts.

 Research, Development and Engineering
 Research, development and engineering constitute important parts of the Company’s technical activities.  The Company primarily focuses on advancements in the areas of product innovation, manufacturing process control, melting technology, automatic inspection, light‑weighting and further automation of manufacturing activities. Recently, the Company has increased its focus on advancing melting technology with investments in modular glass melting furnaces.  The Company’s investments in this new technology seeks to reduce the amount of capital required to install, rebuild and operate its furnaces.  This new melting technology is also focused on the ability of these assets to be more easily turned on and off or adjusted based on seasonality and customer demands.  The Company’s research and development activities are conducted principally at its corporate facilities in Perrysburg, Ohio.
 The Company holds a large number of patents related to a wide variety of products and processes and has a substantial number of patent applications pending. While the aggregate of the Company’s patents are of material importance to its businesses, the Company does not consider that any patent or group of patents relating to a particular product or process is of material importance when judged from the standpoint of any individual segment or its businesses as a whole.
 The Company has agreements to license its proprietary glass container technology and to provide technical assistance to a limited number of companies around the world. These agreements cover areas related to manufacturing and engineering assistance. The worldwide licensee network provides a stream of revenue to help support the Company’s development activities. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company earned $13 million, $11 million and $13 million, respectively, in royalties and net technical assistance revenue.
 Sustainability and the Environment
 The Company is committed to reducing the impact its products and operations have on the environment. As part of this commitment, the Company has set targets for increasing the use of recycled glass in its manufacturing process, while reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2”) emissions. Specific actions taken by the Company include working with governments and other organizations to establish and financially support recycling initiatives, partnering with other entities throughout the supply chain to improve the effectiveness of recycling efforts, reducing the weight of glass packaging and investing in research and development to reduce energy consumption in its manufacturing process. The Company invests in technology and training to improve safety, reduce energy use, decrease emissions and increase the amount of cullet, or recycled glass, used in the production process.
 The Company’s worldwide operations, in addition to other companies within the industry, are subject to extensive laws, ordinances, regulations and other legal requirements relating to environmental protection, including legal requirements governing investigation and clean‑up of contaminated properties as well as water discharges, air emissions, waste management and workplace health and safety. The Company strives to abide by and uphold such laws and regulations.
 Glass Recycling and Bottle Deposits
 The Company is an important contributor to recycling efforts worldwide and is among the largest users of recycled glass containers. If sufficient high‑quality recycled glass were available on a consistent basis, the Company has the technology to make glass containers containing a high proportion of recycled glass. Using recycled glass in the manufacturing process reduces energy costs and impacts the operating life and efficiency of the glass melting furnaces.
 In the U.S., Canada, Europe and elsewhere, government authorities have adopted or are considering legal requirements that would mandate certain recycling rates, the use of recycled materials, or limitations on or preferences for certain types of packaging. The Company believes that governments worldwide will continue to develop and enact legal requirements guiding customer and end‑consumer packaging choices.

 Sales of beverage containers are affected by governmental regulation of packaging, including deposit laws and extended producer responsibility regulations. As of December 31, 2018, there were a number of U.S. states, Canadian provinces and territories, European countries and Australian states with some form of incentive for consumer returns of glass bottles in their law. The structure and enforcement of such laws and regulations can impact the sales of beverage containers in a given jurisdiction. Such laws and regulations also impact the availability of post‑consumer recycled glass for the Company to use in container production.
 A number of states and provinces have recently considered or are now considering laws and regulations to encourage curbside, deposit and on premise glass recycling. Although there is no clear trend in the direction of these state and provincial laws and proposals, the Company believes that states and provinces, as well as municipalities within those jurisdictions, will continue to adopt recycling laws, which will impact supplies of recycled glass. As a large user of recycled glass for making new glass containers, the Company has an interest in laws and regulations impacting supplies of such material in its markets.
 Air Emissions
 In Europe, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (“EUETS”) is in effect to facilitate emissions reduction. The Company’s manufacturing facilities which operate in EU countries must restrict the volume of their CO2 emissions to the level of their individually allocated emissions allowances as set by country regulators. If the actual level of emissions for any facility exceeds its allocated allowance, additional allowances can be bought to cover deficits; conversely, if the actual level of emissions for any facility is less than its allocation, the excess allowances can be sold. Should the regulators significantly restrict the number of emissions allowances available, it could have a material effect on the Company’s results.
 In the Americas, the U.S. and Canada have engaged in significant legislative and regulatory activities relating to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions for years at the federal, state and provincial levels of government.  In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) regulates emissions of GHG air pollutants under the Clean Air Act, which grants the EPA authority to establish limits for certain air pollutants and to require compliance, levy penalties and bring civil judicial action against violators.  The EPA’s GHG regulations continue to evolve, as the structure and scope of the regulations are often the subject of litigation and federal legislative activity.  New GHG regulations could have a significant long‑term impact on the Company’s operations that are affected by such regulations.  The state of California in the U.S. the Canadian federal government and the province of Quebec have adopted cap‑and‑trade legislation aimed at reducing GHG emissions.  In Brazil, the government passed a law in 2009 requiring companies to reduce the level of GHG emissions by the year 2020.  In other South American countries, national and local governments are also considering potential regulations to reduce GHG emissions.
 In Asia Pacific, the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 commenced on July 1, 2008 in Australia and established a mandatory reporting system for corporate GHG emissions and energy production and consumption. In July 2014, the Australian government introduced the Emissions Reduction Fund (“ERF”) which comprises an element to credit emissions reductions, a fund to purchase emissions reductions and a safeguard mechanism. The ERF purchases the lowest cost abatement (in the form of Australian carbon credit units) from a wide range of sources, providing an incentive to businesses, households and landowners to proactively reduce their emissions, while the safeguard mechanism (effective from July 1, 2016) ensures that emissions reductions paid for through the crediting and purchasing elements of the ERF are not offset by significant increases in emissions above business-as-usual levels elsewhere in the economy. An emissions trading scheme has been in effect in New Zealand since 2008.
 The Company is unable to predict what environmental legal requirements may be adopted in the future. However, the Company continually monitors its operations in relation to environmental impacts and invests in environmentally friendly and emissions‑reducing projects. As such, the Company has made significant expenditures for environmental improvements at certain of its facilities over the last several years; however, these expenditures did not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. The Company is unable to predict the impact of future environmental legal requirements on its results of operations or cash flows.

 Employees
 The Company’s worldwide operations employed approximately 26,500 persons as of December 31, 2018. Approximately 68% of employees in the U.S. and Canada are hourly workers covered by collective bargaining agreements. The principal collective bargaining agreement, which at December 31, 2018, covered approximately 77% of the Company’s union‑affiliated employees in the U.S. and Canada, will expire on March 31, 2019. Approximately 71% of employees in South America and Mexico are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The majority of the hourly workers in Australia and New Zealand are also covered by collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining agreements in South America, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand have varying terms and expiration dates. In Europe, a large number of the Company’s employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the U.S. Such employment rights require the Company to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. The Company considers its employee relations to be good and does not anticipate any material work stoppages in the near term. Available Information
