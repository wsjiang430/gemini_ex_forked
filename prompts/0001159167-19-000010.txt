Overview
iRobot Corporation ("iRobot" or the "Company" or "we") is a leading global consumer robot company that designs and builds robots that empower people to do more both inside and outside of the home. The Company's consumer robots help people find smarter ways to clean and accomplish more in their daily lives. iRobot's portfolio of solutions features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation, human-robot interaction, and physical solutions. Leveraging this portfolio, iRobot's engineers are building an ecosystem of robots to empower the smart home. For more than 25 years, we have been a pioneer in the robotics and consumer products industries. 
Since our founding in 1990, we have developed expertise in the disciplines necessary to design and build durable, high-performance and cost-effective robots through the close integration of software, electronics and hardware. Our core technologies serve as reusable building blocks that we adapt and expand to develop next-generation and new products, reducing the time, cost and risk associated with product development. Our significant expertise in consumer needs, robot design, engineering and smart home technologies and trends positions us to capitalize on the growth we expect in the market for robot-based consumer products.
Over the past seventeen years, we have sold more than 25 million consumer robots worldwide. During 2016, we took several steps to become more focused on our well-established consumer robot business in order to capitalize on the substantial opportunities available to us within consumer markets. 2016 was a pivotal year for iRobot as we exited our non-consumer businesses to focus solely on products for the home. In the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of our defense and security business and exited the remote presence business. These actions were taken to solidify our position as the leader in diversified consumer robots and to focus on key technologies, with an emphasis on software, that allow our robots to more effectively understand the homes in which they operate. 
During 2017, we expanded our global operations with the acquisition of two of our major distributors in Japan and Europe. On April 3, 2017, we closed the acquisition of the iRobot-related distribution business of Sales On Demand Corporation ("SODC") based in Tokyo, Japan for approximately $16.6 million in cash. On October 2, 2017, we closed the acquisition of our largest European distributor, Robopolis SAS ("Robopolis"), a French company, for a final purchase price, following adjustments for working capital pursuant to the agreement with Robopolis, of $169.4 million in cash, net of acquired cash of $38.0 million. This provided us more direct control of 75% of our global revenue through a direct presence in countries including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. 
In 2018, iRobot sold more than $1 billion in consumer robots. The Company capitalized on incremental investments in research and development made and introduced new products in 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, iRobot introduced the Roomba i7 and i7+ in the U.S., robot vacuums that remember a home's floor plan and clean specific rooms by name. Ushering in a new era of consumer robots, the Roomba i7+ allows customers to clean specific rooms in the home. Using Imprint™ Smart Mapping, the Roomba i7+ learns the home's floor plan, giving customers total control to choose which rooms to clean and when. When the Roomba i7+ robot vacuum is finished cleaning, it empties its own dust bin into the Clean Base™, which holds 30 bins of dirt, allowing customers to forget about vacuuming for weeks at a time. 
The Roomba i7 and i7+ further extend our product ecosystem, bringing a new level of intelligence and automation to robotic vacuum cleaners with the ability to learn, map and adapt to a home's floor plan. In the third quarter of 2018, we also introduced the Roomba e5 in the U.S., a highly-featured product at a more accessible price, to our lineup. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we also introduced the Roomba e5 in markets outside of the U.S. in advance of the holiday season.

Our total revenue for 2018 was $1,092.6 million, which represents a 23.6% increase from 2017 revenue of $883.9 million. Domestic revenue grew $108.4 million, primarily as a result of strong sales of the Roomba 900 and 600 series robots, as well as the significant investments in advertising media and national promotions. International revenue grew by $100.2 million in 2018 with increases in most markets.
Our financial performance in 2019 will be driven by our continued focus as a leading global consumer robots company. Our strategy is to maintain Roomba’s leadership in the robotic vacuum cleaner segment while positioning the Company as a strategic player in the emerging smart home. We expect growth to be driven by:

• | deeper household penetration of Roomba globally;


• | broader roll out of the Roomba i7 and i7+ which were launched in the U.S. in 2018;


• | continued investment in innovation to extend our technology and product leadership;


• | further adoption of Braava products through targeted marketing programs; and


• | introduction of additional new products mid-year in 2019.

Strategy
In 2002, iRobot created the home robot cleaning category with the introduction of its Roomba vacuuming robot. Today, we are a global enterprise that has sold more than 25 million consumer robots worldwide. iRobot’s success in driving adoption of connected Roomba robots has created a unique opportunity to extend consumer value in the home and expand our business. Our long-term strategy is to increase the penetration of our products in existing markets, expand current products into new markets, and develop and launch new products into current and new markets. We estimate household penetration of iRobot products to be 11% in the U.S. and in the single digits globally. We believe that the current trend towards smart home and product integration provides us with a significant opportunity for product revenue growth. As our customer base grows, iRobot plans to create an ecosystem of connected robots designed to integrate with other devices. This ecosystem will create greater possibilities for new features and capacities and empower the smart home.
Global expansion is a key component of our strategy. Our relentless pursuit of product leadership, through targeted investment in key technologies and capabilities, coupled with our investments in furthering our global brand and targeted marketing initiatives, allows us to continue to maintain our leadership position in the robotic vacuum cleaner segment despite increasing competition. Our acquisitions of distributors in Japan and Europe furthered this strategic objective.
To successfully execute our 2019 plan and drive revenue diversification and significant revenue growth beyond 2019, we plan to continue to make investments in our business during the year. These investments are expected to help iRobot achieve the following goals:

• | Continue to strengthen our marketing capabilities globally and accelerate worldwide consumer adoption of Roomba to maintain our market-leading position in robotic vacuum cleaners;


• | Continue to develop our wet floor care business to generate a material, secondary revenue stream;


• | Launch iRobot Terra, an autonomous robotic lawn mower that will re-invent the robotic lawnmower category with state-of-the-art mapping and navigation technology. In 2019, iRobot plans to make Terra available for purchase in limited quantities in Germany and for beta testing in the U.S.;


• | Scale our infrastructure to support global operations and connected products;


• | Explore, develop and grow adjacent non-floor care consumer robot products that can generate meaningful diversified revenue streams; and


• | Make continued operational improvements that can reduce product and operating costs.

Key pillars of our strategy include:
Technology: As a leading global consumer robotics company, iRobot must develop and maintain best-in-class technology in the areas of cleaning, mapping and navigation. In 2019, iRobot plans to take steps towards expanding its product lines with new products that will deliver innovative solutions to improve cleaning performance, efficiency and ease-of-use. Mapping and navigation continues to be the core focus for iRobot. Consumer robots that can map and are spatially aware create a unique and differentiating opportunity to grow consumer value. 
Brand: iRobot enjoys consistently high brand awareness and high purchase intent in major markets around the world. Along with high awareness, consumers consider the iRobot brand and our products to be premium, innovative and of high quality. These favorable impressions come as a result of the millions of consumers around the world who own iRobot products and an even greater number who are aware of the brand through advertising and the positive word-of-mouth from existing owners.

Portfolio: Our strategy includes building a portfolio of investments, including physical platforms, digital and data capabilities, to diversify across domestic and foreign markets and delivering a steady progression of innovation and growth over time. To achieve this, we plan to focus on developing digital, data and physical products that continue to leverage connectivity and spatial intelligence to deliver meaningful benefits to users. In 2018, we launched Roomba i7 and i7+, introducing Imprint™ Smart Mapping, a smart mapping technology that allows users to control which rooms are cleaned and when. This new intelligence platform enables rapid-paced innovation to continuously deliver new intelligence-based features sets to iRobot consumers. The initial set of features enables the connected robots to communicate with consumers to help optimize their personal cleaning experience. The intelligence platform is focused on personalization, learning and prediction. Customers can now be informed when specific maintenance is needed, make suggestions on personalized cleaning schedules and optimize charging. 
Talent: Our employees are the most important driver of who we are. Our success, diversity and reputation as developers of great talent make us an attractive employer to the top talent all over the world. Talent recruitment and retention continues to be at the core of what we accomplish as we map out our culture and work towards achieving our vision. We are also growing our company to meet organization needs by strategically investing in our employees around the globe.
Technology 
In 2016, iRobot narrowed its focus to the consumer market and made increased, but disciplined investments in advancing mapping and navigation, and user interaction including cloud and app development and cleaning efficacy. From the launch of Braava jet, to the introduction of a lower cost Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, or vSLAM, solution in Roomba 960, these strategic investments in technology had an immediate impact on product diversification, performance and market expansion. In 2017, we introduced two new connected products to the product portfolio bringing the advantages of cloud connectivity to more consumers. With the iRobot HOME App, we also delivered our robots’ maps directly to our customers through the launch of post-mission cleaning maps. In 2018, we introduced three new connected products including a new intelligence platform with the ability to learn, map and adapt to a home’s floor plan, as well as empty its own dust bin into the Clean Base. We believe the improved performance of our connected robots, and the data sourced from our maps, will accelerate new product development and digital partnerships for the smart home. 
We plan to continue to leverage opportunities, enabled by our growing connected product portfolio, to invest in developing technologies and interfaces for our products to provide a convenient and personalized user experience. At the foundation of our effort to drive enhanced user experience has been the deployment of our new connectivity and cloud infrastructure through AWS. We made this investment to enable us to scale our connected products globally, with increased access to valuable cloud services and applications to support future product features, and to integrate with other devices in the smart home. iRobot plans to continue to identify additional ways to advance the smart home experience by enabling a broader understanding of the home’s space, enabled through Roomba’s spatial awareness of the home.
From robotic vacuum cleaning to mopping and lawn care, we are dedicated to developing market-leading solutions that provide compelling value to customers worldwide. From our customers' perspective, the core value of our robots is the ability to efficiently and effectively perform a physical mission - the task for which that robot was initially purchased. In addition, we focus on features that allow the robots to perform longer, without consumer interaction. Our goal is to deliver maximum autonomy and effectiveness of the mission.
Products
We sell various products that are designed for use in and around the home. Our current consumer products are focused on both indoor and outdoor cleaning applications. We believe our consumer products provide value to our customers by delivering a better way to clean and by freeing people from repetitive home cleaning tasks. To ensure the continued acceptance of our robots, we will continue to invest in technology necessary to further improve their capabilities.
The opportunity for robots working together to accomplish multiple tasks with little intervention from the user is expected to be a significant step forward. Consumers can already use third party integration software to operate Roomba. We believe the mapping and spatial awareness capabilities of our consumer robots will play an important role in allowing other smart devices in the home to more seamlessly work together and advance the next-generation smart home.
We currently offer multiple Roomba floor vacuuming robots at varying price points ranging from approximately $299 to $1,099 based upon features and performance characteristics. Roomba's design allows it to clean under toe kicks, beds and other furniture, resulting in cleaner floors since the Roomba can access more of the floor than standard upright vacuum cleaners. In addition, Roomba eliminates the need to manually vacuum for many users - it cleans automatically upon the push of a button or through scheduling.
In 2018, we launched several new robotic vacuum cleaners: 

• | Roomba i7 brings a new level of intelligence and automation to robotic vacuum cleaners with the ability to learn, map and adapt to a home’s floor plan;

5


• | Roomba i7+ includes all the features of i7 plus the ability for the robot to empty its own bin into the Clean Base with Automatic Dirt Disposal. This brings a level of automation that allows users to forget about vacuuming for weeks at a time; and


• | Roomba e5 is an affordable, highly-featured product which includes WiFi connectivity, intelligent navigation with Dirt Detect technologies and iRobot’s dual multi-surface rubber brushes.

In addition to the newly launched products, we continue to offer an assortment of other robotic vacuum cleaner offerings. Roomba 900 series robots help keep floors cleaner throughout the entire home with intelligent visual navigation and iRobot HOME App control with wireless connectivity. The Roomba 800 series robots offer our AEROForce technology which incorporates brushless, counter-rotating extractors that amplify suction for superior performance over bristle brushes, while requiring less maintenance than previous Roomba models. The Roomba 600 series robots offer a three-stage cleaning system which thoroughly vacuums every section of the floor multiple times, as well as an improved brush design enabling the robot to better handle fibers like hair, pet fur, lint and carpet fuzz.
We currently offer the Braava family of automatic floor mopping robots designed exclusively for hard-surface floors. These robots provide a different cleaning approach than our Roomba products. The Braava robots, priced at $199 and $299, automatically dust and damp mop hard-surface floors using popular cleaning cloths or our specially designed reusable microfiber cloths, and include a special reservoir that dispenses liquid throughout the cleaning cycle to keep the cloth damp. Braava jet works with Braava jet Cleaning Pads to tackle a range of hard-floor cleaning jobs, from wet mopping and damp sweeping to simple dusting. 
Our Mirra Pool Cleaning Robot is used to clean residential pools and removes debris as small as two microns from pool floors, walls and stairs. Mirra is brought to market under the iRobot brand through a relationship with Aquatron, Inc., which develops and manufactures the pool cleaning robots.
In 2019, we plan to capitalize on the incremental investments we made in 2017 and 2018 with the introduction of Terra, and additional new products midyear 2019. In January 2019, we announced Terra, an autonomous robotic lawn mower that we believe will revolutionize the robotic lawnmower category with state-of-the-art mapping and navigation technology. Terra mows like people do, intelligently navigating the yard and cutting efficiently in systematic rows. We plan to make Terra available in limited quantities for purchase in Germany and for beta testing in the U.S. in 2019. 
Strategic Alliances
In addition to our internal technology development, we leverage relevant robotic technologies through licensing, acquisitions, venture investments and/or other partnerships. These strategic alliances are an important part of our product development, advanced research and distribution strategies. We rely on strategic alliances to provide technology and complementary product offerings to drive market adoption of our robotic products. 
We seek to form relationships with organizations that can provide best-in-class technology or market advantages for establishing iRobot technology. This includes expanded collaborations with other smart home technologies that may leverage spatial understanding from our products to provide end users with a more intuitive and personalized smart home experience. 
Sales and Distribution Channels
We sell our consumer products through distributor and retail sales channels, as well as our online store. For the fiscal years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, sales to non-U.S. customers accounted for 48.7%, 48.8%, and 51.2% of total revenue, respectively. For the fiscal years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, the Company generated 17.3% and 13.5% of total revenue from one of its retailers (Amazon), respectively. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Company generated 12.9%, 12.3% and 10.4% of total revenue from SODC, Robopolis, and Amazon, respectively. In April 2017, the Company acquired the iRobot-related distribution business of SODC, and in October 2017, the Company acquired Robopolis.
In the United States and Canada, we sell our consumer products primarily through a network of national retailers. Certain smaller domestic retail operations are supported by distributors to whom we sell our products directly. With the acquisition of SODC and Robopolis, iRobot now directly services retailers in Japan and countries that were previously serviced by Robopolis, including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. In support of sales in the United States, Canada, Japan and the seven European countries previously serviced by Robopolis, we maintain in-house sales, marketing and product management teams. In China, retailers are serviced by two local distributors. Due to the special needs of this market, we maintain a local sales, marketing and product team to support the distributors, manage the local marketing plan and meet product needs. Throughout the rest of the world, our products are sold primarily through a network of in-country distributors who resell to retail stores in their respective countries. These distributors are supported by our international sales and product marketing team.
6

Our retail and distributor networks are our primary distribution channels for our products. We have established valuable databases and customer lists that allow us to target directly those consumers most likely to purchase a new robot or upgrade. With Wi-Fi connectivity implemented across Roomba 690 and higher models, iRobot can more directly provide customer support via the iRobot HOME App. In addition, connectivity enables us to provide direct marketing material and push new features/fixes to robots in the field. We believe we maintain a close connection with our customers in each of our markets, which provides an enhanced position from which to improve our distribution and product offerings.
Customer Service and Support
We also provide ongoing customer service and support. Consumer customer service representatives, the majority of whom are employees of outsourced service organizations or our distribution partners, are extensively trained on the technical intricacies of our consumer products. Because of the connected nature of our new robot technology, our customer service representatives are able to access robot information remotely to identify issues and behaviors relevant in troubleshooting and address customer questions and concerns. 
Marketing and Brand
We market our consumer robots to end-user customers through our extensive network of retail partners with the support of our sales and marketing teams as well as in collaborations with in-country distributors. In addition, we sell directly to consumers through iRobot's e-commerce channels around the world. For consumers seeking information about our products, the iRobot website showcases our brand, allows consumers to learn more about our Roomba and Braava products, including the latest product innovations, and enables direct-to-consumer sales. The website also plays an important after-sales role for owners seeking spare parts and accessories, as well as a location for useful FAQ’s and trouble-shooting solutions. 
Our marketing strategy is to drive consumer awareness and interest in Roomba robot vacuums and Braava robot mops. Our sales and marketing expenses represented 19.3%, 18.3% and 17.4% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in national advertising, consumer and industry trade shows, direct marketing and public relations to further build brand awareness.
In 2017, iRobot launched our first ever Braava national television advertising campaign in the U.S., and category revenue grew 65% in 2017 over full-year 2016. In 2018, the momentum generated by this campaign continued driving U.S. revenue growth. We have built a trusted, recognized brand by providing high-quality robots. Customer word-of-mouth has been a significant driver of our brand's success to date. iRobot owner loyalty encourages repurchase, and positive customer experiences inspire others to adopt our products. Our marketing, public relations and consumer service efforts fuel this word-of-mouth momentum.
In April 2017, we acquired SODC, launching four new iRobot offices in Japan. In October 2017, we acquired our largest European distributor, Robopolis, launching new iRobot offices in seven countries, including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. These acquisitions afford us greater control and consistency in our approach to all market activities including sales, marketing, branding, channel relationships and customer service. 
Manufacturing
Our core competencies are the design, development and marketing of robots. Our manufacturing strategy is to outsource non-core competencies, such as the production of our robots, to third-party entities skilled in manufacturing. By relying on the outsourced manufacture of our robots, we can focus our engineering expertise on the design of robots and associated technologies.
Manufacturing a new product requires a close relationship between our product designers and the manufacturing organizations. Using multiple engineering techniques, our products are introduced to the selected production facility at an early-development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before tooling is finalized and mass production begins. As a result, we believe that we can significantly reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries, with improved quality and yields.
We outsource the manufacturing of our consumer products to three contract manufacturers, each of which manufactures our robots at a single plant in Southern China. In addition, one of our contract manufactures plans to begin partial production outside of China beginning in 2019. Our production processes give us the capacity to produce up to 20,000 robots a day, helping us to meet demand for peak seasons. 
Under our agreements with our contract manufacturers, manufacturers supply us with specified quantities of products that align with demand forecasts that we establish based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions.

Research and Development
We believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to develop new products and product accessories, and enhancements to and applications for our existing products. For the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our research and development expenses were $140.6 million, $113.1 million and $79.8 million, or 12.9%, 12.8% and 12.1% of revenue, respectively. We intend to continue our investment in research and development to respond to and anticipate customer needs, and to enable us to introduce new products over the next few years that will continue to address our existing and adjacent market sectors.
Our research and development is conducted by teams dedicated to particular projects. Our research and development efforts are primarily located at our headquarters in Bedford, Massachusetts and our office in Pasadena, California.
Competition
The market for robots is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to changing technologies, shifting customer needs and expectations and the likely increased introduction of new products. A number of established companies have developed or are developing robots that will compete directly with our product offerings, and many of our competitors have significantly more financial and other resources than we possess. Our competitors include consumer electronics companies such as Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, Cecotec and Shark, traditional floor cleaning brands with robotic offerings such as Dyson, Bissell and Hoover; and firms primarily focused on robotic cleaning such as Ecovacs and iLife.
While we believe many of our customers purchase our Roomba floor vacuuming robots and Braava mopping robots as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, their traditional vacuum cleaners and wet floor cleaning methods, we do compete in some cases with providers of traditional cleaning products.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market for robots include product features, performance for the intended mission, cost of purchase, total cost of system operation, including maintenance and support, ease of use, integration with existing equipment, quality, reliability, customer support, brand and reputation.
Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product development and customer support. We cannot provide assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering the markets in which we provide products.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our continued success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, the technical competence and ability of our employees to continue to innovate. The ownership of intellectual property rights is an important factor in our business. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents and has filed numerous additional patent applications. As of December 29, 2018, we held 460 U.S. patents, more than 800 foreign patents, additional design registrations, and more than 500 patent applications pending worldwide. While our U.S. patents will begin to expire in 2022, no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting our products. We will continue to file and prosecute patent (or design registration, as applicable) applications when and where appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. We also encourage our employees to continue to invent and develop new technologies so as to maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace. It is possible that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents for our pending patent applications or other inventions we seek to protect. In that regard, we sometimes permit certain intellectual property to lapse or go abandoned under appropriate circumstances. It is also possible that we may not develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are patentable, or that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will harm or altogether preclude our ability to do business.
Our registered U.S. trademarks include iRobot and its stylized logo, Roomba, NorthStar, Create, iAdapt, Aware, Home Base, Looj, Braava, Braava jet, AeroForce, Better Together, Mirra, vSLAM and Virtual Wall. Our marks iRobot, Roomba, Braava, Braava jet, Virtual Wall, and certain other trademarks, have also been registered in selected foreign countries.
Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may independently develop technology that is similar to ours. Legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Some of our competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and low-cost structures while infringing on our intellectual property. In 2017, we initiated a multi-party litigation at the U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC") as well as in federal district court in Massachusetts based on claims of patent infringement. In November 2018, the ITC issued a Notice of Final Determination confirming that U.S. Patent No. 9,038,233 is valid and infringed, and that the infringing products for bObsweep, Inc., bObsweep USA, Hoover, and 
8

Shenzhen Silver Star Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. should be barred from importation into the United States. Prior to the issuance of the Final Determination, iRobot entered into confidential settlements with Shenzhen Zhiyi Technology Co. Ltd. d/b/a iLife, Micro-Star International, Black & Decker, and Matsutek. There is no guarantee that we will prevail on other patent infringement claims against third parties. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace. In addition, if any of our products or the technology underlying our products is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. We have received in the past communications from third parties relating to technologies used in our various robot products that have alleged infringement of patents or violation of other intellectual property rights. Some of these allegations have resulted in actions filed against iRobot in foreign jurisdictions. In response to these communications, we have contacted these third parties to convey our good faith belief that we do not infringe the patents in question or otherwise violate those parties' rights. Where an action has been filed, we will defend iRobot against the allegations. We cannot assure you that we will not receive further correspondence from these parties, not be subject to additional allegations of infringement from others, and cannot assure you that iRobot will prevail in any ongoing or subsequently filed actions. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Moreover, any settlement of or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. Any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we attempt to design around the technology at issue or to find another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering applicable software or product solutions, our continued supply of software or product solutions could be disrupted or our introduction of new or enhanced software or products could be significantly delayed.
Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced higher revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year due in large part to seasonal holiday demand. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our second-half consumer product revenue represented 59.4%, 60.2% and 57.5% of our annual consumer product revenue, respectively. We have also experienced higher selling and marketing expenses in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year due to increase marketing campaigns to support seasonal holiday demand. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our second-half selling and marketing expense represented 63.3%, 61.3% and 57.4% of our annual selling and marketing expense, respectively.
Regulations
Our business requires compliance with a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection, and data security. In particular, we are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other user data. In addition, the global nature of our business operations also creates various domestic and foreign regulatory challenges and subject us to laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions. Our products are also subject to U.S. export controls, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. 
The laws in each of these areas - in particular those related to data privacy - are continually changing and evolving in unpredictable ways. New laws and regulations in any of these areas, as well as compliance with these laws (and their derivatives) may have an adverse effect on our business. If we fail to comply with these laws, we may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties. 
We are also subject to international and U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, regulate energy efficiency and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. We believe that our policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and associated financial liability. To date, environmental control regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on our overall operations.
Prior to our divestiture of the defense and security business unit in April 2016, we were subject to various government regulations, including various U.S. federal government regulations as a contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. federal government.
