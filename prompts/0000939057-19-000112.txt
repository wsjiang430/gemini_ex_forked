Item 1.  Business
Security Federal Corporation
Security Federal Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in July 1987 for the purpose of becoming the savings and loan holding company for Security Federal Bank ("Security Federal" or the "Bank") upon the Bank's conversion from mutual to stock form (the "Conversion").  Effective August 17, 1998, the Company changed its state of incorporation from Delaware to South Carolina.  On December 28, 2011, the Company reorganized into a bank holding company in connection with the Bank's conversion from a federally chartered stock savings bank to a South Carolina chartered commercial bank. As a result of the reorganization, the Federal Reserve became the Company's primary federal regulator. 
As a South Carolina corporation, the Company is authorized to engage in any activity permitted by South Carolina General Corporation Law.  The Company is a one bank holding company.  Through the bank holding company structure, it is possible to expand the size and scope of the financial services offered beyond those currently offered by the Bank.  The holding company structure also provides the Company with greater flexibility than the Bank would have to diversify its business activities, through existing or newly formed subsidiaries, or through acquisitions or mergers of financial institutions as well as other companies.  There are no current arrangements, understandings or agreements regarding any such acquisition.  Future activities of the Company, other than the continuing operations of Security Federal, will be funded through dividends from Security Federal and through borrowings from third parties.  See "Regulation - Regulation of the Company - Dividends" and "Taxation." Activities of the Company may also be funded through sales of additional securities or income generated by other activities of the Company.  At this time, there are no plans regarding sales of additional securities or other activities.
At December 31, 2018, the Company had assets of $912.6 million, deposits of $767.5 million and shareholders' equity of $80.5 million.
The executive office of the Company is located at 238 Richland Avenue Northwest, Aiken, South Carolina 29801, and its telephone number is (803) 641-3000.
Security Federal Bank
General.  Security Federal is a South Carolina chartered commercial bank headquartered in Aiken, South Carolina.  Security Federal, with 16 branch offices in Aiken, Lexington, Richland and Saluda counties, South Carolina and Columbia County, Georgia, was originally chartered under the name Aiken Building and Loan Association on March 27, 1922.  It received its federal charter and changed its name to Security Federal Savings and Loan Association of Aiken on March 7, 1962, and later changed its name to Security Federal Savings Bank of South Carolina, on November 11, 1986.  Effective April 8, 1996, the Bank changed its name to Security Federal Bank.  The Bank converted from the mutual to the stock form of organization on October 30, 1987.  As mentioned above, effective December 28, 2011, Security Federal converted from a federally chartered stock savings bank to a South Carolina chartered commercial bank. As a result of the conversion to a South Carolina commercial bank, the Bank is regulated by the State Board and the FDIC. The Bank will open its 17th branch office in Augusta, Georgia in 2019. 
The principal business of Security Federal is accepting deposits from the general public and originating commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, consumer loans, as well as mortgage loans to buy or refinance one-to-four family residential real estate.  The Bank also originates construction loans on single-family residences, multi-family dwellings and projects, and commercial real estate, as well as loans for the acquisition, development and construction of residential subdivisions and commercial projects. In addition, the Bank operates Security Federal Trust and Investments, a division of the Bank that offers trust, financial planning and financial management services. 
Security Federal has one active wholly owned subsidiary, Security Federal Insurance Inc. ("SFINS"), which is an insurance agency subsidiary that offers auto, business, health and home insurance. SFINS also has a wholly owned subsidiary, Collier Jennings Financial Corporation, which has three wholly owned subsidiaries: Security Federal Auto Insurance, The Auto Insurance Store Inc., and Security Federal Premium Pay Plans Inc.  Security Federal Premium Pay Plans Inc. has one wholly owned insurance premium finance subsidiary and also has an ownership interest in four other insurance premium finance subsidiaries. Security Federal also has one inactive subsidiary, Security Financial Services Corporation.
Security Federal's income is derived primarily from interest and fees earned in connection with its lending activities, and its principal expenses are interest paid on savings deposits and borrowings and operating expenses.

In addition to interest earned on loans, the Bank receives loan origination fees or "points" for originating loans.  Loan origination points are a percentage of the principal amount of the loan which are charged to the borrower for the creation of the loan.  The Bank's loan origination fees are generally 1% on conventional residential mortgages, and 0.25% to 1% on commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans.  
Total fee income (including amounts amortized to income as yield adjustments) received by the Bank from loan originations was $726,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Loan origination and commitment fees are volatile sources of income.  These fees vary with the volume and type of loans and commitments made and purchased and with competitive conditions in mortgage markets, which in turn are governed by the demand for and availability of money.
The following table shows deferred mortgage loan origination fees recognized as income by the Bank expressed as a percentage of the dollar amount of total mortgage loans originated (and retained in the Bank's portfolio) and purchased during the periods indicated and the dollar amount of deferred loan origination fees at the end of each respective period.

The Bank also receives other fees and charges related to existing loans, conversion fees, assumption fees, late charges and other fees collected in connection with a change in borrower or other loan modifications.
Security Federal currently sells substantially all conforming fixed rate loans with terms of 15 years or greater in the secondary mortgage market.  These loans are sold in order to provide a source of funds and as one of the strategies available to close the gap between the maturities of the Bank's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  Currently, most fixed rate, long-term mortgage loans are being originated based on Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") underwriting standards.
Secondary market sales are made to other banks or institutional investors.  Generally all loans sold to investors are without recourse.  For the past several years, substantially all loans have been sold on a servicing released basis. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Security Federal sold $45.3 million in fixed rate residential loans on a servicing released basis in the secondary market.  Loans closed but not yet settled with banks or other investors, are carried in the Bank's "loans held for sale" portfolio.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $1.8 million of loans held for sale.  These loans are fixed rate residential loans that have been originated in the Bank's name and have closed.  Virtually all of these loans have commitments to be purchased by investors and the majority of these loans were price locked with the investors on the same day or shortly after the loan was price locked with the Bank's customers.  Therefore, these loans present very little market risk for the Bank.  The Bank usually delivers loans to, and receives funding from, the investor within 30 days.  Security Federal originates all of its loans held for sale on a "best efforts" basis which means that the Bank suffers no penalty if it is unable to deliver a loan to a potential investor.
Federal law restricts the Bank's permissible lending limits to one borrower to the greater of $500,000 or 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank's legal lending limit under this restriction was $14.8 million.  At that date, the Bank's largest loan relationship to a single borrower was $11.7 million, comprised of three loans for commercial properties. These loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at December 31, 2018. South Carolina law restricts the Bank's permissible lending limits to one borrower to 10% of unimpaired capital unless prior approval is granted by a two-thirds vote of the Board of Directors, in which case the limit is increased to 15% of unimpaired capital.  During 2018, the Board approved an increase in the Bank's lending limit to a single borrower to 15% of unimpaired capital.

Loan Solicitation and Processing.  The Bank actively solicits mortgage loan applications from existing customers, real estate agents, builders, real estate developers and others.  The Bank also receives mortgage loan applications as a result of customer referrals and from walk-in customers. Detailed loan applications are obtained to determine the borrower's creditworthiness and ability to repay.  The more significant items on loan applications are verified through the use of credit reports, financial statements and confirmations. After analysis of the loan application and property or collateral involved, including an appraisal of the property (residential appraisals are obtained through independent fee appraisers), a lending decision is made in accordance with the underwriting guidelines of the Bank. These guidelines are generally consistent with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae guidelines for residential real estate loans.  With respect to commercial real estate loans, the Bank also reviews the capital adequacy of the business, the income potential of the property, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and honor its other obligations, and general economic and industry conditions.
Upon receipt of a loan application and all required related information from a prospective borrower, the loan application is submitted for approval or rejection. The residential mortgage loan underwriters approve loans which meet Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae underwriting requirements. The Chairman of the Company, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank, the President of the Bank, the Executive Vice President/Business Development, the Senior Vice President/Chief Lending Officer and Senior Vice President/Mortgage Lending individually have the authority to approve loans of $500,000 or less, except as set forth above for conforming conventionally underwritten, single family mortgage loans, which are approved by the underwriters.  Loans in excess of $500,000 and up to $1.0 million require the approval of any three of the following: Chairman of the Company, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank, the President of the Bank, the President of the Company, the Executive Vice President/Business Development, the Senior Vice President/Chief Lending Officer, the Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee or the Secretary of the Executive Committee.  Any loan in excess of $1.0 million must be approved by the Bank's Executive Committee, which operates as the Bank's Loan Committee.  The loan approval limits discussed above are the aggregate of all loans to any one borrower or entity, not including loans that are secured by the borrower's primary residence, and are conventionally underwritten.
The general policy of Security Federal is to issue loan commitments to qualified borrowers for a specified term, generally for a period of 45 days or less.  With management approval, commitments may be extended for up to an additional 45 days.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $991,000 in outstanding commitments on mortgage loans not yet closed compared to $1.3 million at December 31, 2017. Security Federal had outstanding commitments available on all lines of credit (including letters of credit, commercial, undisbursed loans in process, home equity, credit cards and other consumer loans) totaling $83.7 million at December 31, 2018.  See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report.
Residential Real Estate Lending.  At December 31, 2018 the Bank had $85.7 million or 19.2% of the Bank's total outstanding loan portfolio in residential real estate loans. These loans can have adjustable or fixed rates and include permanent one- to four-family residential mortgage loans as well as construction loans for single family dwellings to owner-occupants. 
Security Federal offers a variety of ARMs which offer adjustable rates of interest, payments, loan balances or terms to maturity which vary according to specified indices.  The Bank's ARMs generally have a loan term of 15 to 30 years with initial rate adjustments every one, three, five or seven years during the term of the loan.  After the initial rate adjustment, the loan rate then adjusts annually.  Most of the Bank's ARMs contain a 200 basis point limit as to the maximum amount of change in the interest rate at any adjustment period and a 500 or 600 basis point limit over the life of the loan. The Bank generally originates ARMs to retain in its portfolio. These loans are generally made consistent with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae guidelines. When they do not, mitigating factors are present to make it a sound loan. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank originated $67.6 million in residential real estate loans, 36.5% of which had adjustable interest rates. At December 31, 2018, residential ARMs totaled $68.3 million or 15.3% of the Bank's loan portfolio. At December 31, 2018, the Bank also held approximately $17.5 million or 3.9% of the loan portfolio in longer term fixed rate residential mortgage loans.  Currently, the Bank sells the majority of its longer term fixed rate mortgage loans at origination.
There are unquantifiable risks resulting from possible increased costs to the borrower as a result of periodic repricing.  Despite the benefits of ARMs to the Bank's asset/liability management program, these loans also pose potential additional risks, primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying payment by the borrower rises, increasing the potential for default.  At the same time, marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates.
When making a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan, the Bank evaluates both the borrower's creditworthiness and his or her general ability to make principal and interest payments, and the value of the property that will secure the loan.  The Bank generally makes loans on one- to four-family residential properties in amounts of 95% or less of the appraised value of the collateral.  When loans are made for amounts which exceed 80% of the appraised value of the underlying real estate, the Bank's general policy is to require private mortgage insurance on the portion of the loan in excess of 80% of the appraised value.  In general, the Bank restricts its residential lending to South Carolina and the nearby Augusta, Georgia market.

Construction loans are generally made for periods of six months to one year with either adjustable or fixed rates.  At December 31, 2018, residential construction loans on one- to four-family dwellings to owner-occupants totaled $13.2 million, or 3.0%, of the Bank's loan portfolio. On loans of this type, the Bank seeks to evaluate the financial condition and prior performance of the builder, as well as the borrower's creditworthiness and his or her general ability to make principal and interest payments, and the value of the property that will secure the loan. On construction loans offered to individuals (non-builders), the Bank offers a construction/permanent loan.  The one year construction portion of the loan has a fixed rate ranging currently from 3.25% to 6.25% depending on which ARM program the borrower has chosen for the permanent portion of the loan after the construction period. The borrower pays interest on the loan during the construction phase.  After construction, the loan then automatically converts, depending on the borrower's upfront selection, to a one year ARM, a three year/one year ARM, or a five year/one year ARM loan in which the borrower will pay principal and interest.  The borrower also has the option, after the construction period only, to convert the loan to a fixed rate residential mortgage loan which the Bank immediately sells on the secondary market on a servicing released basis.
Commercial Real Estate, Commercial Business and Multi-Family Loans.  The commercial business loans originated by the Bank are primarily secured by business equipment, furniture and fixtures, inventory and receivables, or are unsecured. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $28.1 million, or 6.3% of its total loan portfolio, in commercial business loans.  A total of $762,000, or 2.7% of these loans were unsecured at December 31, 2018.
The commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank are primarily secured by non-residential commercial properties, churches, hotels, residential developments, single family speculative dwellings or pre-sold homes, land lots, income property developments, and undeveloped land.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $276.0 million, or 61.8% of its total loan portfolio, in commercial real estate loans and multi-family loans. Included in these loans at December 31, 2018 was $23.7 million in A&D loans with terms of typically two to three years. Also included in commercial real estate loans was $12.3 million in loans for the construction of single family dwellings to builders with a term of typically one year.
Multi-family loans originated by the Bank are primarily secured by commercial residential properties including apartment complexes, condominiums or townhouses, and loans for acquisition and development of, or improvements to multi-family residential properties. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $7.3 million, or 1.6% of its total loan portfolio, in multi-family loans.
The following table summarizes the Bank's commercial real estate, multi-family, and commercial business loans by geographic market area at December 31, 2018.

 | Aiken County, SC | | Midlands Area, SC | | Metro Augusta, GA | | Other | Total
 | (In Thousands) 
Commercial real estate | $ | 83,005 | | | $ | 82,374 | | $ | 65,163 | $ | 38,146 | $ | 268,688
Multi-family | 5,176 | | | 1,331 | | | 765 | | — | 7,272 | 
Commercial business | 11,616 | | | 6,779 | | | 4,947 | | 4,745 | 28,087 | 
Total | $ | 99,797 | | | $ | 90,484 | | $ | 70,875 | $ | 42,891 | $ | 304,047

Loans secured by commercial real estate are typically written for amortization terms of 10 to 20 years. Commercial loans not secured by real estate are typically based on terms of three to 60 months. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans not secured by real estate can be originated on adjustable or fixed rate terms.  Adjustable rates are tied to the prime rate as quoted in The Wall Street Journal and typically adjust on a daily basis. Since 2009, the Bank has instituted floors of typically 4% to 6% on newly originated adjustable rate commercial business and commercial real estate loans. If ceilings are used, the loan will typically require a balloon payment in 60 months or less. Fixed rate loans on commercial real estate usually require a balloon payment in 36 to 60 months. Fixed rate loans on non-real estate collateral are generally amortizing in five years or less.
Commercial real estate lending entails significant additional credit risk when compared to residential lending. Commercial real estate loans typically involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.  Because payments on loans secured by commercial properties often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.  In order to minimize the risks associated with this type of loan, the Bank generally limits the maximum loan-to-value ratio for commercial real estate to a range of 65% to 80%, based on appraisals of the property at the time of the loan by appraisers designated by the Bank, and strictly scrutinizes the credit history, financial condition and cash flow of the borrower, the quality of the collateral and the expertise of management of the property securing the loan.

Although the creditworthiness of the business and its principals is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. A&D loans secured by improved lots generally involve greater risks than residential mortgage lending because these loans are more difficult to evaluate. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, in the event of default and foreclosure, we may be confronted with a property, the value of which is insufficient to assure full payment.
Commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than residential mortgage lending and involves risks that are different from those associated with lending that is secured by real estate. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan-to-collateral values, and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Although commercial business loans often have equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets as collateral, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often not a sufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use, among other conditions. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is a secondary and often insufficient source of repayment. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks by strictly scrutinizing the borrower's current financial condition, ability to pay, past earnings and payment history.  In addition, the current financial condition and payment history of all principals are reviewed.  Typically, the Bank requires the principal or owners of a business to guarantee all loans made to their business by the Bank.  Although the creditworthiness of the business and its principals is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount.
Consumer Loans.  The Bank originates consumer loans for any personal, family or household purpose, including the financing of home improvements, loans to individuals for residential lots for a future home, automobiles, boats, mobile homes, recreational vehicles and education.  The Bank also makes consumer first and second mortgage loans secured by residences.  These loans typically do not qualify for sale in the secondary market, but are generally not considered sub-prime lending by the Bank's regulators. In addition, the Bank offers home equity lines of credit.  Home equity loans are secured by mortgage liens on the borrower's principal or second residence. Home equity lines are open end lines of credit where the borrowers pay a minimum of interest only monthly on drawn lines.  The terms are for a maximum period of 20 years and the rate is a variable rate tied to prime and floats monthly.  Margins range from none to 2.5%. 
In 2012, the Bank instituted interest rate floors, which currently range from 3.25% to 4.25%, on new originations and a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% if the first mortgage was originated by Security Federal and 70% if the first mortgage was originated by another lender. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $27.7 million of home equity lines of credit outstanding and $26.0 million of additional commitments of home equity lines of credit.  The Bank also makes secured and unsecured lines of credit available.  Although consumer loans involve a higher level of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, they generally provide higher yields and have shorter terms to maturity than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $56.9 million, or 12.7% of its loan portfolio, in consumer loans. 

The Bank's underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan.  The stability of the applicant's monthly income is determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and from any verifiable secondary income.  Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount.
The Bank also has a credit card program.  As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had issued 3,712 Mastercard credit cards with total approved credit lines of $8.4 million, of which $2.6 million was outstanding on that date.
Loan Delinquencies and Defaults
General.  The Bank's collection procedures provide that when a real estate loan is approximately 20 days past due, the borrower is contacted by mail and payment is requested.  If the delinquency continues for another 10 days, subsequent efforts are made to contact the delinquent borrower and establish a program to bring the loan current.  In certain instances, the Bank may modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize his financial affairs.  If the loan continues in a delinquent status for 60 days or more, the Bank generally initiates foreclosure proceedings after the customer has been notified by certified mail.  The Bank institutes the same collection procedure for its commercial real estate loans.

Classified Assets.  Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality as "substandard," "doubtful" or "loss" assets.  The regulations require commercial banks to classify their own assets and to establish prudent general allowances for loan losses for assets classified "substandard" or "doubtful."  For the portion of assets classified as "loss," an institution is required to either establish specific allowances of 100% of the amount classified or charge off such amount.  In addition, the State Board and/or FDIC may require the establishment of a general allowance for losses based on assets classified as "substandard" and "doubtful" or based on the general quality of the asset portfolio of a Bank.  See "Regulation - Regulation of the Bank." 
The Company uses a risk based approach based on the following credit quality measures consistent with regulatory guidelines when analyzing the loan portfolio: pass, caution, special mention, and substandard. These indicators are used to rate the credit quality of loans for the purposes of determining the Company’s allowance for loan losses. Pass loans are loans that are performing and are deemed adequately protected by the net worth of the borrower or the underlying collateral value. These loans are considered to have the least amount of risk in terms of determining the allowance for loan losses. Loans that are graded as substandard are considered to have the most risk. These loans typically have an identified weakness or weaknesses and are inadequately protected by the net worth of the borrower or collateral value. All loans 90 days or more past due are automatically classified in this category. The caution and special mention categories fall in between the pass and substandard grades and consist of loans that do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification but possess weaknesses. 
At December 31, 2018, $14.6 million of the total loan balance were classified "substandard" compared to $11.7 million at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, $20.4 million were designated as "special mention" compared to $23.8 million at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, $60.6 million were designated as “caution” compared to $60.1 million at December 31, 2017. The Bank had no loans classified as "doubtful" or "loss" at December 31, 2018 and 2017. According to generally accepted accounting principles, the Bank is required to account for certain loan modifications or restructuring as a “troubled debt restructuring” ("TDRs"). In general, the modification or restructuring of a debt is considered a TDR if the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that would not otherwise be considered. As of December 31, 2018, there were $1.4 million in TDRs compared to $4.1 million at December 31, 2017.  The Bank's classification of assets is consistent with FDIC regulatory classifications.
Non-performing Assets.  Loans are placed on non-accrual status when the collection of principal and/or interest becomes doubtful.  In addition, all loans are placed on non-accrual status when the loan becomes 90 days or more contractually delinquent.  All consumer loans more than 90 days delinquent are charged against the consumer loan allowance for loan losses unless there is adequate collateral which is in the process of being repossessed or foreclosed on.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $1.4 million in TDRs which involved restructuring the borrower's interest rate or principal on a loan or making other concessions on loans at a rate materially less than the market rate.  Other loans of concern are those loans (not delinquent more than 60 days) that management has determined need to be closely monitored as the potential exists for increased risk on these loans in the future.  Non-performing loans are reviewed monthly on a loan by loan basis.  Charge-offs, whether partial or in full, associated with these loans will vary based on estimates of recovery for each loan.

__________
(1) Includes three loans with a combined balance of $419,000 at December 31, 2018 that are also included in the Non-Accruing Loans section of this table. 
Non-performing loans increased $1.3 million or 23.3% to $7.0 million at December 31, 2018 from $5.7 million at December 31, 2017. The largest increase in non-performing loans was in the consumer loans category, which increased $956,000 or 299.7% to $1.3 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $319,000 at December 31, 2017. Non-performing consumer loans at December 31, 2018 consisted of 12 loans to 12 borrowers with an average loan balance of $106,000, the largest of which was a home equity line of credit with a balance of $843,000. 
Non-performing commercial real estate loans increased $224,000 or 6.7% to $3.6 million at December 31, 2018 from $3.3 million at December 31, 2017. The balance in non-performing commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2018 consisted of 18 loans to 15 borrowers with an average loan balance of $198,000 compared to 24 loans to 20 borrowers with an average loan balance of $139,000 at December 31, 2017. Of the non-performing commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2018, $3.3 million consisted of 14 loans secured by commercial buildings or first mortgages on principal residences throughout the Bank's market area to 12 different borrowers. Loans secured by principal residences are considered commercial real estate if they were business purpose loans. The remaining non-performing commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2018 consisted of $18,000 for one acquisition and development loan and $235,000 for three loans secured by raw land to three separate borrowers. At December 31, 2018, our largest non-performing commercial real estate loan had a balance of $1.4 million and is secured by a commercial building.
Non-performing loans within the residential real estate loan category increased $136,000 or 7.0% to $2.1 million at December 31, 2018 from $1.9 million at December 31, 2017. Non-performing residential real estate loans at December 31, 2018 consisted of 14 loans to 14 borrowers with an average loan balance of $149,000, the largest of which was $374,000. At December 31, 2017, non-performing residential real estate loans consisted of 17 loans to 17 borrowers with an average loan balance of $146,000, the largest of which was $352,000. 

At December 31, 2018, there were no accruing loans equal to or more than 90 days delinquent. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the interest income not recognized that would have been recognized with respect to non-accruing loans, had such loans been current in accordance with their original terms and with respect to TDRs, had such loans been current in accordance with their original terms, totaled $760,000 compared to $830,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.  For the year ended 
11

December 31, 2018 actual interest recorded on these loans was $329,000 compared to $214,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Troubled Debt Restructurings. The Bank identifies and reviews all loans to be restructured based on an assessment of the borrower's credit status. This assessment is a continuous process that involves a review of the financial statements and prospects for repayment, payment delinquency, non-accrual status, and risk rating.
Not all loan modifications are TDRs. The Bank designates a loan modification as a TDR when the following two conditions are present: the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and because of this difficulty, the Bank grants a concession it would not otherwise consider. Typically these concessions involve a change in the interest rate, maturity date or payment amount or some combination of each. These concessions rarely result in the forgiveness of principal or interest. TDRs are considered impaired and are initially reported as non-performing loans on non-accrual status. Non-performing TDRs may be returned to accrual status when payment in full of all amounts due under the restructured terms is anticipated and the borrower has demonstrated a sustained payment history which is typically six months.
The Bank did not modify any loans that were considered to be TDRs during the year ended December 31, 2018. The Bank had seven loans totaling $1.4 million at December 31, 2018 which were TDRs modified in prior years, compared to eight TDRs totaling $4.1 million at December 31, 2017. The seven TDRs consisted of one unsecured consumer loan with a balance of $12,000 and six commercial real estate loans to five separate borrowers, the largest of which had a balance of $482,000 at December 31, 2018. The commercial real estate loans were secured primarily by first mortgages on one single family residence, two lots, one commercial building and three churches.
 At December 31, 2018, one TDR, restructured during a previous year, with a balance of $374,000 was in default. All remaining TDRs were current at December 31, 2018. The Bank considers any loan 30 days or more past due to be in default.
Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans include substandard loans that are not already included as non-accrual loans or TDRs and special mention loans where management has become aware of information regarding possible borrower credit issues that could potentially cause doubt about their ability to comply with current repayment terms. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank had identified $27.9 million and $29.7 million, respectively, of potential problem loans through its internal loan review procedures. 
Repossessed Assets.  OREO had a balance of $722,000 at December 31, 2018 and consisted of the following real estate properties: three single-family residences, 14 acres of residential land, and three parcels of commercial land located throughout our market areas in South Carolina. 

Provision for Losses on Loans.  Security Federal recognizes that it will experience credit losses during the course of making loans and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other things, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the underlying security for the loan.  The Bank seeks to establish and maintain sufficient reserves for estimated losses on specifically identified loans and real estate where such losses can be estimated.  Additionally, general reserves for estimated possible losses are established on specified portions of the Bank's portfolio such as consumer loans and higher risk residential construction mortgage loans based on management's estimate of the potential loss for loans which normally can be classified as higher risk.  Specific and general reserves are based on, among other criteria: (1) the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, (2) current economic conditions on a local as well as a statewide basis, (3) actual losses experienced historically and (4) the level of reserves for possible losses in the future.  
At December 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses or reserve was $9.2 million.  In determining the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses, management reviews past experience of loan charge-offs, the level of past due and non-accrual loans, the size and mix of the portfolio, general economic conditions in the market area, and individual loans to identify potential credit problems.  Commercial business, commercial real estate and consumer loans were $361.0 million, or 80.8% of the total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2018.  Although these types of loans carry a higher level of credit risk than conventional residential mortgage loans, the level of reserves reflects management's continuing evaluation of this risk based on the Bank's past loss experience.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank's ratio of loans delinquent more than 60 days to total assets was 0.48%. The reserve is management's best estimate for offsetting risk for our estimated possible losses. There can be no guarantee that the estimate is adequate or accurate.  
12

Management believes that reserves for loan losses are at a level adequate to provide for inherent loan losses.  Although management believes that it has considered all relevant factors in its estimation of future losses, future adjustments to reserves may be necessary if conditions change substantially from the assumptions used in making the original estimations.  Regulators will from time to time evaluate the allowance for loan losses which is subject to adjustment based upon the information available to the regulators at the time of their examinations.
The following table sets forth an analysis of the Bank's allowance for loan losses during the dates indicated.

Investment Activities
Investment securities.

__________
(1)      Does not include mortgage-backed securities.
At December 31, 2018, the Company did not have any investment securities (exclusive of obligations of the U.S. Government and federal agencies) issued by any one entity with a total book value in excess of 10% of its shareholders' equity. SBA bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and carry a zero percent risk base when calculating risk based assets for regulatory capital purposes. Student Loan Pools are typically 97% guaranteed by the U.S. government. The FHLB, FFCB, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government sponsored enterprises ("GSEs") and the securities and bonds issued by GSEs are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

The following table sets forth the maturities or repricing of investment securities, not including mortgage-backed securities, and FHLB stock at December 31, 2018, and the weighted average yields of such securities and FHLB stock (calculated on the basis of the cost and effective yields weighted for the scheduled maturity of each security).  Tax equivalent yields on tax exempt municipal bonds are calculated using a 21% tax rate.  Callable securities are shown at their likely call dates based on current interest rates.  The table was prepared using amortized cost.  SBA bonds are based on maturity dates without the effect of scheduled payments or anticipated prepayments.

Mortgage-backed Securities.  Security Federal has a portfolio of available for sale and held to maturity mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage-backed securities can serve as collateral for borrowings and, through repayments, as a source of liquidity.  Under the Bank's risk-based capital requirement, mortgage-backed securities have a risk weight of 20% (or 0% in the case of Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae") securities) compared to the 50% risk weight carried by residential loans.

Sources of Funds
Deposit accounts have traditionally been a principal source of the Bank's funds for use in lending and for other general business purposes.  In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from loan repayments, cash flows generated from operations (including interest credited to deposit accounts), FHLB of Atlanta advances, borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, sales of investment securities, sales of securities under agreements to repurchase, and loan sales.  See "Borrowings" below and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report.  Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds while deposit inflows and outflows and the related cost of such funds have varied widely.  FHLB of Atlanta advances, borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank and the sale of securities under agreements to repurchase may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for seasonal reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels and may be used on a longer term basis in support of expanded lending activities.  The availability of funds from loan and investment sales is influenced by general interest rates.  See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained in the Annual Report.

Deposits.  The Bank attracts both short-term and long-term deposits from the general public by offering a wide assortment of account types and rates. The Bank offers regular savings accounts, checking accounts, various money market accounts, fixed interest rate certificates with varying maturities, negotiated rate $100,000 or above jumbo certificates of deposit ("Jumbo CDs") and individual retirement accounts.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $33.1 million in brokered deposits.   The Bank believes that, based on its experience over the past several years, its savings and transaction accounts are stable sources of deposits.

Borrowings
As a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta and is authorized to apply for advances from the FHLB of Atlanta.  Each FHLB credit program has its own interest rate, which may be fixed or variable, and range of maturities.  The FHLB of Atlanta may prescribe the acceptable uses to which these advances may be utilized as well as limitations on the size of the advances and repayment provisions.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $34.0 million in outstanding advances from the FHLB of Atlanta.  See Note 10 of  the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report for information regarding the maturities and rate structure of the Bank's FHLB advances.  Federal law contains certain collateral requirements for FHLB advances.  See "Regulation - Regulation of the Bank - Federal Home Loan Bank System."
At December 31, 2018, the Company had $5.2 million in junior subordinated debentures.  The debentures accrue and pay distributions quarterly at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 170 points which was equal to 4.49% at December 31, 2018.  The debentures were callable by the Company in September 2011, and quarterly thereafter, with a final maturity date of December 15, 2036.  See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report for more information.

On October 31, 2016, the Company repurchased all 22,000 shares of its Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (“Series B Preferred Stock”) from the United States Department of the Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”) for $21.3 million plus accrued but unpaid interest of $93,000 for a total payment of $21.4 million. In connection with this repurchase, the Company obtained a $14.0 million unsecured term loan from another financial institution. The loan will mature on October 1, 2019 and accrues and pays interest quarterly at a floating rate of the Wall Street Journal Prime index minus 30 basis points, which was equal to 4.95% at December 31, 2018. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report for more information.

Competition
The Bank serves the counties of Aiken, Lexington, Richland and Saluda, South Carolina, and Columbia County, Georgia through its 16 full service branch offices located in Aiken, Ballentine, Clearwater, Columbia, Graniteville, Langley, Lexington, North Augusta, Ridge Spring, Wagener, and West Columbia, South Carolina, and Evans, Georgia.
Security Federal faces strong competition both in originating loans and in attracting deposits.  Competition in originating loans comes primarily from other commercial banks, federal savings institutions, mortgage bankers and credit unions who also make loans in the Bank's market area, and more recently, financial technology (or “FinTech”) companies. 
The Bank competes for loans principally on the basis of the interest rates and loan fees it charges, the types of loans it makes and the quality of services it provides to borrowers.
The Bank faces substantial competition in attracting deposits from federal savings institutions, commercial banks, money market and mutual funds, credit unions and other investment vehicles.  The ability of the Bank to attract and retain deposits depends on its ability to provide an investment opportunity that satisfies the requirements of investors as to rate of return, liquidity, risk and other factors.  The Bank attracts a significant amount of deposits through its branch offices primarily from the communities in which those branch offices are located.  Therefore, competition for those deposits is principally from federal savings institutions, credit unions and commercial banks located in the same communities. FinTech companies also compete for consumer deposit relationships. The Bank competes for these deposits by offering a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours, online/mobile services, and convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges at each.

REGULATION
The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations which are applicable to the Company and the Bank. Descriptions of laws and regulations here and elsewhere in this Form 10-K do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress or in the South Carolina State Legislature that may affect the operations of the Company and the Bank. In addition, the regulations governing the Company and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the State Board, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the SEC and the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau (“CFPB”). Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. We cannot predict whether any such changes may occur.
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve. The Company also is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. The Bank, as a state-chartered commercial bank, is subject to regulation and oversight by the State Board, the applicable provisions of South Carolina law and by the regulations of the State Board adopted thereunder.  The Bank also is subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures its deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law.
The laws and regulations affecting depository institutions and their holding companies have changed significantly particularly in connection with the enactment of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”). Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements under these laws. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a smaller financial institution, the Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and the State Board with respect to our compliance with federal and state consumer financial protection laws and regulations.
2018 Regulatory Reform
In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory changes for community banks such as Sound Community Bank, and their holding companies.
The Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single Community Bank Leverage Ratio of between 8 and 10 percent. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds that ratio will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules.
The Act also expands the category of holding companies that may rely on the Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement of the Federal Reserve by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion. A major effect of this change is to exclude such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Act will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the Act and the yet-to-be-written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks. 
Regulation of the Bank
The Bank is an FDIC-insured, state-chartered commercial bank and is subject to various statutory requirements and rules and regulations promulgated and enforced primarily by the FDIC and the State Board. These statutes, rules, and regulations relate to insurance of deposits, required reserves, allowable investments, loans, mergers, consolidations, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches and other aspects of the business of the Bank. The FDIC has broad authority to prohibit the Bank from engaging in what it determines to be unsafe or unsound banking practices. In addition, federal law imposes a number of restrictions on state-chartered, FDIC-insured banks, and their subsidiaries. These restrictions cover many matters, examples of 
23

which include prohibitions against engaging as a principal in certain activities and the requirement of prior notification of branch closings. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System.
The Bank is required to file periodic reports with the FDIC and the State Board and is subject to periodic examinations and evaluations by those regulatory authorities. Based on these evaluations, the regulators may revalue the assets of an institution and require that it establish specific reserves to compensate for the differences between the determined value and the book value of these assets. The FDIC and the State Board may each accept the results of an examination by the other in lieu of conducting an independent examination.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") of the FDIC insures deposits in the Bank up to $250,000 per separately insured deposit ownership right or category and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums (assessments) and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank paid $278,000 in FDIC premiums. The assessment base for these premiums is the Bank’s total average consolidated assets less average tangible capital.
Under the FDIC's regulations, the assessment base for a bank is equal to its total average consolidated assets less average tangible equity capital. Currently, the FDIC’s base assessment rates are 3 to 30 basis points and are subject to certain adjustments. For institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, rates are determined based on supervisory ratings and certain financial ratios. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment.
In addition, federally insured institutions are required to pay a Financing Corporation ("FICO") assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980's. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the FICO assessment rate was 0.32 basis points (annualized) of the assessment base, computed on assets. These assessments will continue until the remaining bonds have matured in September 2019. For 2018, the Bank incurred approximately $24,000 in these assessments.
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC.  It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital.  If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC.  Management is not aware of any existing circumstances which would result in termination of the Bank's deposit insurance.
A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank.  There can be no prediction as to what changes in insurance assessment rates may be made in the future.

Prompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution's category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures, which include risk-based capital measures, a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") measure, a leverage ratio measure and certain other factors. The well-capitalized category is described below in "Capital Requirements". An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits, generally. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. 
Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions that become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by institutions to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if unremedied, result in progressively more severe restrictions on their activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for review by the banking agencies may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank was categorized as "well capitalized" under the prompt corrective action regulations of the FDIC. For additional information, see "Capital Requirements" below and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. 

24

Capital Requirements. Effective January 1, 2015 (with certain provisions phased in over several years), the Bank became subject to new capital adequacy requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, which created a new required ratio for CET1 capital, increased the minimum leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, changed the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, created an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios, and changed what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the Dodd Frank Act and the “Basel III” requirements. 
Under the capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0%.  CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) unless an institution elects to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
In addition to the minimum capital requirements, the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer, which consists of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, increasing each year until fully phased in on January 1, 2019. 
To be considered well capitalized, a depository institution must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.5% and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0% and not be subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which its primary federal banking regulator requires it to maintain a specific capital level.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank met the requirements to be "well capitalized" and met the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement. Management monitors the capital levels of the Bank to provide for current and future business opportunities and to meet regulatory guidelines for “well capitalized” institutions. 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard for US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles that will be effective for us for our first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is generally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital. The federal banking regulators (the Federal Reserve and the FDIC) have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital.
The FDIC has the authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution's capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances. Management of the Bank believes that, under the current regulations, the Bank will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future. For a complete description of the Bank's required and actual capital levels on December 31, 2018, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report.

Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of financial institutions. The FHLBs are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The FHLBs are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System and make loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Board. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $34.0 million of outstanding advances from the FHLB of Atlanta under an available credit facility of $270.6 million, which is limited to available collateral. See "Business - Sources of Funds - Borrowings."
25

As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Atlanta. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $2.2 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. In past years, the Bank has received substantial dividends on its FHLB stock. These dividend yields have averaged 6.16% for the year ended December 31, 2018; 4.96% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 4.70% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have in the past affected adversely the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB of Atlanta stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank's FHLB of Atlanta stock may result in a decrease in net income and possibly the Bank's capital.
Affiliate Transactions. The Company and the Bank are separate and distinct legal entities. Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. Transactions deemed to be a "covered transaction" under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and between a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company are limited to 10% of the bank subsidiary's capital and surplus and, with respect to the parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank subsidiary's capital and surplus. Further, covered transactions that are loans and extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Federal law also requires that covered transactions and certain other transactions listed in Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act between a bank and its affiliates be on terms as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates.
Community Reinvestment Act. The Bank is also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 ("CRA"), which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank’s performance under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the Bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency's assessment of a bank's record is made available to the public. Further, a bank’s CRA performance rating must be considered in connection with a bank’s application to, among other things, establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution, and in connection with certain applications by a bank holding company, such as bank acquisitions. The Bank received an "outstanding" rating during its most recent examination. 

Dividends. Dividends from the Bank constitute the major source of funds for dividends which may be paid by the Company to shareholders. The amount of dividends payable by the Bank to the Company depends upon the Bank's earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies, including the capital conservation buffer requirement discussed above. South Carolina banking regulations restrict the amount of dividends that the Bank can pay to the Company, and may require prior approval before declaration and payment of any excess dividend.
The amount of dividends actually paid during any one period will be strongly affected by the Bank's management policy of maintaining a strong capital position. Federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may pay a cash dividend if it would cause the institution to be "undercapitalized," as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice.
Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions. Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank's total assets, (iii) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors', trustees' and officers' liability insurance coverage or bankers' blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, (iv) acting as agent for a customer in many capacities, and (v) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met.
Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or non-interest-bearing deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. Negotiable order of withdrawal ("NOW") accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to the reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a savings bank. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank's deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and vault cash exceeded its reserve requirements.
26

Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; loan documentation; credit underwriting; interest rate risk exposure; asset growth; asset quality; earnings; and compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution’s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer, and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. Each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems. If the FDIC determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines, it may require an institution to submit to the FDIC an acceptable plan to achieve compliance.
Environmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), a federal statute, generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present "owners and operators" of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term "owner and operator" excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this "secured creditor exemption" has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property. 
Privacy Standards. The Bank is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of its information sharing practices and informing consumers of their rights to opt out of certain practices.
Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their clients. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions.
Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and empowered it to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less than $10 billion, the Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and the State Board with respect to our compliance with federal and state consumer financial protection laws and regulations.
The Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights.

Regulation of the Company
General. The Company, as the sole shareholder of the Bank, is a registered bank holding company with the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHCA"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. This regulation and oversight is generally intended to ensure that the Company limits its activities to those allowed by law and that it operates in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of the Bank. 
As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve semi-annual and periodic reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require and is subject to regular examinations by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may examine the Company, and any of its subsidiaries, and charge the Company for the cost of the examination. The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 
The Bank Holding Company Act. Under the BHCA, the Company is supervised by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act and earlier Federal Reserve policy provide that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank by having the ability to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary bank during periods of financial distress to the bank, and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary bank. A bank holding company's failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve's regulations or both. No regulations have yet been proposed by the Federal Reserve to implement the source of strength provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Company and any subsidiaries that it may control are considered "affiliates" within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between the Bank and affiliates (except subsidiaries of the Bank) are subject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries, are prohibited from tying the provision of various services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by the Company, or by its affiliates.
Acquisitions. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve is authorized to approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company, the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The list of activities determined by regulation to be closely related to banking within the meaning of the BHCA includes, among other things: operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers' checks and U.S. Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers.
Capital Requirements. As discussed above, pursuant to the Act, effective August 30, 2018, bank holding companies with less than $3.0 billion in consolidated assets are generally no longer subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital regulations, which are essentially the same as the capital regulations applicable to the Bank described under the caption “Capital Requirements” above. If the Company were subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with $3.0 billion or more in assets at December 31, 2018, the Company would have exceeded all regulatory requirements. The Federal Reserve expects a holding company's subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. For additional information, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report.
 Interstate Banking. The Federal Reserve may approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than such holding company's home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state except with respect to the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period, not exceeding five years, specified by the law of the host state. The Federal Reserve may not approve an application if the applicant controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United States or 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank's home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch. Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state that may be 
28

held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30% state-wide concentration limit contained in the federal law.
The federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the banks adopted a law prior to June 1, 1997 which applies equally to all out-of-state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out-of-state banks. Interstate acquisitions of branches will be permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above. De novo interstate branching banks are generally permissible, subject to application requirements. 
Dividends. As a South Carolina corporation, the Company is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends under South Carolina law. In addition, the Company is an entity separate and distinct from its principal subsidiary, Security Federal Bank, and derives substantially all of its revenue in the form of dividends from this subsidiary. Accordingly, the Company is, and will be, dependent upon dividends from the Bank to pay the principal of and interest on its indebtedness, to satisfy its other cash needs and to pay dividends on its common stock. The Company is also subject to certain federal regulatory considerations. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve's view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company's net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition, and that it is inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Dividends are also subject to restriction if the capital conservation buffer requirement is not met. 

Stock Repurchases. Bank holding companies, except for certain "well-capitalized" and highly rated bank holding companies, are required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of their consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve.
Federal Securities Laws. The Company’s common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  We are subject to information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act.
The Dodd-Frank Act. Among other requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, like the Company, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a “say on pay” vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. For certain of these changes, the implementing regulations have not been promulgated, so the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on public companies cannot be determined at this time.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  As a public company that files periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act, the Company is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. Our policies and procedures have been updated to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Jumpstart Our Business Startups ("JOBS") Act. The JOBS Act was signed into law on April 5, 2012 and allows banks and bank holding companies to terminate the registration of a class of securities under Section 12(g) and Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act if such class is held of record by less than 1,200 persons, an increase from the prior 300 person threshold. The SEC issued proposed rules on August 29, 2012 and on December 18, 2014 and has also mandated rules under Title III of the JOBS Act. The Company's Board continues to evaluate the costs and advantages and disadvantages of being an SEC registered company and the effects of deregistering its shares of common stock, including among other things, the resulting decrease in the liquidity of its shares.

TAXATION
Federal Taxation
General.  The Company and the Bank report their income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly the Bank's reserve for bad debts discussed below.  The following discussion of tax matters is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Bank or the Company.
Distributions.  To the extent that the Bank makes "nondividend distributions" to the Company, these distributions will be considered to result in distributions from the balance of its bad debt reserve as of December 31, 1987 (or a lesser amount if the Bank's loan portfolio decreased since December 31, 1987) and then from the supplemental reserve for losses on loans ("Excess Distributions"), and an amount based on the Excess Distributions will be included in the Bank's taxable income.  Nondividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank's current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation.  However, dividends paid out of the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, will not be considered to result in a distribution from the Bank's bad debt reserve.  The amount of additional taxable income created from an Excess Distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution.  Thus, if the Bank makes a "nondividend distribution," then approximately one and one-half times the Excess Distribution would be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 21% corporate income tax rate (exclusive of state and local taxes).  See "Regulation - Regulation of the Bank - Dividends” for limits on the payment of dividends by the Bank.  The Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its tax bad debt reserve.
Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) effective January 1, 2018, repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT), allowing corporations to fully apply any unused AMT credit. At December 31, 2017, the Company had no AMT credit carryforward to apply against the 2018 tax liability.
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Under the Tax Act, a financial institution may carryforward net operating losses indefinitely. As of December 31, 2018, management determined it is more likely than not that the total deferred tax asset will be realized except for the deferred tax asset associated with state net operating loss carryforwards, and, accordingly, has established a valuation allowance only for this item. The change in the valuation allowance was $21,000. 
Dividends-Received Deduction.  The Company may exclude from its income dividends received from the Bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that files a consolidated return with the Bank. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 100%, or 80%, in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, depending on the level of stock ownership of the payer of the dividend. Corporations that own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct 70% of dividends received or accrued on their behalf. 
Audits.  The Company, the Bank and its consolidated subsidiaries have been audited or their books closed without audit by the IRS with respect to consolidated federal income tax returns through March 31, 2013.  See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report for additional information regarding income taxes.
State Taxation
South Carolina has adopted the Internal Revenue Code as it relates to commercial banks, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.  The Bank is subject to South Carolina income tax at the rate of 4.5%.  The Bank has not been audited by the State of South Carolina during the past five years. The Company's income tax returns have not been audited by federal or state authorities within the last five years.  For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report.
