 ITEM 1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
  
  BACKGROUND AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE
  
  Know Labs, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 1998. Since 2007, we have been focused primarily on research and development of proprietary technologies which can be used to authenticate and diagnose a wide variety of organic and non-organic substances and materials. Our Common Stock trades on the OTCQB Exchange under the symbol “KNWN.”
 BUSINESS
  
  We are focused on the development, marketing and sales of proprietary technologies which are capable of uniquely identifying or authenticating almost any substance or material using electromagnetic energy to record, detect, and identify the unique “signature” of the substance or material. We call these our “Bio-RFID™” and “ChromaID™” technologies.
  
  Historically, the Company focused on the development of our proprietary ChromaID technology. Using light from low-cost LEDs (light emitting diodes) the ChromaID technology maps the color of substances, fluids and materials. With our proprietary processes we can authenticate and identify based upon the color that is present. The color is both visible to us as humans but also outside of the humanly visible color spectrum in the near infra-red and near ultra-violet and beyond. The Company’s ChromaID scanner sees what we like to call “Nature’s Color Fingerprint.” Everything in nature has a unique color identifier and with ChromaID the Company can see, and identify, and authenticate based upon the color that is present. The Company’s ChromaID scanner is capable of uniquely identifying and authenticating almost any substance or liquid using light to record, detect and identify its unique color signature. More recently, the Company has focused upon extensions and new inventions that are derived from and extend beyond our ChromaID technology. The Company calls this new technology “Bio-RFID.” The rapid advances made with our Bio-RFID technology in our laboratory have caused us to move quickly into the commercialization phase of our Company as we work to create revenue generating products for the marketplace. Today, the sole focus of the Company is on its Bio-RFID technology and its commercialization.
  
  In 2010, we acquired TransTech Systems, Inc. as an adjunct to our business. TransTech is a distributor of products for employee and personnel identification and authentication. TransTech has historically provided substantially all of the Company’s revenues. The financial results from our TransTech subsidiary have been diminishing as vendors of their products increasingly move to the Internet and direct sales to their customers. While it does provide our current revenues, it is not central to our current focus as a Company. Moreover, we have written down any goodwill associated with its historic acquisition. We continue to closely monitor this subsidiary and expect it to wind down completely in the near future.
  
  The Know Labs Technology
  
  We have internally and under contract with third parties developed proprietary platform technologies to uniquely identify or authenticate almost any material and substance. Our technology utilizes electromagnetic energy along the electromagnetic spectrum to perform analytics which allow the user to identify and authenticate substances and materials depending upon the user’s unique application and field of use. The Company’s proprietary platform technologies are called Bio-RFID and ChromaID.

  The Company’s latest technology platform is called Bio-RFID. Working in our lab over the last two years, we have developed extensions and new inventions derived in part from our ChromaID technology which we refer to as Bio-RFID technology. We are rapidly advancing the development of this technology. We have announced over the past year that we have successfully been able to non-invasively ascertain blood glucose levels in humans. We are building the internal and external development team necessary to commercialize this newly discovered technology as well as make additional patent filings covering the intellectual property created with these new inventions. The first applications of our Bio-RFID technology will be in a product we call the UBAND™. The first UBAND product will be marketed as a Continuous Glucose Monitor. It is a wearable product which will be worn on the wrist or ankle and communicate with a smart phone device via Bluetooth connectivity. It will provide the user with real time information on their blood glucose levels. This initial product will require US Food and Drug Administration approval prior to its introduction to the market.
  
  We have also announced the results of laboratory-based comparison testing between our Bio-RFID technology and the leading continuous glucose monitors from Abbott Labs (Freestyle Libre®) and DexCom (G5®). These results provide evidence of a high degree of correlation between our Bio-RFID based technology and the current industry leaders and their continuous glucose monitors. Our technology is fundamentally differentiated from these industry leaders as our UBAND continuous glucose monitor is completely non-invasive.
  
  We expect to begin the process of obtaining US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of our non-invasive continuous blood glucose monitoring device during calendar year 2020. To guide us in that undertaking we previously announced the hiring of a Chief Medical Officer and formed a Medical and Regulatory Advisory Board to guide us through the FDA process. We are unable, however, to estimate the time necessary for such approval nor the likelihood of success in that endeavor.
  
  Our ChromaID patented technology utilizes light at the photon (elementary particle of light) level through a series of emitters and detectors to generate a unique signature or “fingerprint” from a scan of almost any solid, liquid or gaseous material. This signature of reflected or transmitted light is digitized, creating a unique ChromaID signature. Each ChromaID signature is comprised of from hundreds to thousands of specific data points.
  
  The ChromaID technology looks beyond visible light frequencies to areas of near infra-red and ultraviolet light and beyond that are outside the humanly visible light spectrum. The data obtained allows us to create a very specific and unique ChromaID signature of the substance for a myriad of authentication, verification and identification applications.
  
  Traditional light-based identification technology, called spectrophotometry, has relied upon a complex system of prisms, mirrors and visible light. Spectrophotometers typically have a higher cost and utilize a form factor (shape and size) more suited to a laboratory setting and require trained laboratory personnel to interpret the information. The ChromaID technology uses lower cost LEDs and photodiodes and specific electromagnetic frequencies resulting in a more accurate, portable and easy-to-use solution for a wide variety of applications. The ChromaID technology not only has significant cost advantages as compared to spectrophotometry, it is also completely flexible is size, shape and configuration. The ChromaID scan head can range in size from endoscopic to a scale that could be the size of a large ceiling-mounted florescent light fixture.
  
  In normal operation, a ChromaID master or reference scan is generated and stored in a database. We call this the ChromaID Reference Data Library. The scan head can then scan similar materials to identify, authenticate or diagnose them by comparing the new ChromaID digital signature scan to that of the original or reference ChromaID signature or scan result. Over time, we believe the ChromaID Reference Libraries can become a significant asset of the Company, providing valuable information in numerous fields of use. The Reference Data Libraries for our newly developed Bio-RFID will have a similar promise regarding their utility and value.
  
  Bio-RFID and ChromaID: Foundational Platform Technologies
  
  Our Bio-RFID and ChromaID technologies provide a platform upon which a myriad of applications can be developed. As platform technologies, they are analogous to a smartphone, upon which an enormous number of previously unforeseen applications have been developed. Bio-RFID and ChromaID technologies are “enabling” technologies that bring the science of electromagnetic energy to low-cost, real-world commercialization opportunities across multiple industries. The technologies are foundational and, as such, the basis upon which the Company believes significant businesses can be built.
  
  As with other foundational technologies, a single application may reach across multiple industries. The Bio-RFID technology can non-invasively identity the presence and quantity of glucose in the human body. By extension, there may be other molecular structures which this same technology can identity in the human body which, over time, the Company will focus upon. They may include the monitoring of drug usage or the presence of illicit drugs. They may also involve identifying hormones and various markers of disease.

  Similarly, the ChromaID technology can, for example effectively differentiate and identify different brands of clear vodkas that appear identical to the human eye. By extension, this same technology could identify pure water from water with contaminants present. It could provide real time detection of liquid medicines such as morphine that have been adulterated or compromised. It could detect if jet fuel has water contamination present. It could determine when it is time to change oil in a deep fat fryer. These are but a few of the potential applications of the ChromaID technology based upon extensions of its ability to identify different liquids.
  
  The cornerstone of a company with a foundational platform technology is its intellectual property. We have pursued an active intellectual property strategy and have been granted 13 patents. We currently have a number of patents pending and continue, on a regular basis the filing of new patents. We possess all right, title and interest to the issued patents. Nine issued and pending patents are licensed exclusively to us in perpetuity by our strategic partner, Allied Inventors, a spin-off entity of Intellectual Ventures, an intellectual property fund.
