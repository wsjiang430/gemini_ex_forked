Item 1. Business
General
The Company is a Maryland corporation that was incorporated in April 2010. The Company's common stock is traded on the Global Select tier of the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol "CFFN." 
The Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is a federally chartered and insured savings bank headquartered in Topeka, Kansas. The Bank is examined and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"), its primary regulator, and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF"), which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). The Company, as a savings and loan holding company, is examined and regulated by the FRB.
In August 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of CCB and its wholly-owned subsidiary Capital City Bank, a commercial bank with $450 million in assets that was headquartered in Topeka, Kansas. During April 2019, the Bank completed the integration of the operations of Capital City Bank into the Bank's operations. The acquisition of Capital City Bank has allowed us to advance our commercial banking strategy while staying under $10 billion in assets, and allowed us to offer trust and brokerage services. The Bank competes for commercial banking business through a wide variety of commercial deposit and expanded lending products.
We have been, and intend to continue to be, a community-oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities we serve. We attract deposits primarily from the general public and from businesses, and invest those funds primarily in permanent loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied, one- to four-family residences. We also originate and participate with other lenders in commercial loans, originate consumer loans primarily secured by mortgages on one- to four-family residences, and invest in certain investment securities and mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") using funding from deposits, repurchase agreements, and Federal Home Loan Bank Topeka ("FHLB") borrowings. We offer a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms, which generally include savings accounts, money market accounts, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing checking accounts, and certificates of deposit with terms ranging from 91 days to 96 months.
The Company's results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities, and cash, and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. On a weekly basis, management reviews deposit flows, loan demand, cash levels, and changes in several market rates to assess all pricing strategies. The Bank's pricing strategy for first mortgage loan products includes setting interest rates based on secondary market prices and competitor pricing for our local lending markets, and secondary market prices and competitor pricing for our correspondent lending markets. Pricing for commercial loans is generally based on competitor pricing and the credit risk of the borrower with consideration given to the overall relationship of the borrower. Generally, deposit pricing is based upon a survey of competitors in the Bank's market areas, and the need to attract funding and retain maturing deposits. The majority of our loans are fixed-rate products with maturities up to 30 years, while the majority of our retail deposits are either non-maturity deposits or have stated maturities of less than two years.
The Company is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions, including federal monetary and fiscal policies and federal regulation of financial institutions. Deposit balances are influenced by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on competing investment products, the level of personal income, and the personal rate of savings within our market areas. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for housing and business activity levels, our loan underwriting guidelines compared to those of our competitors, as well as interest rate pricing competition from other lending institutions. 
Local economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. The industries in the Bank's local market areas, where the properties securing approximately 66% of the Bank's one- to four-family loans are located, are diversified. This is especially true in the Kansas City metropolitan statistical area, which comprises the largest segment of our one- to four-family loan portfolio and deposit base. Management also monitors broad industry and economic indicators and trends in the states and/or metropolitan statistical areas with the highest concentrations of correspondent purchased loans and commercial real estate loans. As of October 2019, the unemployment rate was 3.1% for Kansas and Missouri, and 3.4% for Texas, compared to the national average of 3.6%, based on information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Kansas City market area has an average household income of approximately $91 thousand per annum, based on 2019 estimates from Claritas Pop-Facts Premier. The average household income in our combined local market areas is approximately $87 thousand per annum, with 92% of the population at or above the poverty level, based on 2019 estimates from Claritas Pop-Facts Premier. The average household income in the Texas region where the majority of our correspondent one- to four-family loans are located is approximately $100 thousand per annum, with 90% of the population at or above the poverty level, based on 2019 estimates from Claritas Pop-Facts Premier. 
Our executive offices are located at 700 South Kansas Avenue, Topeka, Kansas 66603, and our telephone number at that address is (785) 235-1341.

Market Area and Competition
Our corporate office is located in Topeka, Kansas. We currently have a network of 54 branches (44 traditional branches and 10 in-store branches) located in nine counties throughout Kansas and three counties in Missouri. We primarily serve the metropolitan areas of Topeka, Wichita, Lawrence, Manhattan, Emporia, and Salina, Kansas and a portion of the metropolitan area of greater Kansas City. In addition to our full service banking offices, we provide services through our call center, which operates on extended hours, mobile banking, telephone banking, and online banking and bill payment services. 
The Bank ranked first in deposit market share, at 7.41%, in the state of Kansas as reported in the June 30, 2019 FDIC "Summary of Deposits - Market Share Report." Management considers our well-established banking network together with our reputation for financial strength and customer service to be major factors in our success at attracting and retaining customers in our market areas. 
The Bank consistently has been one of the top one- to four-family lenders with regard to mortgage loan origination volume in the state of Kansas. Through our strong relationships with real estate agents and marketing efforts, which reflect our reputation, and pricing, we attract mortgage loan business from walk-in customers, customers that apply online, and existing customers. Competition in originating one- to four-family loans primarily comes from other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, and mortgage bankers.

Lending Practices and Underwriting Standards
General. Originating and purchasing loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties is the Bank's primary lending business, resulting in a loan concentration in residential first mortgage loans secured by properties located in Kansas and Missouri. The Bank also originates and participates in commercial loans, and originates consumer loans and construction loans secured by residential properties. 
One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending. The Bank originates and services one- to four-family loans that are not guaranteed or insured by the federal government, and purchases one- to four-family loans, on a loan-by-loan basis, from a select group of correspondent lenders. 
Originated Loans
While the Bank originates both fixed- and adjustable-rate loans, our origination volume is dependent upon customer demand for loans in our market areas. Demand is affected by the local housing market, competition, and the interest rate environment. During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the Bank originated and refinanced $581.1 million and $543.5 million of one- to four-family loans, respectively.
Correspondent Purchased Loans 
The Bank purchases one- to four-family loans, on a loan-by-loan basis, from a select group of correspondent lenders. Loan purchases enable the Bank to attain geographic diversification in the loan portfolio. At September 30, 2019, the Bank had correspondent lending relationships in 28 states and the District of Columbia. During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the Bank purchased $166.4 million and $391.6 million, respectively, of one- to four-family loans from correspondent lenders. We generally pay a premium of 0.50% to 1.0% of the loan balance to purchase these loans, and we pay 1.0% of the loan balance to purchase the servicing of these loans.
The Bank has an agreement with a third-party mortgage sub-servicer to service loans originated by the Bank's correspondent lenders in certain states. The sub-servicer has experience servicing loans in the market areas in which the Bank purchases loans and services the loans according to the Bank's servicing standards, which is intended to allow the Bank greater control over servicing and reporting and help maintain a standard of loan performance. 
Bulk Purchased Loans 
In the past, the Bank has also purchased one- to four-family loans from correspondent and nationwide lenders in bulk loan packages. The last bulk loan package purchase by the Bank was in August 2012. The Bank no longer purchases bulk loan packages. See "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" for additional information regarding why the Bank no longer purchases bulk loan packages.
The servicing rights associated with bulk purchased loans were generally retained by the lender/seller for the loans purchased from nationwide lenders. The servicing by nationwide lenders is governed by a servicing agreement, which outlines collection policies and procedures, as well as oversight requirements, such as servicer certifications attesting to and providing proof of compliance with the servicing agreement.
At September 30, 2019, $178.5 million, or 71% of the Bank's bulk purchased loan portfolio, are loans guaranteed by one seller. Based on the historical performance of these loans and the seller, the Bank believes the seller has the financial ability to repurchase or replace loans if any were to become delinquent. The Bank has not experienced any losses with this group of loans since the loan package was purchased in August 2012. For the $73.8 million of bulk purchased loans at September 30, 2019 that do not have the above noted guarantee, the Bank has continued to experience a reduction in loan losses. See "Asset Quality - Allowance for credit losses and Provision for credit losses" below for additional information regarding loan losses for bulk purchased loans. 
Underwriting
Full documentation to support an applicant's credit and income, and sufficient funds to cover all applicable fees and reserves at closing, are required on all loans. Generally, loans are underwritten according to the "ability to repay" and "qualified mortgage" standards, as issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"). Information pertaining to the creditworthiness of the borrower generally consists of a summary of the borrower's credit history, employment stability, sources of income, assets, net worth, and debt ratios. The value of the subject property must be supported by an appraisal 
report prepared in accordance with our appraisal policy by either a staff appraiser or a fee appraiser, both of which are independent of the loan origination function.
The underwriting standards for loans purchased from correspondent and nationwide lenders are generally similar to the Bank's internal underwriting standards. The underwriting of correspondent loans is performed by the Bank's underwriters. Our standard contractual agreement with the lender/seller includes recourse options for any breach of representation or warranty with respect to the loans purchased. The Bank did not request any lenders/sellers to repurchase loans for breach of representation during fiscal year 2019.
Adjustable-rate Mortgage ("ARM") Loans 
ARM loans are offered with a three-year, five-year, or seven-year term to the initial repricing date. After the initial period, the interest rate for each ARM loan adjusts annually for the remainder of the term of the loan. Currently, the repricing index for loan originations and correspondent purchases is tied to the one-year Constant Maturity Treasury ("CMT") index; however, other indices have been used in the past, including LIBOR. Current adjustable-rate one- to four-family loans originated by the Bank generally provide for a specified rate limit or cap on the periodic adjustment to the interest rate, as well as a specified maximum lifetime cap and minimum rate, or floor. As a consequence of using caps, the interest rates on these loans may not be as rate sensitive as our cost of funds. Negative amortization of principal is not allowed. For three- and five-year ARM loans, borrowers are qualified based on the principal, interest, tax, and insurance payments at the initial interest rate plus the life of loan cap and the initial interest rate plus the first period cap, respectively. For seven-year ARM loans, borrowers are qualified based on the principal, interest, tax, and insurance payments at the initial rate. After the initial three-, five-, or seven-year period, the interest rate resets annually and the new principal and interest payment is based on the new interest rate, remaining unpaid principal balance, and remaining term of the ARM loan. Our ARM loans are not automatically convertible into fixed-rate loans; however, we do allow borrowers to pay an endorsement fee to convert an ARM loan into a fixed-rate loan. ARM loans can pose greater credit risks than fixed-rate loans, primarily because if interest rates rise, the borrower's payment also rises, increasing the potential for default. This specific type of risk is known as repricing risk. 
Pricing
Our pricing strategy for one- to four-family loan products includes setting interest rates based on secondary market prices and local competitor pricing for our local lending markets, and secondary market prices and national competitor pricing for our correspondent markets. 
Mortgage Insurance
For a one- to four-family loan with a loan-to-value ("LTV") ratio in excess of 80% at the time of origination, private mortgage insurance ("PMI") is required in order to reduce the Bank's loss exposure. The Bank will lend up to 97% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price for one- to four-family loans, provided PMI is obtained. Management continuously monitors the claim-paying ability of our PMI counterparties. We believe our PMI counterparties have the ability to meet potential claim obligations we may file in the foreseeable future.
Repayment
The Bank's one- to four-family loans are primarily fully amortizing fixed-rate or ARM loans. The contractual maturities for fixed-rate loans and ARM loans can be up to 30 years; however, there are certain bulk purchased ARM loans that had original contractual maturities of 40 years. Our one- to four-family loans are generally not assumable and do not contain prepayment penalties. A "due on sale" clause, allowing the Bank to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the secured property, is generally included in the security instrument. 
Construction Lending
The Bank originates owner-occupied construction-to-permanent loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate. The majority of these loans are secured by property located within the Bank's Kansas City market area. At September 30, 2019, we had $36.8 million in one- to four-family construction loans outstanding, representing 0.5% of our total loan portfolio.
The application process for a construction loan includes submission of complete plans, specifications, and costs of the project to be constructed. Construction draw requests and the supporting documentation are reviewed and approved by authorized management or experienced construction loan personnel. The Bank also performs regular documented inspections of the construction project to ensure the funds are being used for the intended purpose. Interest is not capitalized during the construction period; it is billed and collected monthly based on the amount of funds disbursed. 
The Bank's owner-occupied construction-to-permanent loan program combines the construction loan and the permanent loan into one loan, allowing the borrower to secure the same interest rate structure throughout the construction period and the permanent loan term. Once the construction period is complete, the payment method is changed from interest-only to an amortized principal and interest payment for the remaining term of the loan. 
Loan Endorsement Program
In an effort to offset the impact of repayments and to retain our customers, existing loan customers, including customers whose loans were purchased from a correspondent lender, have the opportunity, for a cash fee, to endorse their original loan terms to current loan terms being offered. Customers whose loans have been sold to third parties, or have been delinquent on their contractual loan payments during the previous 12 months, or are currently in bankruptcy, are not eligible to participate in this program. The Bank does not solicit customers for this program, but considers it a valuable opportunity to retain customers who, based on our initial underwriting criteria, could likely obtain similar financing elsewhere. During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the Bank endorsed $121.5 million and $19.4 million of one- to four-family loans, respectively. 
Loan Sales
One- to four-family loans may be sold on a bulk basis or on a flow basis as loans are originated. Loans originated by the Bank and purchased from correspondent lenders are generally eligible for sale in the secondary market. Loans are generally sold for portfolio restructuring purposes, to reduce interest rate risk and/or to maintain a certain liquidity position. The Bank generally retains the servicing on these loans. The Bank's Asset and Liability Management Committee ("ALCO") determines the criteria upon which one- to four-family loans are to be classified as held-for-sale or held-for-investment. One- to four-family loans classified as held-for-sale are to be sold in accordance with policies set forth by ALCO. During fiscal year 2019, the Bank did not sell any loans. During fiscal year 2018, the Bank sold $16.6 million of one- to four-family loans, to test loan sale processes for liquidity purposes.
Consumer Lending. The Bank offers a variety of secured consumer loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, home improvement loans, vehicle loans, and loans secured by savings deposits. The Bank also originates a very limited amount of unsecured loans. Generally, consumer loans are originated in the Bank's market areas. The majority of our consumer loan portfolio is comprised of home equity lines of credit which have adjustable interest rates. For a majority of the home equity lines of credit, the Bank has the first mortgage or the Bank is in the first lien position. At September 30, 2019, our consumer loan portfolio totaled $131.8 million, or approximately 2% of our total loan portfolio. 
The underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts and an assessment of the applicant's ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security in relation to the proposed loan amount. 
Consumer loans generally have shorter terms-to-maturity or reprice more frequently, usually without periodic caps, which reduces our exposure to credit risk and changes in interest rates, and usually carry higher rates of interest than do one- to four-family loans. Management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities.
Commercial Lending. At September 30, 2019, the Bank's commercial loans totaled $767.9 million, or approximately 10% of our total loan portfolio. Of this amount, $360.8 million were participation loans. Total undisbursed loan amounts related to commercial loans were $138.8 million, resulting in a total commercial loan concentration of $906.7 million at September 30, 2019. 
At September 30, 2019, the Bank's commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled $706.8 million or approximately 92% of our commercial loan portfolio. Our commercial real estate loans include a variety of property types, including hotels, office and retail buildings, senior housing facilities, and multi-family dwellings located in Kansas, Missouri, and 11 other states. Our largest commercial lending relationship was $98.9 million at September 30, 2019, of which $94.1 million was disbursed, including $90.8 million in commercial real estate loans and $3.3 million in commercial and industrial loans. These loans were current according to their terms at September 30, 2019.
At September 30, 2019, the Bank's commercial and industrial loan portfolio totaled $61.1 million, or approximately 8% of our commercial loan portfolio. The Bank's commercial and industrial loan portfolio consists largely of loans secured by accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.
Underwriting
The Bank performs more extensive due diligence in underwriting commercial loans than loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties due to the larger loan amounts, the more complex sources of repayment and the riskier nature of such loans. When participating in a commercial loan, the Bank performs the same underwriting procedures as if the loan was being originated by the Bank. 
When underwriting a commercial real estate loan, several factors are considered, such as the income producing potential of the property to support the debt service, cash equity provided by the borrower, the financial strength of the borrower, tenant and/or guarantor(s), managerial expertise of the borrower or tenant, feasibility studies from the borrower or an independent third party, the marketability of the property and our lending experience with the borrower. For non-owner occupied properties, the Bank has a pre-lease requirement, depending on the property type, and overall strength of the credit. 
For non-construction properties, the historical net operating income, which is the income derived from the operation of the property less all operating expenses, generally must be at least 1.15 times the required payments related to the outstanding debt (debt service coverage ratio) at the time of origination. For construction projects, the minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.15 applies to the projected cash flows, and the borrower must have successful experience with the construction and operation of properties similar to the subject property. As part of the underwriting process, the historical or projected cash flows are stressed under various scenarios to measure the viability of the project given adverse conditions. 
Generally, our maximum LTV ratios conform to supervisory limits, including 65% for raw land, 75% for land development and 85% for commercial real estate loans. In accordance with regulatory guidelines, the Bank requires full independent appraisals for commercial real estate properties. The Bank generally requires at least 15% cash equity from the borrower for land acquisition, land development and commercial real estate construction loans. For non-acquisition, development or construction loans, the equity may be from a combination of cash and the appraised value of the secured property. 
Our commercial and industrial loans are primarily made in the Bank's market areas and are underwritten on the basis of the borrower's ability to service the debt from income. Other sources of repayment include the collateral underlying the loans and guarantees from business owners. Working capital loans are primarily collateralized by short-term assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long-term assets. 
In general, commercial and industrial loans involve more credit risk than commercial real estate loans. The increased risk in commercial and industrial loans is due to the type of collateral securing these loans as well as the expectation that commercial and industrial loans generally will be serviced principally from the operations of the business, and those operations may not be successful. Significant adverse changes in borrowers' industries and businesses could cause a rapid decline in the values of, and collectability associated with, business assets securing the loans, which could result in inadequate collateral coverage of our commercial and industrial loans. Additionally, commercial and industrial loans secured by accounts receivable may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from clients and loans secured by inventory and equipment are subject to depreciation over time and may be difficult to appraise. As a result of these additional complexities, variables and risks, commercial and industrial loans require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of commercial loans.
Loan Terms
Commercial loans generally have amortization terms of 15 to 30 years and maturities ranging from 90 days to 20 years, which generally requires balloon payments of the remaining principal balance. 
Commercial loans have either fixed or adjustable interest rates based on prevailing market rates. The interest rate on adjustable-rate loans is based on a variety of indices, but is generally determined through negotiation with the borrower or determined by the lead bank in the case of a loan participation. 
For a construction loan, generally, the Bank allows interest-only payments during the construction phase of a project and for a stabilization period of 6 to 24 months after occupancy. The Bank requires amortizing payments at the conclusion of the stabilization period.
Additionally, the Bank may include covenants in the loan agreement that allow the Bank to take action when deterioration in the financial strength of the project is detected to potentially prevent the credit from becoming impaired. The covenants are specific to each loan agreement, based on factors such as the purpose of funds, the collateral type, and the financial strength of the project, the borrower and the guarantor, among other factors. 
Monitoring of Risk
For the Bank's commercial real estate loan portfolio, borrowers with a loan principal balance of $1.5 million or more are required to provide financial information annually, including borrower financial statements, subject property rental rates and income, maintenance costs, an update of real estate property tax and insurance payments, and personal financial information for the guarantor(s). The annual review process for loans with a principal balance of $1.5 million or more allows the Bank to monitor compliance with loan covenants and review the borrower's performance, including cash flows from operations, debt service coverage, and comparison of performance to projections and year-over-year performance trending. Additionally, the Bank performs a site visit, schedules a drive-by site visit or obtains an update from the lead bank to obtain information regarding the maintenance of the property and surrounding area. Depending on the financial strength of the project and/or the complexity of the borrower's financials, the Bank may also perform a global analysis of cash flows to account for all other properties owned by the borrower or guarantor. If signs of weakness are identified, the Bank may begin performing more frequent financial and/or collateral reviews or will initiate contact with the borrower, or the lead bank will contact the borrower if the loan is a participation loan, to ensure cash flows from operations are maintained at a satisfactory level to meet the debt requirements. Both macro-level and loan-level stress-test scenarios based on existing and forecasted market conditions are part of the on-going portfolio management process for the commercial real estate portfolio.
Commercial real estate construction lending generally involves a greater degree of risk than commercial real estate lending. Repayment of a construction loan is, to a great degree, dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the construction of the subject property. Construction delays, slower than anticipated stabilization or the financial impairment of the builder may negatively affect the borrower's ability to repay the loan. The Bank takes these risks into consideration during the underwriting process including the requirement of personal guarantees. The Bank mitigates the risk of commercial real estate construction lending during the construction period by monitoring inspection reports from an independent third-party, project budget, percentage of completion, on-site inspections and percentage of advanced funds.
Commercial and industrial loans are monitored through a review of borrower performance as indicated by borrower financial statements, borrowing base reports, accounts receivable aging reports, and inventory aging reports. These reports are required to be provided by the borrowers monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on the nature of the borrowing relationship. 
Our commercial loans are generally large dollar loans and involve a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family loans. Because payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties and/or businesses, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the economy, the borrower's line of business, and/or the real estate market. If the cash flows from the project or business operation is reduced, or if leases are not obtained or renewed, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may become impaired. The Bank regularly monitors the level of risk in the portfolio, including concentrations in such factors as geographic locations, collateral types, tenant brand name, borrowing relationships, and lending relationships in the case of participation loans, among other factors.

Asset Quality
The Bank's traditional one- to four-family underwriting guidelines have provided the Bank with generally low delinquencies and low levels of non-performing assets within this loan category compared to national levels. Of particular importance is the complete and full documentation required for each loan the Bank originates, participates in or purchases. Generally, one- to four-family owner occupied loans are underwritten according to the "ability to repay" and "qualified mortgage" standards, as issued by the CFPB. This allows the Bank to make an informed credit decision based upon a thorough assessment of the borrower's ability to repay the loan. 
For one- to four-family loans and consumer loans, when a borrower fails to make a loan payment within 10 to 15 days after the due date, a late charge is assessed and a notice is mailed. Collection personnel review all delinquent loan accounts more than 16 days past due. Attempts to contact the borrower occur by personal letter and, if no response is received, by telephone, with the purpose of establishing repayment arrangements for the borrower to bring the loan current. Repayment arrangements must be approved by a designated bank employee. For residential mortgage loans serviced by the Bank, beginning at approximately the 31st day of delinquency, and again at approximately the 50th day of delinquency, information notices are mailed to borrowers to inform them of the availability of payment assistance programs. Borrowers are encouraged to contact the Bank to initiate the process of reviewing such opportunities. Once a loan becomes 90 days delinquent, assuming a loss mitigation solution is not actively in process, a demand letter is issued requiring the loan be brought current or foreclosure procedures will be implemented. Generally, when a loan becomes 120 days delinquent, and an acceptable repayment plan or loss mitigation solution has neither been established nor is in the process of being negotiated, the loan is forwarded to legal counsel to initiate foreclosure. We also monitor whether borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy are meeting their obligation to pay the mortgage debt in accordance with the terms of the bankruptcy petition.
For purchased loans serviced by a third party, we monitor delinquencies using reports received from the servicers. The reports generally provide total principal and interest due and length of delinquency, and are used to prepare monthly management reports and perform delinquent loan trend analysis. The information from the sub-servicer of our correspondent loans is generally received during the first week of the month while the information from the servicers of our bulk loans is received later in the month. Management also utilizes information from the servicers to monitor property valuations and identify the need to charge-off loan balances. 
For commercial loans originated by the Bank, when a borrower fails to make a loan payment within 10 days after the due date, a late notice is mailed. If the loan becomes 30 days or more past due, the Bank begins collection efforts including sending legal notices for payment collection and contacting the borrower by telephone. The primary purpose of such contact is to notify the borrower of the past due payment in case the loan payment was misplaced or lost and to identify any changes in the borrower's income flow that may affect future loan performance. If it is determined that future loan performance may be adversely affected, the Bank initiates discussions with the borrower regarding plans to ensure cash flow from operations is sufficient to satisfy the debt requirements and meet the loan covenants. Generally, once a loan becomes 90 days delinquent, foreclosure or collection procedures are initiated. For participation loans, the lead bank is responsible for all collection efforts and contact with the borrower. However, if the Bank does not receive an expected payment on a participation loan, the Bank contacts the lead bank to determine the cause of the late payment and to initiate discussions with the lead bank of collection efforts, as necessary. See "Lending Practices and Underwriting Standards – Commercial Lending – Monitoring of Risk" for additional information.

The table below presents the Company's non-performing loans and OREO at the dates indicated. The amounts in the table represent the unpaid principal balance of the loans less related charge-offs. Non-performing loans are loans that are 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure and other loans required to be reported as nonaccrual pursuant to accounting and/or regulatory reporting requirements, even if the loans are current. At all dates presented, there were no loans 90 or more days delinquent that were still accruing interest. Non-performing assets include non-performing loans and OREO. OREO primarily includes assets acquired in settlement of loans. Over the past 12 months, one- to four-family OREO properties acquired in settlement of one- to four-family loans were owned by the Bank, on average, for approximately four months before the properties were sold.

(1) | Includes loans required to be reported as nonaccrual pursuant to accounting and/or regulatory reporting requirements, even if the loans are current. The decrease in the balance of these loans at September 30, 2017 compared to September 30, 2016 was due to fewer loans being classified as troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") as a result of management refining its methodology for assessing whether a loan modification qualifies as a TDR. 


(2) | Real estate-related consumer loans where we also hold the first mortgage are included in the one- to four-family category as the underlying collateral is one- to four-family property.

The amount of interest income on nonaccrual loans and TDRs as of September 30, 2019 included in interest income was $988 thousand for the year ended September 30, 2019.  The amount of additional interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans and TDRs as of September 30, 2019, if they had performed in accordance with their original terms, was $66 thousand for the year ended September 30, 2019.

Classified Assets. In accordance with the Bank's asset classification policy, management regularly reviews the problem assets in the Bank's portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 5. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses" for asset classification definitions. 
The following table sets forth the recorded investment in assets, classified as either special mention or substandard, as of September 30, 2019. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 5. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses" for information regarding asset classification definitions. During the June 30, 2019 quarter, management classified a $50.0 million commercial real estate participation loan as special mention. The loan has been in the portfolio for approximately 3.5 years, with approximately 1.5 years remaining, and relates to a recently opened large hotel and convention center in a high growth area in the central-southern United States. Management identified credit weaknesses associated with this loan, including a debt service coverage ratio below policy, the development surrounding the hotel and convention center has been slower than initially anticipated, and construction delays have occurred. The Bank has personal guarantees from members of a financially strong borrowing group, and the loan was current according to its terms as of September 30, 2019. Management continues to closely monitor the hotel and convention center and surrounding activities. At September 30, 2019, there were no loans classified as doubtful, and all loans classified as loss were fully charged-off.

Troubled Debt Restructurings. For borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, the Bank may grant a concession to the borrower, resulting in a TDR. Such concessions generally involve extensions of loan maturity dates, the granting of periods during which reduced payment amounts are required, reductions in interest rates, and/or loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings where the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt. The Bank does not forgive principal or interest, nor does it commit to lend additional funds, except for situations generally involving the capitalization of delinquent interest and/or escrow on one- to four-family and consumer loans, not to exceed the original loan balance, to these borrowers. For commercial loans, the Bank does not forgive principal or interest or commit to lend additional funds unless the borrower provides additional collateral or other enhancements to improve credit quality. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses" for additional information related to TDRs.
The following table presents the Company's TDRs, based on accrual status, at the dates indicated.

Impaired Loans. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. Interest income on impaired loans is recognized in the period collected unless the ultimate collection of principal is considered doubtful. The unpaid principal balance of loans reported as impaired at September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $23.4 million, $29.9 million, and $44.4 million, respectively. Included in the impaired loan balance at September 30, 2019 were $23.2 million of loans classified as either special mention or substandard.
See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses" for additional information related to impaired loans.
Allowance for credit losses and Provision for credit losses. Management maintains an ACL to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio based on quarterly assessments of the loan portfolio. The ACL is maintained through provisions for credit losses which are either charged to or credited to income. Our ACL methodology considers a number of factors including the trend and composition of delinquent loans, trends in foreclosed property transactions and charge-off activity, the current status and trends of local and national employment levels, trends and current conditions in the real estate and housing markets, loan portfolio growth and concentrations, industry and peer charge-off activity and ACL ratios, and the Bank's ACL ratios. For our commercial loan portfolio, we also consider qualitative factors such as geographic locations, collateral types, tenant brand name, borrowing relationships, and lender relationships in the case of participation loans, among other factors. See "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses" and "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for a full discussion of our ACL methodology. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 5. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses" for additional information on the ACL.
Each quarter we prepare a formula analysis model which segregates the loan portfolio into categories based on certain risk characteristics. Historical loss factors and qualitative factors are applied to each loan category in the formula analysis model. The factors are reviewed by management quarterly to assess whether the factors adequately cover probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. To the extent the commercial loan portfolio continues to grow and the inherent loss factors remain relatively constant and/or the asset quality declines, the related ACL amounts will likely increase.
The Bank recorded a $750 thousand provision for credit losses during the current fiscal year compared to no provision for credit losses in the prior fiscal year. The provision for credit losses in the current fiscal year was due primarily to commercial loan activities during the current fiscal year, specifically the classification of a large commercial participation loan as special mention, commercial loan growth and funding, certain commercial loans that renewed since being obtained in the CCB acquisition and are now in the Bank's ACL model, and commercial loan charge-offs. 
The following table presents ACL activity and related ratios at the dates and for the periods indicated.

The majority of the CCB loans acquired were not deemed purchased credit impaired ("PCI") as of the acquisition date ("non-PCI loans"). The net purchase discounts associated with non-PCI loans were compared to the amount of hypothetical ACL estimated for these loans at September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018. See "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses" for additional information regarding management's estimation of the hypothetical ACL for non-PCI loans. As a result of this analysis, management determined the net purchase discounts were sufficient and no ACL was required on those loans at September 30, 2019 or September 30, 2018. 

Investment Activities
Federally chartered savings institutions have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations; securities of various federal agencies; government-sponsored enterprises ("GSEs"), including callable agency securities; municipal bonds; certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions; certain bankers' acceptances; repurchase agreements; and federal funds. Subject to various restrictions, federally chartered savings institutions may also invest their assets in investment grade commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that a federally chartered savings institution is otherwise authorized to make directly. As a member of FHLB, the Bank is required to maintain a specified investment in FHLB stock. See "Regulation and Supervision – Federal Home Loan Bank System" and "Office of the Comptroller of the Currency" for a discussion of additional restrictions on our investment activities. 
ALCO considers various factors when making investment decisions, including the liquidity, credit, interest rate risk, and tax consequences of the proposed investment options. The composition of the investment portfolio will be affected by various market conditions, including the slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the impact on the Bank's interest rate risk, the trend of net deposit flows, the volume of loan sales, repayments of borrowings, and loan originations and purchases.
The general objectives of the Bank's investment portfolio are to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, to assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low, and to maximize earnings while satisfactorily managing liquidity risk, interest rate risk, reinvestment risk, and credit risk. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. Cash flow projections are reviewed regularly and updated to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained.
We have the ability to classify securities as either trading, available-for-sale ("AFS"), or held-to-maturity ("HTM") at the date of purchase. Securities that are purchased and held principally for resale in the near future are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in the consolidated statements of income. AFS securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") within stockholders' equity, net of deferred income taxes. HTM securities are reported at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount. Effective September 30, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities and certain components of ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments that are applicable to ASU 2017-12. As part of the adoption, the Company reclassified its entire portfolio of HTM securities, totaling $444.7 million at amortized cost, to AFS securities. 
On a quarterly basis, management reviews securities for the presence of an other-than-temporary impairment. The process involves monitoring market events and other items that could impact issuers. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for additional information. Management does not believe any other-than-temporary impairments existed at September 30, 2019.
Investment Securities. Our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of debentures issued by GSEs (primarily Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA"), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC") and the Federal Home Loan Banks) and non-taxable municipal bonds. At September 30, 2019, our investment securities portfolio totaled $268.4 million. The portfolio consisted entirely of securities classified as AFS. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 4. Securities" and "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition – Investment Securities" for additional information.
Mortgage-Backed Securities. At September 30, 2019, our MBS portfolio totaled $936.5 million. The portfolio consisted entirely of securities classified as AFS and were primarily issued by GSEs. The principal and interest payments of MBS issued by GSEs are collateralized by the underlying mortgage assets with principal and interest payments guaranteed by the GSEs. The underlying mortgage assets are conforming mortgages that comply with FNMA and FHLMC underwriting guidelines, as applicable, and are therefore not considered subprime. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 4. Securities" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition – Mortgage-Backed Securities" for additional information.
MBS generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the servicing fee retained by the servicer and the cost of payment guarantees or credit enhancements retained by the GSEs that reduce credit risk. However, MBS are generally more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize certain borrowings and public unit deposits of the Bank. In general, MBS issued or guaranteed by FNMA and FHLMC are weighted at no more than 20% for risk-based capital purposes compared to the 50% risk-weighting assigned to most non-securitized one- to four-family loans. 
When securities are purchased for a price other than par value, the difference between the price paid and par is accreted to or amortized against the interest earned over the life of the security, depending on whether a discount or premium to par was paid. Movements in interest rates affect prepayment rates which, in turn, affect the average lives of MBS and the speed at which the discount or premium is accreted to or amortized against earnings.
At September 30, 2019, the MBS portfolio included $108.0 million of collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs"). CMOs are special types of MBS in which the stream of principal and interest payments on the underlying mortgages or MBS are used to create investment classes with different maturities and, in some cases, different amortization schedules, as well as a residual interest, with each such class possessing different risk characteristics. We do not purchase residual interest bonds. 
While MBS issued by FNMA and FHLMC carry a reduced credit risk compared to whole mortgage loans, these securities remain subject to the risk that a fluctuating interest rate environment, along with other factors such as the geographic distribution of the underlying mortgage loans, may alter the prepayment rate of the underlying mortgage loans and consequently affect both the prepayment speed and value of the securities. As noted above, the Bank, on some transactions, pays a premium over par value on MBS purchased. Large premiums could cause significant negative yield adjustments due to accelerated prepayments on the underlying mortgages. The balance of net premiums on our portfolio of MBS at September 30, 2019 was $2.3 million.
The following table sets forth the composition of our investment and MBS portfolios as of the dates indicated.  At September 30, 2019, our investment securities portfolio did not contain securities of any issuer with an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of our stockholders' equity, excluding those issued by GSEs.

Sources of Funds
General. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, FHLB borrowings, repurchase agreements, repayments and maturities of outstanding loans and MBS and other short-term investments, and funds provided by operations.
Deposits. We offer a variety of retail deposit accounts and commercial deposit accounts and services. Our deposit account offerings have a wide range of interest rates and terms. Our deposits consist of savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing checking accounts, and certificates of deposit. We rely primarily upon competitive pricing policies, marketing, and customer service to attract and retain deposits. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and prevailing interest rates, and competition. The variety of deposit accounts we offer has allowed us to utilize strategic pricing to obtain funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand. We seek to manage the pricing of our deposits in keeping with our asset and liability management, liquidity, and profitability objectives. Based on our experience, we believe that our deposits are stable sources of funds. Despite this stability, our ability to attract and maintain these deposits and the rates paid on them has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by market conditions. 
The Board of Directors has authorized the utilization of brokers to obtain deposits as a source of funds. Depending on market conditions, the Bank may use brokered deposits to fund asset growth and gather deposits that may help to manage interest rate risk. No brokered deposits were acquired during fiscal year 2019 and there were no brokered deposits outstanding at September 30, 2019 or 2018.
The Board of Directors also has authorized the utilization of public unit certificates of deposit as a source of funds. In order to qualify to obtain such deposits, the Bank must have a branch in each county in which it collects public unit certificates of deposit and, by law, must pledge securities as collateral for all such balances in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. At September 30, 2019 and 2018, the balance of public unit certificates of deposit was $294.9 million and $407.7 million, respectively.
As of September 30, 2019, the Bank's policy allows for combined brokered and public unit certificates of deposit up to 15% of total deposits. At September 30, 2019, that amount was approximately 5% of total deposits.
Borrowings. We utilize borrowings when we need additional capacity to fund loan demand or when they help us meet our asset and liability management objectives. Historically, our term borrowings have consisted primarily of FHLB advances. FHLB advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, maturity, repayment, and embedded options, if any. At September 30, 2019, $1.40 billion of our FHLB advances were fixed-rate advances with no embedded options and $640.0 million of our FHLB advances were variable-rate, also with no embedded options. The variable-rate advances are tied to interest rate swaps, effectively converting the adjustable-rate borrowings into fixed-rate liabilities. The Bank supplements FHLB borrowings with repurchase agreements, wherein the Bank enters into agreements with Board-approved counterparties to sell securities under agreements to repurchase them. These agreements are recorded as financing transactions as the Bank maintains effective control over the transferred securities. Repurchase agreements are made at mutually agreed upon terms between counterparties and the Bank. The use of repurchase agreements allows for the diversification of funding sources and the use of securities that were not being leveraged as collateral. The Bank also regularly uses its FHLB line of credit as a source of funding. The Bank's internal policy limits total borrowings to 55% of total assets.
During fiscal year 2019, the Bank continued, at times, to utilize a leverage strategy (the "leverage strategy") to increase earnings. The leverage strategy during the current fiscal year involved borrowing up to $2.10 billion either on the Bank's FHLB line of credit or by entering into short-term FHLB advances, depending on the rates offered by FHLB. The borrowings were repaid prior to each quarter end, or earlier if the strategy was suspended. The proceeds of the borrowings, net of the required FHLB stock holdings, were deposited at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City ("FRB of Kansas City"). Management suspended the strategy during the majority of fiscal year 2019 due to the large negative interest rate spread making the strategy unprofitable. Management continues to monitor the net interest rate spread and overall profitability of the strategy. It is expected that the strategy will be reimplemented if it reaches a position that is profitable.
At September 30, 2019, we had $2.04 billion of FHLB advances, at par, outstanding and $100.0 million outstanding on the Bank's FHLB line of credit. Total FHLB borrowings are secured by certain qualifying loans pursuant to a blanket collateral agreement with FHLB. Per FHLB's lending guidelines, total FHLB borrowings cannot exceed 40% of Bank Call Report total assets without the pre-approval of FHLB senior management. In July 2019, the president of the FHLB renewed the approval of the increase in the Bank's borrowing limit to 55% of Bank Call Report total assets through July 2020. This approval was also in place throughout fiscal year 2019. When the full leverage strategy is in place, FHLB borrowings may be in excess of 40% of the Bank's Call Report total assets, and may continue to be in excess of 40% as long as the Bank continues its leverage strategy and FHLB senior management continues to approve the Bank's borrowing limit being in excess of 40% of Call Report total assets.
At September 30, 2019, repurchase agreements totaled $100.0 million, or approximately 1% of total assets. The Bank may enter into additional repurchase agreements as management deems appropriate, not to exceed 15% of total assets and subject to the internal policy limit on total borrowings of 55%. The securities underlying the agreements continue to be reported in the Bank's securities portfolio. At September 30, 2019, we had securities with a fair value of $108.3 million pledged as collateral on repurchase agreements. 
The following table sets forth certain information relating to the category of borrowings for which the average short-term balance outstanding during the period was at least 30% of stockholders' equity at the end of each period shown. The maximum balance, average balance, and weighted average contractual interest rate during the fiscal years shown reflect borrowings that were scheduled to mature within one year at any month-end during those years.

Subsidiary Activities
At September 30, 2019, the Company had one wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. The Bank provides a full range of retail banking services through 54 banking offices serving primarily the metropolitan areas of Topeka, Wichita, Lawrence, Manhattan, Emporia and Salina, Kansas and portions of the metropolitan area of greater Kansas City. At September 30, 2019, the Bank had two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Capitol Funds, Inc. and Capital City Investments, Inc. At September 30, 2019, Capitol Funds, Inc. had one wholly-owned subsidiary, Capitol Federal Mortgage Reinsurance Company ("CFMRC"), which historically served as a reinsurance company for certain PMI companies the Bank uses in its normal course of operations. CFMRC stopped writing new business for the Bank in January 2010. Capital City Investments, Inc. is a real estate and investment holding company. Each wholly-owned subsidiary is reported with the Company on a consolidated basis. 
Regulation and Supervision
Set forth below is a description of certain laws and regulations that are applicable to Capitol Federal Financial, Inc. and the Bank. This description is intended as a brief summary of selected features of such laws and regulations and is qualified in its entirety by references to the laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank.
General. The Bank, as a federally chartered savings bank, is subject to regulation and oversight by the OCC extending to all aspects of its operations. This regulation of the Bank is intended for the protection of depositors and other customers and not for the purpose of protecting the Company's stockholders. The Bank is required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital and is subject to some limitations on capital distributions to the Company. The Bank also is subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of the Bank to the maximum extent permitted by law. 
The Company is a unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners' Loan Act ("HOLA"). As such, the Company is registered with the FRB and subject to the FRB regulations, examinations, supervision, and reporting requirements. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over the Company. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the Bank. 
The OCC and FRB enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil monetary penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders, and to initiate injunctive actions. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed. Except under certain circumstances, public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the OCC or the FRB is required by law.
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The investment and lending authority of the Bank is prescribed by federal laws and regulations and the Bank is prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations. 
As a federally chartered savings bank, the Bank is required to meet a Qualified Thrift Lender ("QTL") test. This test requires the Bank to have at least 65% of its portfolio assets, as defined by statute, in qualified thrift investments at month-end for 9 out of every 12 months on a rolling basis. Under an alternative test, the Bank's business must consist primarily of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in loans, while maintaining 60% of its assets in those assets specified in Section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under either test, the Bank is required to maintain a significant portion of its assets in residential housing related loans and investments. An institution that fails to qualify as a QTL based upon one of these tests is immediately subject to certain restrictions on its operations, including a prohibition against capital distributions, except with the prior approval of both the OCC and the FRB, as necessary to meet the obligations of a company controlling the institution. If the Bank fails the QTL test and does not regain QTL status within one year, or fails the test for a second time, the Company must immediately register as, and become subject to, the restrictions applicable to a bank holding company. The activities authorized for a bank holding company are more limited than are the activities authorized for a savings and loan holding company. Three years after failing the test, an institution must divest all investments and cease all activities not permissible for both a national bank and a savings association. Failure to meet the QTL test is a statutory violation subject to enforcement action. As of September 30, 2019, the Bank met the QTL test.
The Bank is subject to a 35% of total assets limit on non-real estate consumer loans, commercial paper and corporate debt securities, and a 20% limit on commercial non-mortgage loans. At September 30, 2019, the Bank was in compliance with these limits.
The Bank's relationship with its depositors and borrowers is regulated to a great extent by federal laws and regulations, especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of mortgage requirements. In addition, the branching authority of the Bank is regulated by the OCC. The Bank is generally authorized to branch nationwide. 
The Bank is subject to a statutory lending limit on aggregate loans to one person or a group of persons combined because of certain common interests. The general limit is equal to 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus, plus an additional 10% for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral. At September 30, 2019, the Bank's lending limit under this restriction was $176.7 million. The Bank has no loans or loan relationships in excess of its lending limit. Total loan commitments and loans outstanding to the Bank's largest borrowing relationship totaled $98.9 million at September 30, 2019, all of which was current according to its terms.
The Bank is subject to periodic examinations by the OCC. During these examinations, the examiners may require the Bank to increase its ACL, change the classification of loans, and/or recognize additional charge-offs based on their judgments, which can impact our capital and earnings.  As a federally chartered savings bank, the Bank is subject to a semi-annual assessment, based upon its total assets, to fund the operations of the OCC.
The OCC has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings standards, internal controls and audit systems, interest rate risk exposure, and compensation and other employee benefits. Any institution regulated by the OCC that fails to comply with these standards must submit a compliance plan.
Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The DIF of the FDIC insures deposit accounts in the Bank up to applicable limits. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions, and credit unions to $250 thousand per separately insured deposit ownership right or category. 
Under the FDIC's system for assessing insurance premiums, insured institutions that have not reported assets of $10 billion or more at the end of the quarter for at least four consecutive quarters on their Call Reports are assessed based on CAMELS component ratings and certain financial ratios. For these institutions, total base assessment rates currently range from 1.5 to 16 basis points for institutions with CAMELS composite ratings of 1 or 2, 3 to 30 basis points for those with a CAMELS composite score of 3, and 11 to 30 basis points for those with CAMELS composite scores of 4 or 5, all subject to adjustments. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Bank paid $1.1 million in FDIC premiums. Assessment rates are applied to an institution's assessment base, which is its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity during the assessment period.

An institution that has reported total assets at the end of the quarter of $10 billion or more for at least four consecutive quarters is assessed under a complex scorecard method employing many factors, including weighted average CAMELS ratings; a performance score; leverage ratio; ability to withstand asset-related stress; certain measures of concentration, core earnings, core deposits, credit quality, and liquidity; and a loss severity score and loss severity measure. Total base assessment rates for these institutions currently range from 1.5 to 40 basis points, subject to certain adjustments. For all institutions, the base assessment rates are expected to decrease when the reserve ratio increases to specified thresholds of 2% and 2.5%. 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments, and any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Company. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. In a banking industry emergency, the FDIC may also impose a special assessment.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition, or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
The Dodd-Frank Act required large institutions to bear the burden of raising the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. To implement this mandate, large and highly complex institutions paid an annual surcharge of 4.5 basis points on their assessment base through December 28, 2018 as a result of the DIF ratio reaching 1.36%. 

Since established small institutions contributed to the DIF while the reserve ratio was between 1.15% and 1.35%, the FDIC has provided assessment credits to the established small institutions for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the increase. The Bank received $2.8 million in credits to apply to future FDIC assessments. Pursuant to regulatory guidance, once the reserve ratio exceeds 1.38%, credits are allocated to banks with less than $10 billion in assets. These credits will continue to offset the Bank's premium assessments as long as the reserve ratio remains above 1.38% and the Bank still has a remaining credit balance. During fiscal year 2019, the Bank utilized $1.2 million of the credit. As of September 30, 2019, the Bank had a remaining credit of $1.6 million. 
FDIC-insured institutions were required to pay additional quarterly assessments known as "FICO assessments" in order to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s. The rate for these assessments was adjusted quarterly and was applied to the same base used for the deposit insurance assessment. These assessments were discontinued during fiscal year 2019 when the bonds matured. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Bank paid $55 thousand in FICO assessments.
Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates are required to be on terms as favorable to the institution as transactions with non-affiliates, and certain of these transactions are restricted to a percentage of the Bank's capital, and, in the case of loans, require eligible collateral in specified amounts. In addition, the Bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in activities not permissible for a bank holding company or purchase or invest in the securities of affiliates. 
Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Bank and Company are required to maintain specified levels of regulatory capital under regulations of the OCC and FRB, respectively. The current regulatory capital rules, sometimes referred to as the Basel III rules, became effective for the Company and Bank in January 2016, with some rules being transitioned into full effectiveness over two-to-four years and some adjustments being made to selected features of the rules since January 2016. 
Under the Basel III rules, the minimum capital ratios are as follows:

• | 4.5% common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") to risk-weighted assets.


• | 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets.


• | 8.0% total capital to risk-weighted assets.


• | 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on Call Reports, minus certain items deducted from Tier 1 capital (known as the "leverage ratio").

CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital for the Company and the Bank generally consists of common stock plus related surplus and retained earnings, adjusted for goodwill and other intangible assets and AOCI-related amounts. Tier 2 capital for the Company and the Bank includes the balance of ACL; however, the amount of includable ACL in Tier 2 capital may be limited if the amount exceeds 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. At September 30, 2019, the Bank had $9.2 million of ACL, which was less than the 1.25% risk-weighted assets limit; therefore, the entire amount of ACL was includable in Tier 2 and total risk-based capital. Total capital for the Company and the Bank consists of Tier 1 capital plus the amount of includable ACL (Tier 2 capital). 
The Basel III rules require the Company and the Bank to maintain a capital conservation buffer above certain minimum capital ratios in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and other payments including dividends, share repurchases, and certain compensation. The Bank and Company must maintain a balance of capital that exceeds by more than 2.5% each of the minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to satisfy the requirement, so that the required ratios will bear: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of more than 7.0%, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of more than 8.5%, and (3) a total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) ratio of more than 10.5%. At September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Bank and Company held capital in excess of the capital conservation buffer requirement. 
The capital rules assign a risk weight to every asset and to certain off-balance sheet items, such as binding loan commitments, which are multiplied by credit conversion factors to convert them into asset equivalents. The risk weights for the Bank's and Company's assets and off-balance sheet items generally range from 0% to 150%. At September 30, 2019, the Bank and the Company each had total risk-weighted assets of $4.85 billion.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2019, the Bank reported in its Call Report quarterly average assets of $9.69 billion and the Company reported to the FRB quarterly average assets of $9.70 billion.
A depository institution is considered to be well capitalized if it has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or more, (ii) a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or more, (iii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, and (iv) a leverage ratio of 5.0% or more, and is not subject to any of certain specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally. At September 30, 2019, the Bank was considered well capitalized under OCC regulations. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 14. Regulatory Capital Requirements" and "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional regulatory capital information.
In September 2019, the regulatory agencies, including the OCC and FRB, adopted a final rule, effective January 1, 2020, creating a community bank leverage ratio ("CBLR") for institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and that meet other qualifying criteria. The CBLR provides for a simple measure of capital adequacy for qualifying institutions. Qualifying institutions that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9% will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the regulatory agencies' capital rules and to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements. Management is still reviewing the CBLR framework, but expects the Bank and Company will elect to use the CBLR framework.
The OCC has the ability to establish individual minimum capital requirements for a particular institution which vary from the capital levels that would otherwise be required under the capital regulations, based on such factors as concentrations of credit risk, levels of interest rate risk, the risks of non-traditional activities, and other circumstances. The OCC has not imposed any such requirement on the Bank.
The OCC is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against federal savings banks that are considered not to be adequately capitalized because they fail to meet the minimum ratios under the Basel III rules. Any such institution must submit a capital restoration plan for OCC approval and may not increase its assets, acquire another institution, establish a branch or engage in any new activities, and may not make capital distributions. The OCC may impose further restrictions. The plan must include a guaranty by the institution's holding company limited to the lesser of 5% of the institution's assets when it became undercapitalized, or the amount necessary to restore the institution to adequately capitalized status.
Federal regulations state that any institution that fails to comply with its capital plan or has a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% is considered significantly undercapitalized and must be made subject to one or more additional specified actions and restrictions that may cover all aspects of its operations and may include a forced merger or acquisition of the institution. An institution with tangible equity to total assets of less than 2.0% is critically undercapitalized and becomes subject to further mandatory restrictions on its operations. The OCC generally is authorized to reclassify an institution into a lower capital category and impose the restrictions applicable to such category if the institution is engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. The imposition by the OCC of any of these measures on the Bank may have a substantial adverse effect on its operations and profitability. In general, the FDIC must be appointed receiver for a critically undercapitalized institution whose capital is not restored within the time provided. 
When the FDIC as receiver liquidates an institution, the claims of depositors and the FDIC as their successor (for deposits covered by FDIC insurance) have priority over other unsecured claims against the institution.
Community Reinvestment and Consumer Protection Laws. In connection with its lending activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 ("SAFE Act"), and the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"). In addition, federal banking regulators, pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, have enacted regulations limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with non-affiliated parties. With respect to federal consumer protection laws, regulations are generally promulgated by the CFPB, but the OCC examines the Bank for compliance with such laws.
The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of an FDIC-insured institution, to assess its record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The federal banking regulators take into account the institution's record of performance under the CRA when considering applications for mergers, acquisitions, and branches. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve, or substantial non-compliance. The Bank received a satisfactory rating in its most recently completed CRA evaluation. 
Bank Secrecy Act /Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and regulations thereunder. These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity and source of deposits and wealth of its customers. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions. 
Federal Securities Law. The common stock of the Company is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The Company stock held by persons who are affiliates of the Company may not be resold without registration or unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. For this purpose, affiliates are generally considered to be executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. If the Company meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of the Company will be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period. 
Federal Reserve System. The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts, primarily checking accounts. At September 30, 2019, the Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements. The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank "discount window." An eligible institution need not exhaust other sources of funds before going to the discount window, nor are there restrictions on the purposes for which the borrower can use primary credit. At September 30, 2019, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings from the discount window.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks, each of which serves as a reserve, or central bank, for its members within its assigned region and is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It makes loans, called advances, to members and provides access to a line of credit in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 
As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain capital stock in FHLB. The minimum required FHLB stock amount is generally 4.5% of the Bank's FHLB advances and outstanding balance against the FHLB line of credit, and 2% of the outstanding principal of loans sold into the Mortgage Partnership Finance program. At September 30, 2019, the Bank had a balance of $98.5 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. In past years, the Bank has received dividends on its FHLB stock, although no assurance can be given that these dividends will continue. On a quarterly basis, management conducts a review of FHLB to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment of the FHLB stock is present. At September 30, 2019, management concluded there was no such impairment.
Federal Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation. The purpose and powers of the Company are to pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a savings and loan holding company and to exercise any of the powers accorded to a savings and loan holding company. 
The HOLA prohibits a savings and loan holding company (directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries) from acquiring another savings association, or holding company thereof, without prior written approval from the FRB; acquiring or retaining, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary savings association, a non-subsidiary holding company, or a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the HOLA; or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by savings and loan holding companies to acquire savings associations, the FRB must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the 
company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds, the convenience and needs of the community, competitive factors, and other factors. 
The FRB has long set forth in its regulations its "source of strength" policy, which requires holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.  The Dodd-Frank Act extended to savings and loan holding companies and codified the FRB's "source of strength" doctrine, which had applied to bank holding companies before the FRB regulated savings and loan holding companies in addition to bank holding companies.
2018 Regulatory Reform. In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the "Regulatory Relief Act"), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Regulatory Relief Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory changes for community banks such as the Bank, and their holding companies.
The Regulatory Relief Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single CBLR, as described above. In addition, the Regulatory Relief Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
Regulations have been adopted which allow a federal savings association with total consolidated assets of $20 billion or less as of December 31, 2017 to operate as a covered savings association, having generally the same rights, privileges, duties, restrictions, limitations and conditions as a national bank.
Amendments to the Volcker Rule exclude from the definition of "banking entity" certain firms that have total consolidated assets equal to $10 billion or less and total trading assets and liabilities equal to five percent or less of total consolidated assets.
Effective November 24, 2019, the minimum asset threshold for federal savings associations covered by the company-run stress testing requirement was raised from $10 billion to $250 billion in total consolidated assets. 
Taxation
Federal Taxation
General
The Company and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company is no longer subject to federal income tax examination for fiscal years prior to 2016.
Method of Accounting
For federal income tax purposes, the Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a fiscal year ending on September 30 for filing its federal income tax return.
State Taxation 
The earnings/losses of Capitol Federal Financial, Inc., Capitol Funds, Inc. and Capital City Investments, Inc. are combined for purposes of filing a consolidated Kansas corporate tax return.  The Kansas corporate tax rate is 4.0%, plus a surcharge of 3.0% on earnings greater than $50 thousand.
The Bank files a Kansas privilege tax return.  For Kansas privilege tax purposes, the minimum tax rate is 4.5% of earnings, which is calculated based on federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments. The Bank has not received notification from the state of any potential tax liability for any years still subject to audit. 
Additionally, the Bank files state tax returns in various other states where it has significant purchased loans and/or foreclosure activities. In these states, the Bank has either established nexus under an economic nexus theory or has exceeded enumerated nexus thresholds based on the amount of interest derived from sources within the state.
Employees
At September 30, 2019, we had a total of 773 employees, including 128 part-time employees. The full-time equivalent of our total employees at September 30, 2019 was 738. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management considers its employee relations to be good.
