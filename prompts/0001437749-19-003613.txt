ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction and General
 
References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Interface,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer to Interface, Inc. and its subsidiaries or any of them, unless the context requires otherwise.
 
Interface is a global flooring company specializing in carpet tile and resilient flooring, including luxury vinyl tile (“LVT”) and rubber flooring. We help our customers create high-performance interior spaces that support well-being, productivity, and creativity, as well as the sustainability of the planet.
 
We are a worldwide leader in design, production and sales of modular carpet, also known as carpet tile. As a global company with a reputation for high quality, reliability and premium positioning, we market modular carpet in over 110 countries under the established brand names Interface® and FLOR®. Our principal geographic markets are the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific, where the percentages of our total net sales were approximately 58%, 27% and 15%, respectively, for fiscal year 2018.
 
In 2017, we globally launched a line of LVT products, which represented our first introduction into a category of products that we call resilient flooring.
 
On August 7, 2018, the Company acquired nora Holding GmbH (“nora”) a global leader in performance flooring and worldwide leader in the rubber flooring category under the established nora brands norament® and noraplan®. The nora acquisition is expected to advance the Company’s growth strategy in expanding market segments, particularly in the healthcare, life sciences and education market segments. Similar to Interface, nora operates on an international footprint and the Company expects the acquisition will also allow for geographic sales synergies as well. The results of operations for this acquisition have been consolidated with those of the Company from the acquisition date forward.  Due to the nora acquisition, our resilient rubber flooring products accounted for approximately 10% of our sales in 2018.
 
Capitalizing on our acquisition of nora, as well as our leadership in modular carpet for the corporate office market segment, we are executing a market diversification strategy to increase our presence and market share for modular carpet in non-corporate office market segments, such as government, education, healthcare, hospitality and retail space. As a result of our efforts, our mix of corporate office versus non-corporate office modular carpet and LVT sales in the Americas was 45% and 55%, respectively, for 2018. Company-wide, our mix of corporate office versus non-corporate office modular carpet and LVT sales was 60% and 40%, respectively, in 2018.  We believe the appeal and utilization of modular carpet is growing in non-corporate office market segments, and we are using our considerable skills and experience with designing, producing and marketing modular products that make us the market leader in the corporate office segment to support and facilitate our penetration into these segments around the world. Rubber is already an attractive product for non-corporate applications and the acquisition of nora will continue to allow for growth of non-corporate office markets.
 
Our Strengths
 
Our principal competitive strengths include:
 
Market Leader in Attractive Modular Carpet Segment. We are the world’s leading manufacturer of carpet tile. Modular carpet has become more prevalent across all commercial interiors markets as designers, architects and end users have become more familiar with its unique attributes, including its dynamic design capabilities, greater economic value (which includes lower costs as a result of reduced waste in both installation and replacement), and installation ease and speed. We continue to drive this trend with our product innovations and designs discussed below. We believe that we are well positioned to lead and capitalize upon the market for modular carpet, both domestically and around the world.

Established Brands and Reputation for Quality, Reliability and Leadership.  Our products are known in the industry for their high quality, reliability and premium positioning in the marketplace, and our established brand names are leaders in the industry. On the international front, Interface is a well-recognized brand name in carpet tiles for commercial and institutional use. More generally, we believe that as the appeal and utilization of modular carpet continues to expand into market segments such as government, healthcare, education, hospitality, retail and residential space, our reputation as the pioneer of modular carpet — as well as our established brands and leading market position for modular carpet in the corporate office segment — will enhance our competitive advantage in marketing to the customers in these new markets. Our acquisition of nora, which is a global leader in performance flooring, further strengthens our strong global brand reputation.
 
Innovative Product Design and Development Capabilities.  Our product design and development capabilities have long given us a significant competitive advantage, and we believe they continue to do so as modular carpet’s appeal and utilization expand across virtually every market segment and around the globe. One of our recent design innovations is the introduction of long and narrow rectangular carpet tiles in the shape of planks, and even more narrow versions known as Skinny Planks™. The use of planks and Skinny Planks increases the design versatility of our carpet tile, as these products can create aesthetics (such as a herringbone pattern) that are different from, or enhance, that of our traditional square carpet tiles. Nora also offers strong design capabilities and tremendous color palate options to offer attractive and resilient flooring options to our customers.
 
The award-winning design firm David Oakey Designs has had a pivotal role in developing our plank and Skinny Plank products, as well as many of our other innovative product designs, and our long-standing exclusive relationship with David Oakey Designs remains vibrant and augments our internal research, development and design staff. As another example, David Oakey Designs has developed products that are manufactured using state-of-the-art tufting technology which allows us to pinpoint tufts of different colored yarns in virtually any arrangement within a carpet tile. These unique designs are best exemplified by our Urban Retreat®, Net Effect®, Human Nature® and World Woven® collections, which are sold throughout our international operations.
 
Historically, one of our best design innovations is our i2™ modular product line, which includes our popular Entropy® product for which we received a patent in 2005 on the key elements of its design. The i2 line introduced and features mergeable dye lots, and includes a number of carpet tile products that are designed to be installed randomly without reference to the orientation of neighboring tiles. The i2 line offers cost-efficient installation and maintenance, interactive flexibility, and recycled and recyclable materials. Another innovation is our TacTiles® carpet tile installation system, which uses small squares of adhesive plastic film to connect intersecting carpet tiles, thus eliminating the need for traditional carpet adhesive and resulting in a reduction in installation time and material waste.
 
Made-to-Order and Custom Products; Global Manufacturing Capabilities. We have a distinct competitive advantage in meeting two principal requirements of the specified products markets we primarily target — that is, providing made-to-order and custom samples quickly and on-time delivery of made-to-order or customized final products. We also can generate realistic digital samples that allow us to create a virtually unlimited number of new design concepts and distribute them instantly for customer review, while at the same time reducing sampling waste.
 
About half of our modular carpet products worldwide are made-to-order sales, which are not custom products, but are instead standard styles which can be produced once ordered. Our made-to-order capabilities not only enhance our marketing and sales, they significantly improve our inventory turns. Our customized products, which are both custom colors of established styles, as well as limited amounts of true custom carpet designs or configurations, are less than 10% of our global sales. The remainder of our modular carpet sales are serviced from off-the-shelf inventory. The salient terms of our contracts for made-to-order and custom modular carpet tile do not differ materially from those for off-the-shelf inventory.
 
Our global manufacturing capabilities in modular carpet production are an important component of our strength in these areas, and give us an advantage in serving the needs of multinational corporate customers that require products and services at various locations around the world. Our manufacturing locations across four continents enable us to compete effectively with local producers in our international markets, while giving international customers more favorable delivery times and freight costs.
 
Recognized Global Leadership in Ecological Sustainability. Our long-standing goal and commitment to be ecologically “sustainable” — that is, the point at which we are no longer a net “taker” from the earth and do no harm to the biosphere — have emerged as a competitive strength for our business and remain a strategic initiative. It includes Mission Zero®, our global branding initiative, which represents our mission to eliminate any negative impact our companies may have on the environment by the year 2020. It also includes a bold new mission called Climate Take Back™, in which we seek to lead the industry in designing and making products in ways that will maintain a climate fit for life. Our acknowledged leadership position and expertise in this area resonate deeply with many of our customers and prospects around the globe, and provide us with a differentiating advantage in competing for business among architects, designers and end users of our products, who often make purchase decisions based on “green” factors.
 
Experienced and Motivated Management and Sales Force.  An important component of our competitive position is the quality of our management team and its commitment to developing and maintaining an engaged and accountable workforce. Our team is highly skilled and dedicated to guiding our overall growth and expansion into our targeted market segments, while maintaining our leadership in traditional markets and our high contribution margins. We utilize an internal marketing and predominantly commissioned sales force of more than 950 experienced personnel, stationed at over 70 locations in over 30 countries, to market our products and services in person to our customers. Our incentive compensation and our sales and marketing training programs are tailored to promote performance and facilitate leadership by our executives both in strategic areas as well as the Company as a whole.

Our Business Strategy and Principal Initiatives
 
Our business strategy is to continue to use our leading position in modular carpet and our product design and global made-to-order capabilities as a platform from which to drive acceptance of our modular carpet, new LVT products and new rubber flooring products across several industry segments, while maintaining our leadership position for modular carpet in the corporate office market segment. These efforts generally are described in the following strategic pillars:

• | Grow our core carpet tile business; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Develop a substantial resilient flooring business, which includes our nora rubber products; 
• | Execute supply chain productivity; 
• | Optimize selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) spending; and 
• | Lead a world-changing sustainability movement centered around Mission Zero and Climate Take Back.

 
We will seek to increase revenues and profitability by capitalizing on the above strengths and pursuing the following key initiatives.
 
Penetrate Expanding Geographic Markets for Modular Products. The popularity of modular carpet continues to increase compared with other floorcovering products across most markets, internationally as well as in the United States. While maintaining our leadership in the corporate office segment, we will continue to build upon our position as the worldwide leader for modular carpet in order to promote sales in all market segments globally. A principal part of our international focus – which utilizes our global marketing capabilities and sales infrastructure – is the significant opportunities in several emerging geographic markets for modular carpet. These emerging markets, such as China, India and Eastern Europe, represent large and growing economies and opportunities for Interface to leverage its brand, experience and skills. Other expanding geographic markets, such as Germany and Italy, are established markets that are transitioning to the use of modular carpet from historically low levels of penetration. Each of these geographic markets represents a significant growth opportunity for our modular carpet business.
Continue to Penetrate Non-Corporate Office Market Segments. We will continue our strategic focus on product design and marketing and sales efforts for non-corporate office market segments such as government, education, healthcare, hospitality, retail and residential space. We began this initiative as part of a market diversification strategy to reduce our exposure to the economic cyclicality of the corporate office segment, and it has become a principal strategy generally for growing our business and enhancing profitability. To implement this strategy, we introduced specialized product offerings tailored to the unique demands of these segments and created targeted selling techniques dedicated to penetrating certain segments.
 
As part of this strategy, our FLOR line of products focuses on the U.S. residential carpet and rugs market segment. These products were specifically created to bring high style modular carpet and rugs to the North American residential market. Historically, we offered FLOR in three primary sales channels – catalogs, the Internet, and in our FLOR retail stores.  In the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted a restructuring plan that included the closure of FLOR’s headquarters office and most retail FLOR stores. In 2017, we completed our restructuring plan and now FLOR focuses on internet sales as well as crossover sales by our commercial sales force.
 
Develop a Substantial Resilient Flooring Business. Building upon the success of our initial introduction of products into the high growth LVT market, we plan to expand our LVT product offering while also seeking to introduce new products in the resilient flooring category. We believe our ability to offer and sell our soft and hard surfaces in an integrated flooring design helps meet the needs of our customers by complementing and enhancing our carpet tile portfolio with true modular installation, no transition strips between surfaces, same sizes of carpet tile and LVT products, and favorable acoustic properties. Our acquisition of nora, with its rubber flooring business, is a key component of our strategy in this area.
Continue to Minimize Expenses and Invest Strategically. We have steadily trimmed costs from our operations for several years through multiple initiatives, which have made our cost structure more efficient today and for the future. Our supply chain and other cost containment initiatives have improved our cost structure and yielded operating efficiencies. While we still seek to minimize our expenses in order to increase profitability, we will also take advantage of strategic opportunities to invest in systems, processes and personnel that can help us grow our business and increase profitability and value.
Use Strong Free Cash Flow Generation to Strengthen Our Balance Sheet. Our principal business has been structured to yield contribution margins that generate strong free cash flow (by which we mean cash available to invest back into the business, apply towards servicing debt, potential stock repurchases, strategic acquisitions and the like). Our historical investments in global manufacturing capabilities, facilities and product customization techniques, which we have maintained, also contribute to our ability to generate strong levels of free cash flow. We expect to use our strong free cash flow generation capability to potentially repurchase shares and strengthen our financial position, or re-invest in our operations. We will also continue to execute programs to reduce costs further and enhance free cash flow.  In addition, our existing capacity to increase production levels without significant capital expenditures will further enhance our generation of free cash flow as demand for our products rises.
 
 5


Sustain Leadership in Product Design and Development. As discussed above, our leadership position for product design and development is a competitive advantage and key strength. Our plank, Skinny Plank, and i2 products and TacTiles installation system have confirmed our position as an innovation leader in modular carpet. We will continue initiatives to sustain, augment and capitalize upon that strength to continue to increase our market share in targeted market segments. Our Mission Zero and Climate Take Back initiatives, which draw upon and promote our ecological sustainability commitment, are part of those initiatives and include placing our Mission Zero and Climate Take Back logos on many of our marketing and merchandising materials distributed throughout the world.
 
Challenges
 
In order to capitalize on our strengths and to implement successfully our business strategy and the principal initiatives discussed above, we will have to handle successfully several challenges that confront us or that affect our industry in general. As discussed in the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report, several factors could make it difficult for us, including:

• | sales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by adverse economic cycles in the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | success of the nora acquisition will depend substantially on our ability to realize the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the businesses of the Company and nora, and nora may not contribute to the revenue and profitability of the combined business as much as we expect; 
• | we compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive commercial floorcovering products market, and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do; 
• | our success depends significantly upon the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management executives and our principal design consultant, and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely; 
• | our substantial international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results; 
• | large increases in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers; 
• | unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third party suppliers of synthetic fiber or our sole third party supplier for LVT could have a material adverse effect on us; 
• | we have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could have important negative consequences to us; and 
• | some of our competitors who have greater financial resources than we do are adding manufacturing capacity into the industry throughout the world, which could increase the amount of supply in the market, adversely affect pricing in the market, and generate other competitive factors which could adversely impact our sales and profitability.

 
We believe our business model is strong enough, and our strategic initiatives are properly calibrated, for us to handle these and other challenges we will encounter in our business.
 
Seasonality
 
Historically, our first quarter has typically been our slowest quarter while our fourth quarter has typically been our best quarter, with sales generally increasing throughout the course of the fiscal year.  However, in recent years, as our sales efforts and results in the education market segment (which has a heavy buying season in the summer months) have increased and currency fluctuations have impacted us, our third quarter sales have sometimes been the highest.
Our Products and Services
 
Modular Carpet
 
Interface is the world’s largest manufacturer and marketer of modular carpet. Our modular carpet system, which is marketed under the established global brands Interface and FLOR, utilizes carpet tiles cut in precise, dimensionally stable squares (usually 50 cm x 50 cm) or rectangles (such as planks and Skinny Planks) to produce a floorcovering that combines the appearance and texture of traditional soft floorcovering with the advantages of a modular carpet system. Our GlasBac® technology employs a fiberglass-reinforced polymeric composite backing that provides dimensional stability and reduces the need for adhesives or fasteners. We also make carpet tiles with a backing containing post-industrial and/or post-consumer recycled materials, which we market under the GlasBacRE brand. In addition, we make carpet tile with yarn containing varying degrees of post-consumer nylon, depending on the style and color.

Our carpet tile has become popular for a number of reasons. Carpet tile incorporating our reinforced backing may be easily removed and replaced, permitting rearrangement of furniture without the inconvenience and expense associated with removing, replacing or repairing other soft surface flooring products, including broadloom carpeting. Because a relatively small portion of a carpet installation often receives the bulk of traffic and wear, the ability to rotate carpet tiles between high traffic and low traffic areas and to selectively replace worn tiles can significantly increase the average life and cost efficiency of the floorcovering. In addition, carpet tile facilitates access to sub-floor air delivery systems and telephone, electrical, computer and other wiring by lessening disruption of operations. It also eliminates the cumulative damage and unsightly appearance commonly associated with frequent cutting of conventional carpet as utility connections and disconnections are made. We believe that, within the overall floorcovering market, the worldwide demand for modular carpet is increasing as more customers recognize these advantages.
 
We use a number of conventional and technologically advanced methods of carpet construction to produce carpet tiles in a wide variety of colors, patterns, textures, pile heights and densities. These varieties are designed to meet both the practical and aesthetic needs of a broad spectrum of commercial interiors – particularly offices, healthcare facilities, airports, educational and other institutions, hospitality spaces, and retail facilities – and residential interiors. Our carpet tile systems permit distinctive styling and patterning that can be used to complement interior designs, to set off areas for particular purposes and to convey graphic information. While we continue to manufacture and sell a substantial portion of our carpet tile in standard styles, most of our modular carpet sales in the Americas and Asia-Pacific are custom or made-to-order products designed to meet customer specifications.
 
In addition to general uses of our carpet tile, we produce and sell a specially adapted version of our carpet tile for the healthcare facilities market. Our carpet tile possesses characteristics — such as the use of the Intersept® antimicrobial, static-controlling nylon yarns, and thermally pigmented, colorfast yarns — which make it suitable for use in these facilities in place of hard surface flooring. Moreover, we launched our FLOR line of products to specifically target modular carpet sales to the residential market segment. We also have created modular carpet products specifically designed for each of the education, hospitality and retail market segments.
 
We also manufacture and sell two-meter roll goods that are structure-backed and offer many of the advantages of both carpet tile and broadloom carpet. These roll goods are often used in conjunction with carpet tiles to create special design effects. Our current principal customers for these products are in the education, healthcare and government market segments.
 
Modular Resilient Flooring
 
In 2016, we began offering a category of products we call modular resilient flooring, and our first product introductions into this category were LVT products in a four-city test market in the U.S. We recognize that our customers are buying multiple flooring types to service individual projects, while also looking to partner with fewer suppliers that can offer more products and services. Expanding our product portfolio to include modular resilient flooring, and specifically LVT, allows us to meet this growing demand and pursue new or incremental sales opportunities. LVT also shares many of the same attributes and benefits with carpet tile, and we were able to leverage our experience in modular carpet tile in designing a product specification to meet our aesthetic and performance standards. We also selected a reputable third party to manufacture the products to our specifications, thus allowing us to enter the product category with minimal capital commitments.
 
In 2017, we launched our LVT products globally, beginning with the Level Set™ Collection which includes 41 styles of tiles with printed top layers in a variety of aesthetic looks, including natural woodgrains and stones, textured woodgrains, and patterns. These products are modular and come in sizes that match certain of our modular carpet planks and squares. They also are engineered to the same height as our modular carpet, which means better coverage of irregularities in the sub-floor, lower sound transference from floor to floor, and the ability to install our LVT and modular carpet products side by side without transition strips or layering. In addition, the Level Set Collection is constructed with the same type of backing as our carpet tiles.
 
Rubber Flooring
 
    Nora is a global leader in performance flooring and worldwide share leader in the rubber flooring category under the established norament® and noraplan® brands. Nora enhances the Company’s fast growing resilient flooring portfolio. The acquisition is expected to advance the Company’s growth strategy in expanding market segments, particularly in the healthcare, life sciences and education market segments. Rubber flooring is ideal for applications that require hygienic, safe flooring with strong chemical resistance. Rubber flooring is extremely durable compared to other flooring alternatives.

Other Products and Services
 
We sell a proprietary antimicrobial chemical compound under the registered trademark Intersept that we incorporate in some of our modular carpet products and have licensed to another company for use in air filters. We also sell our TacTiles carpet tile installation system, along with a variety of traditional adhesives and products for carpet installation and maintenance that are manufactured by a third party.  We also continue to provide “turnkey” project management services for national accounts and other large customers through our InterfaceSERVICES™ business. 
 
Marketing and Sales
 
We distribute our products through two primary channels: (1) direct sales to end users; and (2) indirect sales through independent contractors or distributors.  We have traditionally focused our carpet marketing strategy on major accounts, seeking to build lasting relationships with national and multinational end-users, and on architects, engineers, interior designers, contracting firms, and other specifiers who often make or significantly influence purchasing decisions. While most of our sales are in the corporate office segment, both new construction and renovation, we also emphasize sales in other segments, including retail space, government institutions, schools, healthcare facilities, tenant improvement space, hospitality centers, residences and home office space. Our marketing efforts are enhanced by the established and well-known brand names of our carpet products, including Interface and FLOR, as well as the strength of the nora rubber flooring brands of norament® and noraplan®.

An important part of our marketing and sales efforts involves the preparation of custom-made samples of requested carpet designs, in conjunction with the development of innovative product designs and styles to meet the customer’s particular needs. In most cases, we can produce samples to customer specifications in less than five days, which significantly enhances our marketing and sales efforts and has increased our volume of higher margin custom or made-to-order sales. In addition, through our websites, we have made it easy to view and request samples of our products. We also use technology which allows us to provide digital, simulated samples of our products, which helps reduce raw material and energy consumption associated with our samples.
 
We primarily use our internal marketing and sales force to market our carpet products. In order to implement our global marketing efforts, we have product showrooms or design studios in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, India, Australia, Norway, United Arab Emirates, Russia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, China and elsewhere. We expect to open offices in other locations around the world as necessary to capitalize on emerging marketing opportunities.
 
Manufacturing
 
We manufacture carpet at two locations in the United States and at facilities in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Thailand, China and Australia. We manufacture rubber flooring in Germany.
 
Having foreign manufacturing operations enables us to supply our customers with carpet from the location offering the most advantageous delivery times, duties and tariffs, exchange rates, and freight expense, and enhances our ability to develop a strong local presence in foreign markets. We believe that the ability to offer consistent products and services on a worldwide basis at attractive prices is an important competitive advantage in servicing multinational customers seeking global supply relationships. We will consider additional locations for manufacturing operations in other parts of the world as necessary to meet the demands of customers in international markets. For our rubber production we have one manufacturing facility, but we have regional warehouses to achieve advantageous delivery times and optimal freight costs.
 
Our raw materials are generally available from multiple sources – both regionally and globally – with the exception of synthetic fiber (nylon yarn).  For yarn, we principally rely upon two major global suppliers, but we also have significant relationships with at least two other suppliers.  Although our number of principal yarn suppliers is limited, we do have the capability to manufacture carpet using face fiber produced from two separate polymer feedstocks – nylon 6 and nylon 6,6 – which provides additional flexibility with respect to yarn supply inputs, if needed.  Our global sourcing strategy, including with respect to our principal yarn suppliers and dual polymer manufacturing capability, allows us to help guard against any potential shortages of raw materials or raw material suppliers in a specific polymer supply chain. For rubber flooring, the key polymer raw materials are available from multiple sources and we can source both synthetic and natural rubbers depending on product specification and material availability.

We have a flexible-inputs carpet backing line, which we call “Cool Blue™”, at our modular carpet manufacturing facility in LaGrange, Georgia. Using next generation thermoplastic technology, the custom-designed backing line dramatically improves our ability to keep reclaimed and waste carpet in the production “technical loop,” and further permits us to explore other plastics and polymers as inputs. We also have technology that more cleanly separates the face fiber and backing of reclaimed and waste carpet, thus making it easier to recycle some of its components and providing a purer supply of inputs for the Cool Blue process. This technology, which is part of our ReEntry®2.0 carpet reclamation program, allows us to send some of the reclaimed face fiber back to our fiber supplier to be blended with virgin or other post-industrial materials and extruded into new fiber.
 
The environmental management systems of our floorcovering manufacturing facilities in LaGrange, Georgia, West Point, Georgia, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, Thailand, China and Australia are certified under International Standards Organization (ISO) Standard No. 14001. Nora’s manufacturing facility, which is located in Weinheim, Germany, is ISO14001 certified as well and sells the majority of its products with the Blauer Engel label. Blauer Engel is the leading German institute that recognizes products that have environmentally friendly aspects.
 
Our significant international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including risks of restrictive taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, changing political conditions and governmental regulations. We also receive a substantial portion of our revenues in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which makes us subject to the risks inherent in currency translations. Although our ability to manufacture and ship products from facilities in several foreign countries reduces the risks of foreign currency fluctuations we might otherwise experience, we also engage from time to time in hedging programs intended to further reduce those risks.
 
Competition
 
We compete, on a global basis, in the sale of our modular carpet products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of vinyl and other types of floorcoverings, including broadloom carpet. Although the industry has experienced significant consolidation, a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry. We believe we are the largest manufacturer of modular carpet in the world. However, a number of domestic and foreign competitors manufacture modular carpet as one segment of their business, and some of these competitors have financial resources greater than ours. In addition, some of the competing carpet manufacturers have the ability to extrude at least some of their requirements for fiber used in carpet products, which decreases their dependence on third party suppliers of fiber.
 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our primary floorcovering markets are brand recognition, quality, design, service, broad product lines, product performance, marketing strategy and pricing. In the corporate office market segment, modular carpet competes with various floorcoverings, of which broadloom carpet is the most common. We believe the quality, service, design, better and longer average product performance, flexibility (design options, selective rotation or replacement, use in combination with our LVT or roll goods) and convenience of our modular carpet are our principal competitive advantages.
 
We believe we have competitive advantages in several other areas as well. First, having both an internal design staff as well as our relationship with David Oakey Designs allows us to introduce numerous innovative and attractive carpet tile and LVT products to our customers. Additionally, we believe that our global carpet tile manufacturing capabilities are an important competitive advantage in serving the needs of multinational corporate customers. We believe that the incorporation of the Intersept antimicrobial chemical agent into the backing of some modular carpet products enhances our ability to compete successfully across all of our market segments generally, and specifically with resilient tile in the healthcare market.
 
In addition, we believe that our environmental sustainability goals and commitment to eliminate our negative impact on the environment by 2020 is a brand-enhancing, competitive strength as well as a strategic initiative. Our customers are concerned about the environmental and broader ecological implications of their operations and the products they use in them. Our leadership, knowledge and expertise in the area, especially in the “green building” movement and related environmental certification programs, resonate deeply with many of our customers and prospects around the globe. Our modular carpet products historically have had inherent installation and maintenance advantages that translated into greater efficiency and waste reduction. We are using raw materials and production technologies, such as our Cool Blue backing line and our ReEntry 2.0 reclaimed carpet separation process, that directly reduce the adverse impact of those operations on the environment and limit our dependence on petrochemicals.
 
Product Design, Research and Development
 
We maintain an active research, development and design staff of approximately 80 people and also draw on the research and development efforts of our suppliers, particularly in the areas of fibers, yarns and modular carpet backing materials.
 
Our research and development team provides technical support and advanced materials research and development for us. The team assisted in the development of our post-consumer recycled content, polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, extruded sheet process that has been incorporated into our GlasBacRE modular carpet backing. Our post-consumer recycled content PVC extruded sheet exemplifies our commitment to “closing-the-loop” in recycling. More recently, this team developed our TacTiles carpet tile installation system, which uses small squares of adhesive plastic film to connect intersecting carpet tiles. The team also helped implement our Cool Blue flexible inputs backing line and our ReEntry 2.0 reclaimed carpet separation technology and post-consumer recycling technology for nylon face fibers. With a goal of supporting sustainable product designs in floorcoverings applications, we continue to evaluate bio-based and renewable polymers for use in our products. Our research and development team also supports the dissemination, consultancies and technical communication of our global sustainability endeavors. This team also provides all biochemical and technical support to Intersept antimicrobial chemical product initiatives.

Innovation and increased customization in product design and styling are the principal focus of our product development efforts, and this focus has led to several design breakthroughs such as our plank and Skinny Plank products, as well as our i2 product line. Our carpet design and development team is recognized as an industry leader in carpet design and product engineering for the commercial and institutional markets.
 
For nora rubber flooring, the innovation focus is on performance and design. A recent revolutionary innovation is the fast growing self-adhesive nTx solution for nora tiles and sheet goods. Recent step changes in design are noraplan Iona introducing a rubber on rubber print, noraplan valua introducing natural woodlike colors and embossing, and noraplan unita that incorporates real granite parts in a rubber floor. The combination of performance and design makes nora the recognized market leader in rubber flooring.
 
David Oakey Designs provides carpet design and consulting services to us pursuant to a consulting agreement, and this firm augments our internal research, development and design staff. David Oakey Designs’ services under the agreement include creating commercial carpet designs for use by our modular carpet businesses throughout the world, and overseeing product development, design and coloration functions for our modular carpet business in North America. The agreement can be terminated by either party upon six months prior written notice to the other party. David Oakey Designs also contributed to our ability to efficiently produce many products from a single yarn system. Our mass customization production approach evolved, in major part, from this concept and increases the number and variety of product designs, which in turn enables us to offer products with competitive margins.
 
Environmental Initiatives
 
In the latter part of 1994, we commenced a sustainability strategy within our business that we now call Mission Zero, aimed at reducing waste, environmental footprint and costs. Mission Zero, which includes our QUEST waste reduction initiative, is directed towards the elimination of energy and raw materials waste in our businesses, and, on a broader and more long-term scale, the practical reclamation — and ultimate restoration — of shared environmental resources.
 
We have engaged some of the world’s leading authorities on global ecology as environmental advisors. The list of advisors includes: Paul Hawken, author of The Ecology of Commerce: A Declaration of Sustainability and The Next Economy, and co-author of Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution; Amory Lovins, energy consultant and co-founder of the Rocky Mountain Institute; Bill Browning, fellow and former director of the Rocky Mountain Institute’s Green Development Services; Janine M.

As more customers in our target markets share our view that sustainability is an important factor in making purchasing and design decisions, and not just good deeds, our acknowledged leadership position should strengthen our brands and provide a differentiated advantage in competing for business. To further raise awareness of our goal of becoming sustainable, we launched our Mission Zero global branding initiative, which represents our mission to eliminate any negative impact our companies may have on the environment by the year 2020. In 2016, we launched the Climate Take Back initiative, in which we seek to lead industry in designing and making products in ways that will maintain a climate fit for life. Our Mission Zero and Climate Take Back logos appear on many of our marketing and merchandising materials distributed throughout the world.
 
A high point in our pursuit of sustainability has been our creation with the Zoological Society of London of a program called Net-Works® in which we’ve worked with communities in the Philippines to collect discarded fishing nets that are damaging a large coral reef, and divert them to our yarn supplier where they are recycled into new carpet fiber. Net-Works provides a source of income for members of these communities in the Philippines, while also cleaning up the beaches and waters where they live and work. Our Net Effect Collection of carpet tile products, among others, contains yarn that is partly made from the recycled fishing nets collected through the Net-Works program. Net-Works is a big step in redesigning our supply chain from a linear take-make-waste process toward a closed loop system, and it advances our ultimate goal of becoming a restorative enterprise.

Backlog
 
Our backlog of unshipped orders was approximately $190.4 million at February 10, 2019, compared with approximately $122.9 million at February 11, 2018. The 2019 backlog includes backlog for our acquired nora business. Historically, backlog is subject to significant fluctuations due to the timing of orders for individual large projects and currency fluctuations. All of the backlog orders at February 10, 2019 are expected to be shipped during the succeeding six to nine months.
Patents and Trademarks
 
We own numerous patents in the United States and abroad on floorcovering products and on manufacturing processes. The duration of United States patents is between 14 and 20 years from the date of filing of a patent application or issuance of the patent; the duration of patents issued in other countries varies from country to country. We maintain an active patent and trade secret program in order to protect our proprietary technology, know-how and trade secrets. Although we consider our patents to be very valuable assets, we consider our know-how and technology even more important to our current business than patents, and, accordingly, believe that expiration of existing patents or non-issuance of patents under pending applications would not have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
We also own many trademarks in the United States and abroad. In addition to the United States, the primary jurisdictions in which we have registered our trademarks are the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and various countries in Central America, South America and Asia. Some of our more prominent registered trademarks include: Interface, FLOR, Intersept, GlasBac, Mission Zero, norament, noraplan, nTX solution, noraplan unita, noraplan valua and Net-Works.  Trademark registrations in the United States are valid for a period of 10 years and are renewable for additional 10-year periods as long as the mark remains in actual use. The duration of trademarks registered in other jurisdictions varies.
 
Financial Information by Operating Segments and Geographic Areas
 
The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this Report set forth information concerning our sales and long-lived assets by geographic areas, which are also our operating segments. We have only one reporting segment.
Employees
 
At December 30, 2018, we employed a total of 4,094 employees worldwide, of such total 1,688 were clerical, staff, sales, supervisory and management personnel and 2,406 were manufacturing personnel. The worldwide employee total includes 1,066 from the nora acquisition. We also utilized the services of 415 temporary personnel as of December 30, 2018.
 
Some of our production employees in Australia and the United Kingdom are represented by unions. In the Netherlands, a Works Council, the members of which are Interface employees, is required to be consulted by management with respect to certain matters relating to our operations in that country, such as a change in control of Interface Europe B.V. (our modular carpet subsidiary based in the Netherlands), and the approval of the Council is required for some of our actions, including changes in compensation scales or employee benefits. The majority of our employees in Germany are members of a Works Council as well. Our management believes that its relations with the Works Councils, the unions and all of our employees are good.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. The costs of complying with environmental protection laws and regulations have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in the past and are not expected to have a material adverse impact in the future. The environmental management systems of our floorcovering manufacturing facilities in LaGrange, Georgia, West Point, Georgia, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, Thailand, China, Germany and Australia are certified under ISO Standard No. 14001.
