ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
Beyond Meat is a leading plant-based meat company offering a portfolio of revolutionary plant-based meats. We build meat directly from plants, an innovation that enables consumers to experience the taste, texture and other sensory attributes of popular animal-based meat products while enjoying the nutritional and environmental benefits of eating our plant-based meat products. Our brand promise, “Eat What You Love,” represents a strong belief that there is a better way to feed our future and that the positive choices we all make, no matter how small, can have a great impact on our personal health and the health of our planet. By shifting from animal-based meat to plant-based meat, we can positively impact four growing global issues: human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources and animal welfare. The success of our breakthrough innovation model and products has allowed us to appeal to a broad range of consumers, including flexitarians, those who typically eat animal-based meats, positioning us to compete directly in the $1.4 trillion global meat industry.
To capture this broad market opportunity, we have developed three core plant-based product platforms that align with the largest meat categories globally: beef, pork and poultry. The primary components of animal-based meat—amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, trace minerals and water—are not exclusive to animals and are plentiful in plants. We create our plant-based products using proprietary scientific processes that determine the architecture of the animal-based meat we are seeking to replicate and then we assemble it using plant-derived amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, trace minerals and water. We are focused on continuously improving our products so that eventually they are, to the human sensory system, indistinguishable from their animal-based counterparts.
Our flagship product is the Beyond Burger, designed to look, cook and taste like a traditional beef burger. We also sell a range of other plant-based meat products, including Beyond Sausage, Beyond Beef, Beyond Meatballs, Beyond Breakfast Sausage Patties, Beyond Breakfast Sausage Links, Beyond Beef Crumbles, Beyond Italian Sausage Crumbles, Beyond Chicken Tenders, Beyond Steak, Beyond Popcorn Chicken, Beyond Chicken Nuggets and Beyond Meat Jerky. All of our products are made from simple ingredients without GMOs, no added hormones or antibiotics, and 0 mg of cholesterol per serving. With the exception of certain Beyond Beef Crumbles which are not certified Kosher, all of our products are certified Kosher and Halal. All of our products are good to excellent sources of protein and we are focused on making them nutritionally dense, with minimal negative attributes relative to their animal protein alternatives. As of December 2022, Beyond Meat branded products were available at approximately 190,000 retail and foodservice outlets in more than 80 countries worldwide, across mainstream grocery, mass merchandiser, club store, convenience store and natural retailer channels, and various food-away-from-home channels, including restaurants, foodservice outlets and schools.
Research, development and innovation are core elements of our business strategy, and we believe they represent a critical competitive advantage for us. Through our Beyond Meat Rapid and Relentless Innovation Program, our team of scientists and engineers focuses on making continuous improvements to our existing product formulations and developing new products across our plant-based beef, pork and poultry platforms. Our state-of-the-art Innovation Center within our Campus Headquarters brings together leading scientists from chemistry, biology, material science, food science and biophysics disciplines who work together with process engineers and culinary specialists to pursue our vision of perfectly building plant-based meat.
Net revenues decreased to $418.9 million in 2022 from $464.7 million in 2021, representing a 9.8% reduction. We have generated losses since inception. Net loss in 2022 and 2021 was $366.1 million and $182.1 million, respectively, as we pursued our long-term goal of future growth of our business, investing in innovation, people, infrastructure, product scaling and establishing strategic partnerships in the U.S., EU and China. In 2022, our net revenues were negatively affected by softness in demand in the plant-based category, macroeconomic issues, including inflation, rising interest rates and increasing concerns about the likelihood of a 
recession, and increased competition. Additionally, there remains uncertainty regarding the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain negative impacts on our business, the plant-based category, consumer and customer behavior, and demand levels.
In response to the current difficult environment and the negative impact of these factors on our business and the overall plant-based category, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022 we are pivoting our focus toward sustainable long-term growth supported by three pillars: (1) driving margin recovery and operating expense reduction through the implementation of lean value streams across our beef, pork and poultry platforms; (2) inventory reduction and cash flow generation through more efficient inventory management; and (3) focusing on near-term retail and foodservice growth drivers while supporting strategic key long-term partners and opportunities.
Our Mission
We are a mission-driven business with long-standing core values. We strive to operate in a transparent, socially responsible and environmentally sustainable manner and are committed to help solve the major health and global environmental issues which we believe are caused in part by an animal-based protein diet and existing industrial livestock production. We believe our authentic and long-standing commitment to these causes better positions us to build loyalty and trust with current consumers and helps to attract new ones. Our corporate culture embodies these values and, as a result, we enjoy a highly motivated and skilled workforce committed to our mission and our enterprise.
The Beyond Meat Strategic Difference
•Unique Approach to the Product
We employ a revolutionary and unique approach to create our products, with a goal of delivering the same satisfying taste, aroma and texture as the animal-based meats we seek to replicate. At our Innovation Center within our Campus Headquarters, our scientists and engineers work to continuously improve our products to replicate the sensory experience of animal-based meat. Each product is designed to not only closely replicate the taste and sensory experience of its animal protein equivalent, but to also provide the nutritional and environmental benefits of plant-based meat.
We start by analyzing the composition and design of relevant animal-based meats at the molecular and structural level. The primary components, other than water, comprising animal-based meats are amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates and trace minerals, which are not exclusive to animals and are present in abundance in plants. The amino acids that form the proteins which represent the muscle of animal-based meat can be sourced from plants. We use proteins primarily extracted from yellow peas, as well as mung beans, faba beans, brown rice and other plant stock, through a physical process to separate protein and fiber. We then apply heating, cooling and pressure at rapid and varied intervals to weave the protein into a fibrous structure to create woven protein that mimics the texture of muscle. Our woven protein is converted according to our formulas and specifications into a packaged product at our own facilities or by our network of co-manufacturers, after which the final packaged product is then shipped to distributors or direct to customers.
•Unique Approach to the Market
Our breakthrough product innovations have enabled a paradigm shift in both marketing and target audience—tapping into the enthusiastic pull from mainstream consumers for delicious and satisfying, yet better-for-you plant-based meats. This approach is summed up in our brand promise—“Eat What You Love.” When we launched our flagship Beyond Burger in 2016, we approached the marketplace in an unprecedented way. Instead of marketing and merchandising the Beyond Burger to vegans and vegetarians, we requested that the product be sold in the meat case at grocery retailers where meat-loving consumers are accustomed to shopping for center-of-plate proteins. We believe merchandising in the meat case in the retail channel has helped drive greater brand awareness with our end consumers.
Reflecting the strength and value of the Beyond Meat brand to its partners, many of our foodservice customers choose to prominently feature our brand name on their menu and within item descriptions, in addition to displaying Beyond Meat branded signage throughout their venues. We believe that we have established our brand as one with “halo” benefits to our partners as evidenced by the increased adoption by strategic QSR partners. Our foodservice channel not only functions as a form of paid trial for our products, helping to drive additional retail demand, but also creates even greater brand awareness for Beyond Meat through the on-menu and in-store publicity we receive. 
•Unique Approach to Our Brand
Our mission is to create nutritious plant-based meats that taste delicious and deliver a consumer experience that is indistinguishable from that provided by animal-based meats. We believe our brand promise, “Eat What You Love,” encourages consumers to eat more, not less, of the traditional dishes they enjoy by using our products, while feeling great about the health, sustainability and animal welfare benefits associated with consuming plant-based meat. This approach is one of the reasons all of our current products are non-GMO. Our approach of bringing to market the best innovations is a strategy that engages the consumer and provides feedback from which we iterate and improve. 
Our brand awareness has been driven by strong digital and social media marketing as well as earned media reaching our digitally native target audience. The viral nature of our marketing and brand-building has been enhanced by both the network of brand ambassadors we have developed throughout the United States and abroad, and our strong following by celebrities from the worlds of sports and entertainment who help promote the benefits of a plant-based diet and the Beyond Meat brand.
In 2022 we brought the environmental impact of our products to the forefront, showcasing the difference a burger can make through “This Burger Fights Climate Change,” a nationwide campaign stretching from Times Square billboards to YouTube shorts. We expanded the premise in our summer grilling campaign, joining Kevin Hart as he time-traveled through the decades to help change the world, one delicious Beyond Burger at a time. In October, we supported the launch of three new products, including Beyond Steak, through an omnichannel campaign across traditional and retail media.
Our Industry and Market Opportunity 
We operate in the large and global meat industry, which is comprised of fresh and packaged animal-based meats for human consumption. According to data from Fitch Solutions Macro Research, the meat industry is the largest category in food and in 2017 generated estimated sales across retail and foodservice channels of approximately $270 billion in the United States and approximately $1.4 trillion globally. We believe our revenue growth over time will allow us to capture an increased share of the broader U.S. meat category, supported by a number of key drivers, including the authentic comparability and sensory experience of our products to their animal-based meat equivalents, continued mainstream acceptance of our products by traditional animal-based meat consumers, heightened consumer awareness of the role that food and nutrition, particularly plant-based foods, play in long-term human health and wellness, and growing concerns related to the negative environmental and animal-welfare impacts of animal-based meat consumption. As a market leader in the plant-based meat category, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of and drive this category growth. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following strengths position us to generate growth and pursue our objective to become a leader in the global meat category.
•Dedicated Focus on Innovation 
We invest significant resources in our innovation capabilities to develop plant-based meat alternatives to popular animal-based meat products. Our innovation team, comprised of scientists, engineers, researchers, technicians and chefs, has delivered a number of unique plant-based meat breakthroughs, as well as continuous improvements to existing products. We are able to leverage what we learn about taste, texture, 
aroma and appearance across our plant-based beef, pork and poultry platforms and apply this knowledge to each of our product offerings. In 2022, our innovation team moved into its new location within our Campus Headquarters, where we have a strong pipeline of products in development.
•Brand Mission Aligned with Consumer Trends
We believe our brand is uniquely positioned to capitalize on growing consumer interest in great-tasting, nutritious, convenient, higher protein content and plant-based foods. We have also tapped into growing public awareness of major issues connected to animal protein, including human health, climate change, resource conservation and animal welfare. Simply put, our products aim to enable consumers to “Eat What You Love” without the downsides associated with conventional animal protein. 
We have built a powerful brand with broad demographic appeal and a passionate consumer base. Our brand awareness is driven by strong marketing. Our audience continues to grow from the attention generated by our large following of celebrities, influencers and brand ambassadors who identify with our mission.
•Product Portfolio Generates Demand Across Channels
Increased sales of our products have helped us foster strong relationships in a relatively short period of time. We provide our retailers with exciting new products in the meat case, where innovation rarely occurs. 
Our foodservice customers are excited by the opportunity to differentiate their menu offerings and attract new customers by partnering with Beyond Meat, and are seeking new ways to further promote our products, for example through mass media advertising campaigns inclusive of TV, radio, out of home and digital channels. We believe our customers’ frequent choice to feature Beyond Meat demonstrates the marketing power of our brand and overall consumer excitement for our products. This type of demand for our products has been a driving force in building strong ties with customers who have been continually impressed by the impact our brand can make on their business.
•Experienced and Passionate Executive Management Team
We are led by a proven and experienced executive management team with broad industry experience, including at both consumer packaged goods companies and high-growth businesses. Prior to founding Beyond Meat, Ethan Brown, our President and Chief Executive Officer, spent over a decade in the clean energy industry working for hydrogen fuel cell leader, Ballard Power Systems, rising from an entry level manager to reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Brown’s significant experience in clean tech, coupled with an appreciation of animal agriculture's role in contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, led him to start a plant-based meat products company. Our executive management team plays an integral role in Beyond Meat’s success by instilling a culture committed to innovation, customer satisfaction and growth.
Cost Down Strategy
A key component of our business strategy is to continually drive the cost of our products down over time, with the aspiration to eventually price at parity with animal-based protein. To enable this, in 2021 we kicked off our Cost Down program, which consists of multiple workstreams focused on initiatives such as competitive bidding for ingredients, increasing manufacturing throughput, streamlining our internal fulfillment network and reformulating products to reduce costs. The reductions in force implemented in August and October 2022 and our sharpened focus on certain large customers and markets, are examples of ways we’ve started executing on our broader cost down strategy.
Our Long-Term Growth Strategy
In response to the current difficult environment and the negative impact of certain factors on our business and the overall plant-based category, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022 we are pivoting our focus toward sustainable long-term growth supported by three pillars: (1) driving margin recovery and operating expense reduction through the implementation of lean value streams across our beef, pork and poultry platforms; (2) 
inventory reduction and cash flow generation through more efficient inventory management; and (3) focusing on near-term retail and foodservice growth drivers while supporting strategic key long-term partners and opportunities. For clarity, lean value streams represent organizing our teams and operational approach in such a way that increases cross-functional collaboration, transparency and ownership of key business processes and initiatives, with an overarching objective of eliminating waste throughout our organization. We believe, if implemented effectively, the use of a lean value stream approach could drive faster speed-to-market of new product launches, which in turn could accelerate our sales growth, increase our pace of reducing our production costs and expanding our gross margin, and enable further operating expense reductions, among others.
In the long-term, we intend to continue to do the following:
•Pursue Top-line Growth Across our Distribution Channels
We continue to believe that there is a significant opportunity over time to expand our retail and foodservice footprint through distribution expansion, continued innovation and commercialization of new products, increased penetration across channels and into other areas of the retail footprint. We believe increased distribution will lead to growing consumer awareness and demand for nutritious, convenient and high protein plant-based foods, leading to an increase in the overall size of the plant-based meat category as more consumers shift their diets away from animal-based proteins.
•Invest in Infrastructure and Capabilities
Over the long-term, we are committed to prioritizing investment in our infrastructure and capabilities. In 2022, we made significant investments in support of our production and supply chain capabilities, new Campus Headquarters, sales and marketing efforts, our joint venture, TPP, and the bolstering of our IT and systems infrastructure in order to enable a sustainable market-leading position for the long-term.
We are continually reviewing opportunities to optimize our manufacturing capacity across our network, identifying opportunities to increase overall equipment effectiveness, as well as opportunities to leverage our internal manufacturing and co-manufacturer network. 
•Expand Our Product Offerings
The success of our products over the past several years supports our belief that, despite a recent softness in the plant-based category, there will continue to be significant demand for additional plant-based meat products in the long-term. We intend to strengthen our product offerings by improving the formulations for our existing portfolio of products and by creating new products that expand the portfolio. We are continually refining our products to improve their taste, texture, aroma and appearance. In addition, we are committed to investing in research and development to continue to innovate within our core plant-based platforms of beef, pork and poultry to create exciting new product lines and improve the formulations for our existing portfolio of products. 
Our new product launches in 2022 included the launch of Beyond Steak, Beyond Chicken Nuggets and Beyond Popcorn Chicken in U.S. retail and foodservice channels, tests of Beyond Carne Asada and Beyond Fried Chicken in the U.S. foodservice channel, Beyond Italian Sausage Crumbles in the Canadian foodservice channel, and Beyond Dumplings and Beyond Meat Plant-based Pork Patties in China e-commerce channels.
•Continue to Grow Our Brand
We intend to continue to develop our brand and increase awareness of Beyond Meat. We plan on highlighting our “Go Beyond” message and the global benefits that come with eating our products. We also plan to continue to create relevant content with our network of celebrities, influencers and brand ambassadors, who have successfully built significant brand awareness for us by supporting our mission and products and incorporating Beyond Meat into their daily lifestyle. We also intend to resume and expand our pre-COVID-19 field marketing efforts to sample products directly with consumers in stores and at relevant events. 
Our Products
We sell a range of plant-based meat products across our three core platforms of beef, pork and poultry. Depending on the product and channel, they are offered in ready-to-cook, ready-to-heat or shelf-stable formats. Our products cover an entire day’s menu planning, from breakfast to dinner and snacking in between.
All of our products are made from simple ingredients without GMOs, no added hormones or antibiotics, and 0 mg of cholesterol per serving. With the exception of certain Beyond Beef Crumbles which are not certified Kosher, all of our products are certified Kosher and Halal. All of our products are good to excellent sources of protein and we are focused on making them nutritionally dense, with lower negative attributes relative to their animal protein alternatives.
Our beef platform consists of our line of products that are intended to mimic animal-based beef in its various merchandised forms, including ground beef, burger patties and meatballs, among others. Our primary products under our beef platform include the Beyond Burger, Beyond Beef, Beyond Meatballs, Beyond Beef Crumbles, Beyond Meat Jerky and Beyond Steak which are sold across our U.S. and international retail and foodservice channels. The protein content for our beef platform products is primarily derived from one or a combination of pea protein, rice protein, faba bean protein, wheat gluten and mung bean protein.
Our pork platform consists of our line of products that are intended to mimic animal-based pork in its various merchandised forms, including dinner sausage links, breakfast sausage patties and links, and ground pork, among others. Our primary products under our pork platform include Beyond Sausage, Beyond Breakfast Sausage Patties, Beyond Breakfast Sausage Links, Beyond Sausage Crumbles and Beyond Ground Pork, and are sold across our U.S. and international retail and foodservice channels. The protein content of our pork platform products is primarily derived from one or a combination of pea protein, rice protein and soy protein.
Our poultry platform consists of our line of products that are intended to mimic animal-based chicken in its various merchandised forms, including chicken tenders, chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken. Our primary products under our poultry platform include Beyond Chicken Tenders, Beyond Chicken Nuggets and Beyond Popcorn Chicken. With the exception of Beyond Chicken Tenders, which is sold across our U.S. and international retail and foodservice channels, the poultry platform products are primarily sold in our U.S. retail channel. The protein content for our poultry platform products is primarily derived from faba bean protein and wheat gluten.
Customers
Since the success of the Beyond Burger, we have created a strong presence at leading food retailers across the United States and abroad. As of December 2022, Beyond Meat branded products were available in approximately 78,000 retail outlets in the United States and 35,000 retail outlets internationally. 
We remain focused on expanding our partnerships with foodservice customers over time, including large full-service restaurant (“FSR”) and QSR customers in the United States and abroad. As of December 2022, Beyond Meat branded products were available in approximately 43,000 foodservice outlets in the United States and 34,000 foodservice outlets internationally.
We sell to a variety of customers in the retail and foodservice channels throughout the United States and internationally primarily through distributors who purchase, store, sell and deliver our products. Because such distributors function in an intermediary role, we do not consider them to be direct customers. In addition, we sell directly to customers in the retail and foodservice channels who handle their own distribution. 
In 2022, DOT Foods, Inc. (“DOT”) accounted for approximately 12% of our gross revenues. In 2021, DOT and Zandbergen WFM accounted for approximately 12% and 11% of our gross revenues, respectively. In 2020, Costco accounted for approximately 13% of our gross revenues. No other distributor or customer accounted for more than 10% of our gross revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020.
Our Supply Chain
•Sourcing and Suppliers
The principal ingredient used to manufacture our products is pea protein. We procure the raw materials for our woven protein from a number of different suppliers. Although most of the raw materials we require are typically readily available from multiple sources, we currently have a limited number of suppliers for the pea protein used in our products. 
•Supply Agreements
We have a multi-year sales agreement with Roquette Frères (“Roquette”) for the supply of pea protein which expires on December 31, 2023. We are obligated to purchase certain minimum annual amounts as specified in the agreement. We continually seek additional sources of pea protein and other plant-based protein for our products that meet our criteria.
Flavors consist of product flavors that have been developed by our innovation team in collaboration with our supply partners exclusively for us or in collaboration with our foodservice partners. The formulas are then produced by our suppliers for use in our products. Ingredients in our flavors are qualified through trials to ensure manufacturability. Upon receipt of the ingredients, we receive Certificates of Analysis from our suppliers in our quality control process to confirm that our rigorous standards have been met. Flavors are extensively tested prior to introduction to ensure finished product attributes such as taste, texture, aroma and appearance are not negatively impacted.
Other than the pea protein supply agreement described above, we generally do not have long-term supply agreements with our other suppliers. As most of the raw materials we use in our flavors are readily available in the market from many suppliers, we believe that we can within a reasonable period of time make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of an interruption of supply from our vendors. 
Manufacturing
As the first step in our manufacturing process a dry blend containing our plant protein is combined within our manufacturing facility. The dry blend then enters our extruder, where both water and steam are added. We then use a combination of heating, cooling and variations of pressure to weave together the proteins into an architecture that mimics the texture and muscle structure of animal meat. The formed woven protein is used as the basis of all our products. Next, internally or through our co-manufacturers, we further process the woven protein by combining flavorings and other ingredients, after which the final packaged product is then shipped to distributors or direct to customers. In order to sustain the quality of our products, we have implemented a “define, measure, analyze, improve and control,” or DMAIC, approach to improve, optimize and stabilize our processes and design.
We depend on co-manufacturers for the manufacturing of some of our products. Our co-manufacturers are currently in various locations throughout the United States, Canada, the Netherlands and China. We continue to explore further optimization of our production capabilities domestically and abroad to produce our woven proteins, blends of flavor systems and binding systems, and finished goods.
Quality Control
In-process quality checks are performed throughout the manufacturing process, including temperature, physical dimensions and weight. We provide specific instructions to customers and consumers for storing and cooking our products. A majority of our products are transported and stored frozen. Frozen products such as Beyond Beef Crumbles and Beyond Breakfast Sausage Patties are intended to be prepared from their frozen state, with cooking instructions enclosed on all packaging.
Retail products sold in the meat case, such as the Beyond Burger, Beyond Sausage, Beyond Beef, Beyond Meatballs and Beyond Sausage Links, are shipped to the customer frozen. The customer is provided instructions on ‘slacking,’ which is typically done by moving frozen food to a refrigerator to allow it to slowly and 
safely thaw before cooking. For this step, retailers must apply a “use by date” sticker to the packaging prior to sale.
Distribution
From our internal manufacturing or co-manufacturing facilities, products are transferred by third-party logistics providers to cold storage facilities or are directly shipped to the customer. International shipments are also handled by third-party logistics providers and in some instances are organized directly by the customer.
At present, we manage shipments through Manhattan Active Transportation Management System (TMS) and FourKites for real-time shipment tracking and visibility to coordinate our supply chain through to final distribution.
Order Fulfillment
Our customer service and logistics functions are responsible for customer-facing activities, order management, customer logistics, 3PL leadership and intra-company distribution. We utilize Oracle NetSuite ERP and integration with our 3PL Cloud interface platforms for these processes. Customer orders are principally transmitted via electronic data interface, or EDI, but may be processed manually if necessary. Orders are accepted in NetSuite, reviewed for accuracy and fulfillment plans are developed. When fulfillment plans are ready, orders are tendered to 3rd party carriers via Manhattan TMS. Metrics for the Customer Service and Logistics team include order fill rates, on-time delivery, customer scorecards as needed and cost leadership. We have agreements with third-party service providers for all of our shipping needs.
Sales and In-Store Activation
•Sales
As of December 31, 2022, our sales team is organized into four divisions: retail, foodservice, international and strategic partnerships. Additionally, we have strong support functions with Category Management, Consumer Insights and Analytics, Customer Service and Marketing. The sales team has an extensive range of experience from leading CPG, natural food, meat and plant-based meat companies. It works in close coordination with a network of global broker and distributor partners that gives us the expertise and access to accounts and markets across key global markets in an efficient and scalable fashion as we continue to seek to grow our footprint and sales globally.
•Brand Marketing 
The primary means by which we have driven consumer awareness of our products is via social and digital media, PR, retail and foodservice shopper marketing, ambassador and influencer activations, paid media and strategic partnerships. Our marketing strategy focuses on driving awareness all the way through to purchase and loyalty. 
We maintain active social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter to build awareness, share news, reach new audiences and engage with our consumers. These platforms allow us to engage with our consumers and directly reach target demographics such as millennials and “Generation Z.” We also leverage our first party data to distribute brand information and news, foster loyalty through unique offers and share recipe content to drive consumption.
We also maintain a registered domain website at www.beyondmeat.com, which serves as the primary source of information regarding our products, as well as foreign domains in certain countries. Our website is used as a platform to promote our products, provide news, share recipes, highlight nutritional facts and provide general information on where to purchase our products. 
We are fortunate to have partnered with a network of brand ambassadors and developed a strong following by celebrities from the worlds of sports and entertainment who share our core values. Their organic involvement and interest are helpful to promote our overall mission and strategic partnerships.
In 2022, we deployed targeted brand campaigns to build awareness, reach new users and drive conversion. Our paid digital initiatives included social, programmatic, podcasts, out-of-home, online video, connected TV, and digital offers and rewards.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment. We believe that we compete with both conventional animal-protein companies, such as Cargill, Hormel, JBS, Perdue Foods, Tyson and WH Group, and also plant-based meat brands, including brands affiliated with conventional animal-protein companies and other large food operators, such as Alpha Foods, Boca Foods (Kraft Heinz), Lightlife and Field Roast Grain Meat Co. (Maple Leaf Foods), Gardein (Conagra), Hungry Planet, Inc., Impossible Foods, Incogmeato/Morningstar Farms (Kellogg), Moving Mountains, Omn!pork (OmniFoods), Tofurky, Sweet Earth and Awesome Burger (Nestle’ S.A.), Pure Farmland by Smithfield Foods (WH Group), Raised & Rooted (Tyson), Happy Little Plants (Hormel), Sysco’s Simply Plant-Based Meatless Burger, Tattooed Chef, The Not Company and Vegetarian Butcher (Unilever). Additionally, a number of U.S. and international companies are working on developing lab-grown or “clean meat,” an animal-protein product cultivated from cells taken from animals, which could have a similar appeal to consumers as plant-based products. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry are:
• taste;
• nutritional profile;
• ingredients;
• texture;
• ease of integration into the consumer diet;
• low-carbohydrate, low-sugar, high fiber and protein;
• lack of cholesterol, gluten and GMOs;
• convenience;
• price and promotion tactics;
• brand awareness and loyalty among consumers;
• media spending;
• product variety and packaging;
• access to major retailer shelf space and retail locations;
• access to major foodservice outlets and integration into menus; 
• innovation; and
• intellectual property protection on products.
We believe we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors. However, many companies in our industry have substantially greater financial resources, more comprehensive product lines, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with distributors and suppliers, longer operating histories, greater production, commercialization and distribution capabilities and greater marketing resources than we have.
Research and Development
Our research and development team creates, tests and refines our products at our Innovation Center within our Campus Headquarters. We employ in-house scientists, engineers, researchers and testers to help create the next iterations of our plant-based meat products. Our team has delivered a number of first-to-market 
breakthroughs focused on plant-based meat and we are also focused on continuous improvement of existing products. We have and will continue to protect any intellectual property created by us.
Our Beyond Meat Rapid and Relentless Innovation Program defines the details of the product innovation process from ideation and prototype development through commercialization. This process assigns responsibility and accountability of each functional team throughout the process and defines deliverables at each step.
Product Innovation
Innovation is a core competency of ours and an important part of our growth strategy. Our goal is to identify large, animal-based meat product categories across our core plant-based platforms of beef, pork and poultry that exhibit long-term consumer trends. We then dedicate significant research and development resources to create authentic plant-based versions of these products that replicate the taste, texture, aroma and appearance of their animal-based equivalents. We have been able to leverage the success of our existing products and resulting brand equity to launch improved versions of our existing products and create new products. 
The innovation team undertakes extensive research projects to increase our fundamental understanding of animal-based meat and plant-based equivalents. A few examples of where we are focusing on continued refinements of our products include: 
• Better fat adipose tissue and saturated fat mimics: We are researching new materials and technologies capable of mimicking saturated fat in terms of texture and appearance, but without the nutritional drawbacks of saturated fat.
• Alternative functional proteins: We pursue new non-animal proteins that add function to our food products, including native proteins that can denature during cooking, protein binders and protein emulsifying agents and proteins.
• Additional connective tissue equivalents: We are seeking materials and methods to introduce additional cartilaginous-like materials and heterogeneity in the form of both texture and appearance in our food products.
• Encapsulation materials and technology: We are seeking new materials and technologies to expand the scope of controlled-release delivery systems in our food products as it relates to delivering flavor, color and texturizing agents.
• Materials and technologies to support flavor and texture development: We are seeking non-GMO enzymes that can assist with protein enzymolysis as it relates to flavor reactions.
On January 25, 2021, we entered into TPP, a joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., to develop, produce and market innovative snack and beverage products made from plant-based protein. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps to restructure certain contracts and operating activities related to Beyond Meat Jerky. Such activities are expected to continue through most of 2023. 
Seasonality
Generally, we expect to experience greater demand for certain of our products during the summer grilling season. In 2022 and 2021, U.S. retail channel net revenues during the second quarter were 16% and 21% higher than the first quarter, respectively. We expect to continue to see additional seasonality effects, especially within our retail channel, with revenue contribution from this channel tending to be greater in the second and third quarters of the year, along with increased levels of purchasing by customers ahead of holidays, the impact of customer shelf reset activity and the timing of product restocking by our retail customers. In addition, in an environment of recessionary and inflationary pressures, general softness in the plant-based category, competition and other factors impacting our business, including uncertainty around the long-term impacts of COVID-19, we are unable to assess the ultimate impact on the demand for our products as a result of seasonality.
Human Capital Resources
•Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 787 full-time employees and 89 contract workers. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. 
•Employee Health and Safety Related to COVID-19
In the United States, we have transitioned back to normal operating procedures with a heightened awareness of maintaining a healthy workplace and work environment. At all of our facilities, we follow current guidelines from local departments of public health and have implemented comprehensive preventative hygienic measures to support the health and safety of our employees.
As a result of China’s lifting of its zero COVID policies, our facilities in China no longer require visitors and personnel to obtain a 72-hour swab test. However, at our R&D center and Jiaxing factory, visitors are still required to pre-register their personal details and record their temperature.

•Diversity and Inclusion
We value the unique talent and merit that derive from diverse backgrounds and experience. We aspire to engender and affirm equity and inclusion through a purposeful investment in qualified individuals from an array of different communities. Our company culture thrives when different perspectives and ideas inform our strategic goals to innovate and deliver to customers of every socio-economic background. We recognize that representation and collaboration are vital components to address the challenges that face our planet. We have developed a framework of guiding principles that set the foundation for sustainable Diversity, Equity and Inclusion practices by reducing subjectivity and biases via data-driven decisions and promoting shared ownership for inclusive behaviors and actions across the organization. In addition, we are actively working on our diversity and inclusion roadmap, which focuses on four pillars: Workplace Inclusion, Employee Experience, Equitable Brand and Community.
•Mission, Culture and Engagement
Everything we do is powered by our mission and core values and our corporate culture reflects that. As a result, we enjoy a highly motivated and skilled workforce committed to our mission and our company. We believe we have a unique culture which promotes employee engagement. Our employees are driven by our mission which promotes collaboration and innovation. We promote employee engagement by organizing various employee activities that are aligned with our mission, including our weekly “Coffee Talk,” a forum for employee engagement with the leadership.
•Total Rewards and Pay Philosophy
We strive to attract and retain diverse, high-caliber employees who raise the talent bar by offering competitive compensation and benefit packages, regardless of their gender identity, race, age, perspective, or other personal characteristics. We regularly review and survey our compensation and benefit programs against the market to ensure we remain competitive in our hiring practices. We provide employee salaries that are competitive and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, the location of their job and their performance.
We also review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable. In addition to our competitive salaries, to enhance our employees’ sense of participation in the company and to further align their interests with those of our stockholders, we offer equity to all of our salaried employees.
We offer a variety of comprehensive medical benefits to our employees. In addition to medical benefits, we offer our employees dental and vision coverage, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, 
paid company holidays, paid parental leave, bereavement leave, pet bereavement leave, employee assistance programs, a 401(k) retirement savings plan with company matching contributions, voluntary short-term and long-term disability insurance, and life insurance.
•Development and Retention
We strive to hire, develop and retain outstanding talent that is passionate about changing the world and that continuously raises the performance bar. We encourage, support and compensate our employees based on our philosophy of recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance. We achieve this by focusing on development, goal setting, accomplishments and ongoing feedback that aligns with short- and long-term company strategy. We believe that development is foundational to future success and should be an ongoing process in which all employees should be active participants.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We own domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Our primary trademarks include Beyond Meat, Beyond Burger, Beyond Beef, Beyond Sausage, Beyond Breakfast Sausage, Beyond Chicken, Beyond Fried Chicken, Beyond Meatball, the Caped Steer Logo, Go Beyond, Eat What You Love, Cookout Classic, The Future of Protein, and The Future of Protein Beyond Meat and design, and are registered or pending trademarks of Beyond Meat, Inc. in the United States and, in some cases, in certain other countries. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brand to our consumers. We have applied for or have trademark registrations internationally as well. We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets are important to our success.
We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws and through the domain name dispute resolution system. We maintain a registered domain website at www.beyondmeat.com, as well as foreign domains in certain countries.
We believe our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to our business. As of December 31, 2022, we had two issued patents in the United States and seven issued patents outside the United States (U.K., Indonesia, Canada, China, Chile, Israel and Australia), two pending patent applications in the United States, eight pending international patent applications and one provisional patent application.
We consider the specifics of our marketing, promotions and products as a trade secret, and information we wish to keep confidential. In addition, we consider proprietary information related to formulas, processes, know-how and methods used in our production and manufacturing as trade secrets, and information we wish to keep confidential. We have taken reasonable measures to keep the above-mentioned items, as well as our business and marketing plans, customer lists and contracts reasonably protected, and they are accordingly not readily ascertainable by the public.
Segments
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by its chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer. We have determined that we operate in one operating segment and one reportable segment, as our CODM reviews financial information presented on an aggregate basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.
Government Regulation
Along with our co-manufacturers, brokers, distributors and ingredients and packaging suppliers, we are subject to extensive laws and regulations in the United States by federal, state and local government authorities and in Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, China and other jurisdictions by foreign authorities. In 
the United States, the primary federal agencies governing the manufacture, distribution, labeling and advertising of our products are the FDA and the FTC, and foreign regulatory authorities include Health Canada or the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (“CFIA”) and the authorities of the EU or the EU member states. Under various federal statutes and implementing regulations and foreign requirements, these agencies, among other things, prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for quality and safety and regulate our product composition, ingredients, manufacturing, labeling and other marketing and advertising to consumers. Among other things, the facilities in which our products and ingredients are manufactured must register with the FDA and any other relevant authorities based on location, comply with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and comply with a range of food safety requirements established by and implemented under the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 and applicable foreign food safety and manufacturing requirements. Federal, state, and foreign regulators have the authority to inspect our facilities to evaluate compliance with applicable requirements. Federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities also require that certain nutrition and product information appear on our product labels and, more generally, that our labels and labeling be truthful and non-misleading and that our marketing and advertising be truthful, non-misleading and not deceptive to consumers. We are also restricted from making certain types of claims about our products, including for example, in the United States, nutrient content claims, health claims, and claims regarding the effects of our products on any structure or function of the body, whether express or implied, unless we satisfy certain regulatory requirements. 
In addition, the United States Congress recently considered (but did not pass) federal legislation, called the Real MEAT Act, that could require changes to our product labeling and marketing, including identifying products as “imitation” meat products. 
In addition to federal regulatory requirements in the United States, certain states impose their own manufacturing and labeling requirements. For example, every state in which our products are manufactured requires facility registration with the relevant state food safety agency, and those facilities are subject to state inspection as well as federal inspection. Further, states can impose state-specific labeling requirements. For example, in 2018, the state of Missouri passed a law that prohibits any person engaged in advertising, offering for sale, or sale of food products from misrepresenting products as meat that are not derived from harvested production livestock or poultry. The state of Missouri Department of Agriculture has clarified its interpretation that products which include prominent disclosure that the product is “made from plants,” or comparable disclosure such as through the use of the phrase “plant-based,” are not misrepresented under Missouri law. Additional states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming, have subsequently passed similar laws, and legislation that would impose specific requirements on the naming of plant-based meat products is currently pending in a number of other states. We believe that our products are manufactured and labeled in material compliance with existing state requirements, including the 2018 Missouri law, and pay close attention to any developments at the state or federal level that could apply to our products and our labeling claims.
We are also subject to the laws of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, China, the European Union (and individual member countries) and the United Kingdom, among others, and requirements specific to those jurisdictions could impose additional manufacturing or labeling requirements or restrictions. For example, in Europe, the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament proposed in May 2019 to reserve the use of “meat” and meat-related terms and names for products that are manufactured from the edible parts of animals. In October 2020, the European Parliament rejected the adoption of this provision. In the absence of European Union legislation, Member States remain free to establish national restrictions on meat-related names. In October 2021, France published a draft implementing decree (the “Decree”), to define, for example, the sanctions in case of non-compliance with the new law. The Decree was published on June 29, 2022, and entered into force on October 1, 2022. We do not believe that the Decree complies with the laws of the European Union, in particular the principle of free movement of goods. On July 27, 2022, at the request of a trade association, the French High Administrative Court partially suspended the execution of the Decree. This signals that there are indeed serious doubts as to the lawfulness of the Decree, though the suspension is only partial and temporary until the Court rules on the merits of the case. We also note that this prohibition has not been appropriately notified to the European Commission, and that as a result, the prohibition is, in principle, non-enforceable. In November 2021, Beyond Meat co-signed a letter from the European Alliance of Plant-Based 
Foods protesting this law. In October 2021, the Turkish authorities challenged the use of the Caped Longhorn superhero logo, as well as the name “Beyond Meat,” alleging that the consumer is misled as to the characteristics of our products. The local distributor has made a submission that this is an unlawful restriction under the EU-Turkey Free Trade Agreement. In December 2021, the Turkish authorities rejected this submission, and held that references to “plant-based” in combination with “meat” would mislead the consumer. Beyond Meat is actively monitoring these developments, but if adopted, they may require it to change its labeling and advertising.
We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, anti-corruption laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. Our operations, and those of our co-manufacturers, distributors and suppliers, are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and it is challenging to predict accurately the effect they may have upon the capital expenditures, earnings and our competitive position in the future.

Emerging Growth Company Status
Upon the completion of our IPO, we elected to be an Emerging Growth Company (“EGC”), as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. An EGC is defined as a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year. A company will retain its EGC status until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which it exceeds $1.07 billion in annual gross revenues; (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date it first sold securities pursuant to an initial public offering registration statement; (3) the date on which the EGC has, within the previous three years, issued $1 billion of nonconvertible debt; or (4) the date it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer (an SEC registered company with a public float of at least $700 million).
Effective December 31, 2020, we lost our EGC status and are now categorized as a Large Accelerated Filer based upon the current market capitalization of the Company according to Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). As a result, we must comply with all financial disclosure and governance requirements applicable to Large Accelerated Filers.
