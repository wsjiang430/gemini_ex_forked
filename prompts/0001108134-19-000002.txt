The Company offers a wide range of deposit, lending, insurance, and wealth management products to retail and commercial customers in its market areas. Its business goal is to expand and deepen market share and wallet share through organic growth and acquisition strategies.
The Bank serves the following regions shown below: 

• | Greater Boston, where the Company has relocated its headquarters in a prominent downtown Boston financial district location. This region includes 19 branch offices and several lending offices. The Company expanded in this region with its acquisition of Commerce Bancshares Corp. (“Commerce”) in October 2017. Berkshire’s asset based lending operations and the headquarters of its Firestone Financial subsidiary are located in this region. Greater Boston is the largest economic area in New England. The Greater Boston combined statistical area, including Worcester, is the sixth largest in the country. Boston is viewed as a leading commercial real estate market nationally, including foreign demand for investment real estate. Major local industries include biotechnology, technology, education, healthcare, trade, and financial service. The Boston MSA 2017 GDP was $439 billion and the Worcester 2017 MSA GDP was $44 billion.


• | Western New England, with 23 branches, includes the Company’s traditional Berkshire County market, where it has a leading market share in many of its product lines. This region also includes Southern Vermont, and many of the region’s branches are in communities close to Route 7, which runs north/south through the valleys to the west of the Berkshire Hills and Green Mountains. This region is within commuting range of both Albany, N.Y., and Springfield, Mass., and is known throughout the world as a tourist and recreational destination area, with vacation and second home traffic from Boston and New York City. The Pittsfield 2017 MSA GDP totaled $7 billion.


• | New York, with 40 branches serving the Albany Capital District and Central New York. Albany is the state capital and is part of New York’s Tech Valley which is gaining prominence as a world technology hub including leading edge nanotechnology initiatives representing a blend of private enterprise and public investment. The Company’s Central New York area includes operations in the Rome/Utica MSA and in the Syracuse MSA. These are markets along Interstate 90 with longstanding local industries and expansion influences from the Albany Capital District. The Albany/Schenectady 2017 MSA GDP was $54 billion, and the Rome/Utica/Syracuse total 2017 MSA GDP was $45 billion.


• | Hartford/Springfield, with 25 branches serving the market along the Connecticut River in this region, which is the second largest economic area in New England. This region is centrally located between Boston and New York City at the crossroads of Interstate 91, which traverses the length of New England, and Interstate 90, which traverses the width of Massachusetts. This region also has easy access to Bradley International Airport, which is a major airport serving central New England. Major local industries include insurance, defense manufacturing, education, and assembly/distribution. The Springfield area is receiving major commercial

5

investment including the first Massachusetts casino/entertainment complex. The Hartford/Springfield combined 2017 MSA GDP was $118 billion.

• | Mid-Atlantic, with 8 branches and mortgage banking and SBA lending operations. Berkshire established its presence in this region in 2016 with its acquisition of First Choice Bank (“First Choice”) located in the Princeton, New Jersey area and its acquisition of the business assets and operations of 44 Business Capital, LLC ("44 Business Capital"), located in the greater Philadelphia area. Major local industries include bio-science, financial services, trade, iron, steel, and rubber. The Philadelphia MSA 2017 GDP was $445 billion, while the Trenton 2017 MSA GDP was $30 billion.

Shown below is information about total loans and deposits within the Company’s banking footprint, by region, as of year-end 2018 (wholesale deposit and loan balances are excluded). 
These regions are viewed as having favorable economic and demographic characteristics and provide an attractive regional niche for the Bank to distinguish itself from larger national and super-regional banks, as well as from smaller community banks, while serving its market area. The Company’s regions have competitive economic strengths in precision manufacturing, distribution, technology, health care, and education which are expected to continue to support above average personal incomes and wealth. These regions include two major U.S. metropolitan areas and port cities - Boston and the Philadelphia area. As a result of its growth, the Company has increased and diversified its revenues both geographically and by product type and this has improved its flexibility in pursuing growth opportunities as they arise. The Company believes it has attractive long-term growth prospects because of the Bank’s positioning as a leading regional bank in its markets with the ability to serve retail and commercial customers with a strong product set and responsive local management. The Company has acquired and is developing targeted national lending operations to support its strategic growth and profitability. The Company also pursues organic growth through ongoing business development, de novo branching, product development, and delivery channel diversification and enhancement. 
The Company has a pending agreement to acquire SI Financial Group, which owns Savings Institute Bank & Trust, a $1.6 billion bank headquartered in Willimantic, Conn., with 23 branches serving Eastern Connecticut and Southern Rhode Island. This is viewed by Berkshire as a complementary market extension business combination.

COMPETITION
The Company is subject to strong competition from banks and other financial institutions and financial service providers. Its competition includes national and super-regional banks. Non-bank competitors include credit unions, brokerage firms, insurance providers, financial planners, and the mutual fund industry. New technology is reshaping customer interaction with financial service providers and the increase of internet-accessible financial institutions increases competition for the Company’s customers. The Company generally competes on the basis of customer service, relationship management, and the fair pricing of loan and deposit products and wealth management and insurance services. The location and convenience of branch offices is also a significant competitive factor, particularly regarding new offices. The Company does not rely on any individual, group, or entity for a material portion of its deposits.
LENDING ACTIVITIES
General. The Bank originates loans in the four basic portfolio categories discussed below. Lending activities are limited by federal and state laws and regulations. Loan interest rates and other key loan terms are affected principally by the Bank’s credit policy, asset/liability strategy, loan demand, competition, and the supply of money available for lending purposes. These factors, in turn, are affected by general and economic conditions, monetary policies of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve, legislative tax policies, and governmental budgetary matters. Most of the Bank’s loans held for investment are made in its market areas and are secured by real estate located in its market areas. Lending is therefore affected by activity in these real estate markets. The Bank does not engage in subprime lending activities. The Bank monitors and manages the amount of long-term fixed-rate lending volume. Adjustable-rate loan products generally reduce interest rate risk but may produce higher loan losses in the event of sustained rate increases. The Bank generally originates loans for investment except for residential mortgages, which are generally originated for sale on a servicing released basis. Additionally, the Bank also originates SBA 7A loans for sale to investors. The Bank also conducts wholesale purchases and sales of loans and loan participations generally with other banks doing business in its markets, including selected national banks.
The Bank changed its charter several years ago from a savings bank to a trust company, which is the common charter for Massachusetts chartered commercial banks. The majority of the Bank’s held for investment loans are commercial loans. The Company’s strategy is to be a leading regional bank in its markets, and to develop commercial market share and wallet share across its commercial banking product areas. The Company’s recent expansion into more urban markets is targeted to facilitate further development of this strategy. The Company also is building its specialized commercial business lines which have higher margins and provide for revenue diversification and geographic expansion into other national markets. The Bank has focused on team recruitments to establish its market prominence and deliver revenue synergies in new markets entered by acquisition.

Commercial Real Estate. The Bank originates commercial real estate loans on properties used for business purposes such as small office buildings, industrial, healthcare, lodging, recreation, or retail facilities. Commercial real estate loans are provided on owner-occupied properties and on investor-owned properties. The portfolio includes commercial 1-4 family and multifamily properties. The Bank’s expansion in Greater Boston may involve increased lending to finance new types of properties and reliance on more expensive property values compared to its traditional markets. Loans may generally be made with amortizations of up to 25 years and with interest rates that adjust periodically (primarily from short-term to five years). Most commercial real estate loans are originated with final maturities of 10 years or less. As part of its business activities, the Bank also enters into commercial loan participations with regional and national banks and purchases and sells commercial loans. 
Commercial real estate loans are among the largest of the Bank’s loans, and may have higher credit risk and lending spreads. Because repayment is often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of commercial real estate loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. The Bank seeks to manage these risks through its underwriting disciplines and portfolio management processes. The Bank generally requires that borrowers have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of available cash flows before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.25 times based on stabilized cash flows of leases in place, with some exceptions for national credit tenants. For variable rate loans, the Bank underwrites debt service coverage to interest rate shocks of 300 basis points or higher based on a minimum of 1.0 times coverage and it uses loan maturities to manage risk based on the lease base and interest sensitivity. Loans at origination may be made up to 80% of appraised value based on property type and risk, with sublimits of 75% or less for designated specialty property types. Generally, commercial real estate loans are supported by full or partial personal guarantees by the principals. Credit enhancements in the form of additional collateral or guarantees are normally considered for start-up businesses without a qualifying cash flow history.
The Bank offers interest rate swaps to certain larger commercial mortgage borrowers. These swaps allow the Bank to originate a mortgage based on short-term LIBOR rates and allow the borrower to swap into a longer-term fixed rate. The Bank simultaneously sells an offsetting back-to-back swap to an investment grade national bank so that it does not retain this fixed-rate risk. The Bank also records fee income on these interest rate swaps based on the terms of the offsetting swaps with the bank counterparties.

The Bank originates construction loans to developers and commercial borrowers in and around its markets. The maximum loan to value limits for construction loans follow FDIC supervisory limits, up to a maximum of 85 percent. The Bank commits to provide the permanent mortgage financing on most of its construction loans on income-producing property. Advances on construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of the improvements. Construction loans include land acquisition loans up to a maximum 50 percent loan to value on raw land. Construction loans may have greater credit risk due to the dependence on completion of construction and other real estate improvements, as well as the sale or rental of the improved property. The Bank generally mitigates these risks with presale or preleasing requirements and phasing of construction.

Commercial and Industrial Loans. The Bank offers secured commercial term loans with repayment terms which are normally limited to the expected useful life of the asset being financed, and generally not exceeding ten years. The Bank also offers revolving loans, lines of credit, letters of credit, time notes and Small Business Administration guaranteed loans. Business lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest and can be committed or are payable on demand, subject to annual review and renewal. Commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by a variety of collateral such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and are generally supported by personal guarantees. Loan-to-value ratios depend on the collateral type and generally do not exceed 80 percent of orderly liquidation value. Some commercial loans may also be secured by liens on real estate. The Bank generally does not make unsecured commercial loans. Commercial loans are of higher risk and are made primarily on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flows of its business. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to monitor and appraise and may fluctuate in value. The Bank gives additional consideration to the borrower’s credit history and the guarantor’s capacity to help mitigate these risks. Additionally, the Bank uses loan structures including shorter terms, amortizations, and advance rate limitations to additionally mitigate credit risk. The Company considers these loans, together with its owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, as constituting the primary relationship based component of its commercial lending activities.
The Asset Based Lending Group serves the commercial middle market in New England, as well as the Bank’s market in northeastern New York. In 2017, this group expanded into the Mid-Atlantic. The group expands the Bank’s business lending offerings to include revolving lines of credit and term loans secured by accounts receivable, inventory, and other assets to manufacturers, distributors and select service companies experiencing seasonal working capital needs, rapid sales growth, a turnaround, buyout or recapitalization with credit needs ranging from $2 to $25 million. Asset based lending involves monitoring loan collateral so that outstanding balances are always properly secured by business assets, which reduces the risks associated with these loans. At year-end 2018, asset based loans outstanding totaled $452 million.
In 2016, the Bank created the Specialty Lending Group to oversee its equipment lending, SBA lending, and small business lending activities. The specialty equipment lending operation is conducted by Firestone Financial Corp. ("Firestone"), which was acquired in 2015. Firestone originates loans secured by business-essential equipment through over 160 equipment distributors and manufacturers and directly via the end borrower in all 50 states. Key customer segments include the fitness, carnival, gaming, and entertainment industries. These loans function similarly to the Bank’s commercial and industrial portfolio. However, some credits have payment schedules tailored to the meet the needs of the seasonality of these borrowers’ businesses. These loans generally have higher interest rates than the Bank's other commercial loans, reflecting the niche expertise required in servicing these industries. Firestone’s loans outstanding totaled $265 million at year-end 2018.
In 2016, Berkshire acquired 44 Business Capital, a dedicated SBA 7(a) program lending team based in the Philadelphia area. This team originates loans primarily in the Mid-Atlantic area. This team sells the guaranteed portions of these loans with servicing retained and the Bank retains the unguaranteed portions of the loans, which are pari-passu with the SBA for loan repayment. Some of the SBA’s underwriting parameters are outside of the Bank’s normal commercial lending standards. The Bank is a preferred SBA lender and closely manages the servicing portfolio pursuant to SBA requirements. This team is the Bank’s largest source of commercial lending fee revenue, and it is targeting to further expand these operations to other markets, as well as increasing SBA product penetration to the market served by Firestone. Berkshire also originates SBA loans in its regional markets. The SBA’s annual report of SBA originators for the year-ended September 30, 2018 ranked Berkshire among the top 30th
9

in the nation by both number of loans and dollar amount of loans. Berkshire has the top SBA ranking in several of its regional markets. 
Residential Mortgages. Through its mortgage banking operations, the Bank offers fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans to individuals with maturities of up to 30 years that are fully amortizing with monthly loan payments. The majority of loans are originated for sale with rate lock commitments which are recorded as derivative financial instruments. Mortgages are generally underwritten according to U.S. government sponsored enterprise guidelines designated as “A” or “A-” and referred to as “conforming loans”. The Bank also originates jumbo loans above conforming loan amounts which generally are consistent with secondary market guidelines for these loans and are often held in portfolio. The Bank does not offer subprime mortgage lending programs. The Bank buys and sells seasoned mortgages primarily with smaller financial institutions operating in its markets.
The majority of the Bank’s secondary marketing is to U.S. secondary market investors on a servicing-released basis. The Bank also sells directly to government sponsored enterprises with servicing retained. Mortgage sales generally involve customary representations and warranties and are nonrecourse in the event of borrower default. The Bank is also an approved originator of loans for sale to the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (“VA”), state housing agency programs, and other government sponsored mortgage programs.
The Bank does not offer interest-only or negative amortization mortgage loans. Adjustable rate mortgage loan interest rates may rise as interest rates rise, thereby increasing the potential for default. The Bank also originates construction loans which generally provide 15-month construction periods followed by a permanent mortgage loan, and follow the Bank’s normal mortgage underwriting guidelines.
Most of the Bank’s mortgages are originated by commissioned mortgage lenders. With the First Choice Bank acquisition in December 2016, the Company acquired First Choice Loan Services Inc. ("First Choice Loan Services"), which now operates its mortgage banking business as a subsidiary of Berkshire Bank. This operation has a team of more than 400 members originating mortgages in targeted markets in nine states, with headquarters in East Brunswick, N.J. First Choice Loan Services originates directly through its originators as well as online including a mortgage marketing partnership with Costco. 
Berkshire’s mortgage banking operations are its largest source of non-interest revenue. The portfolio of mortgages held for sale is a high yielding short term asset. The Bank’s portfolio of mortgages held for investment is a significant source of interest income to the bank. Mortgage operations require significant interest rate risk management both for the interest rate lock derivative financial instruments and for the long term assets held in portfolio. Mortgage banking also requires flexible and scalable operations due to the volatility of mortgage demand over time. Investor management is integral to maintaining the secondary market support that is required for these operations. The management of commissioned originations staff across national markets in this highly regulated business line requires strong controls and compliance management.
10

Consumer Loans. The Bank’s consumer loans are centrally underwritten and processed by its experienced consumer lending team based in Syracuse, New York. The Bank’s primary consumer lending activity is indirect auto lending. In the second half of 2015, the Bank recruited new leadership to expand this activity from its Central New York base to other parts of Berkshire’s footprint. The Bank provides prime auto loans to finance new and used autos and is evaluating secondary marketing to further support this activity. At year-end 2018, outstanding auto and other loans totaled $720 million. The Bank’s other major consumer lending activity is prime home equity lending, following its conforming mortgage underwriting guidelines with more streamlined verifications and documentation. Most of these outstanding loans are prime based home equity lines with a maximum combined loan-to-value of 85 percent. Home equity line credit risks include the risk that higher interest rates will affect repayment and possible compression of collateral coverage on second lien home equity lines. At year-end 2018, home equity loans totaled $377 million.
Maturity and Sensitivity of Loan Portfolio. The following table shows contractual final maturities of selected loan categories at year-end 2018. The contractual maturities do not reflect premiums, discounts, deferred costs, or prepayments.

Item 1 - Table 2 - Loan Contractual Maturity - Scheduled Loan Amortizations are not included in the maturities presented.

Contractual Maturity | One Year | | One to | | More Than | | 
(In thousands) | or Less | | Five Years | | Five Years | | Total 
Construction real estate loans: | | | | | | | | | 
Commercial | $ | 196,394 | | | $ | 156,618 | | $ | — | $ | 353,012 
Residential | 8,070 | | | 341 | | | 1,345 | | 9,756 
Commercial and industrial loans | 355,477 | | | 1,025,178 | | | 599,391 | | 1,980,046
Total | $ | 559,941 | | | $ | 1,182,137 | | $ | 600,736 | $ | 2,342,814


For the $1.8 billion of loans above which mature in more than one year, $0.5 billion of these loans are fixed-rate and $1.3 billion are variable rate.
Loan Administration. Lending activities are governed by a loan policy approved by the Board’s Risk Management and Capital Committee. Internal staff perform and monitor post-closing loan documentation review, quality control, and commercial loan administration. The lending staff assigns a risk rating to all commercial loans, excluding point scored small business loans. Management primarily relies on internal risk management staff to review the risk ratings of the majority of commercial loan balances.
The Bank’s lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Risk Management and Capital Committee and Management, under the leadership of the Chief Risk Officer. The Bank’s loan underwriting is based on a review of certain factors including risk ratings, recourse, loan-to-value ratios, and material policy exceptions. The Risk Management and Capital Committee has established individual and combined loan limits and lending approval authorities. Management’s Executive Loan Committee is responsible for commercial loan approvals in accordance with these standards and procedures. Generally, pass rated secured commercial loans can be approved jointly up to $7 million by the regional lending manager and regional credit officer. Loans up to $15 million can be approved with the additional signature of the Chief Credit Officer. Loans in excess of this amount, and designated lower rated loans are approved by the Executive Loan Committee. These limits were expanded in 2016. The Bank tracks loan underwriting exceptions and exception reports are actively monitored by executive lending management.
The Bank’s lending activities are conducted by its salaried and commissioned loan personnel. Designated salaried branch staff originate conforming residential mortgages and receive bonuses based on overall performance. Additionally, the Bank employs commissioned residential mortgage originators. Commercial lenders receive salaries and are eligible for bonuses based on individual and overall performance. The Bank purchases whole loans and participations in loans from banks headquartered in its market and from outside of its market. These loans are underwritten according to the Bank’s underwriting criteria and procedures and are generally serviced by the 
11

originating lender under terms of the applicable agreement. The Bank routinely sells newly originated, fixed-rate residential mortgages in the secondary market. Customer rate locks are offered without charge and rate locked applications are generally committed for forward sale or hedged with derivative financial instruments to minimize interest rate risk pending delivery of the loans to the investors. The Bank also sells residential mortgages and commercial loan participations on a non-recourse basis. The Bank issues loan commitments to its prospective borrowers conditioned on the occurrence of certain events. Loan origination commitments are made in writing on specified terms and conditions and are generally honored for up to 60 days from approval; some commercial commitments are made for longer terms. The Company also monitors pipelines of loan applications and has processes for issuing letters of interest for commercial loans and pre-approvals for residential mortgages, all of which are generally conditional on completion of underwriting prior to the issuance of formal commitments.
The loan policy sets certain limits on concentrations of credit and requires periodic reporting of concentrations to the Risk Management and Capital Committee. The Bank also actively monitors its 25 largest borrower relationships. Commercial real estate is generally managed within federal regulatory monitoring guidelines of 300% of risk based capital for non-owner occupied commercial real estate and 100% for construction loans. At year-end 2018, non-owner occupied commercial real estate totaled 238% of Bank risk based capital and outstanding construction loans were 34% of Bank risk based capital. The Bank has hold limits for several categories of commercial specialty lending including healthcare, hospitality, designated franchises, and leasing, as well as hold limits for designated commercial loan participations purchased. In most cases, these limits are below 100% of risk based capital for all outstandings in each monitored category.
Problem Assets. The Bank prefers to work with borrowers to resolve problems rather than proceeding to foreclosure. For commercial loans, this may result in a period of forbearance or restructuring of the loan, which is normally done at current market terms and does not result in a “troubled” loan designation. For residential mortgage loans, the Bank generally follows FDIC guidelines to attempt a restructuring that will enable owner-occupants to remain in their home. However, if these processes fail to result in a performing loan, then the Bank generally will initiate foreclosure or other proceedings no later than the 90th day of a delinquency, as necessary, to minimize any potential loss. Management reports delinquent loans and non-performing assets to the Board quarterly. Loans are generally removed from accruing status when they reach 90 days delinquent, except for certain loans which are well secured and in the process of collection. Loan collections are managed by a combination of the related business units and the Bank’s special assets group, which focuses on larger, riskier collections and the recovery of purchased credit impaired loans.
Real estate obtained by the Bank as a result of loan collections, including foreclosures, is classified as real estate owned until sold. When property is acquired it is recorded at fair market value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Holding costs and decreases in fair value after acquisition are expensed. Interest income that would have been recorded for 2018, if non-accruing loans had been current according to their original terms, amounted to $4.2 million. Included in the amount is $948 thousand related to troubled debt restructurings. The amount of interest income on those loans that was recognized in net income in 2018 was $1.7 million. Included in this amount is $318 thousand related to troubled debt restructurings. Interest income on accruing troubled debt restructurings totaled $652 thousand for 2018. The total carrying value of troubled debt restructurings was $27.4 million at year-end.
12

The following table sets forth additional information on year-end problem assets and accruing troubled debt restructurings (“TDR”). Due to accounting standards for business combinations, non-accrual loans of acquired banks are recorded as accruing on the acquisition date. Therefore, measures related to accruing and non-accruing loans reflect these standards and may not be comparable to prior periods.

Asset Classification and Delinquencies. The Bank performs an internal analysis of its commercial loan portfolio and assets to classify such loans and assets in a manner similar to that employed by federal banking regulators. There are four classifications for loans with higher than normal risk: Loss, Doubtful, Substandard, and Special Mention. Usually an asset classified as Loss is fully charged-off. Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses, are designated Special Mention. Please see the additional discussion of non-accruing and potential problem loans in Item 7 and additional information in Note 7 - Loan Loss Allowance of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impaired loans acquired in business combinations are normally rated Substandard or lower and the fair value assigned to such loans at acquisition includes a component for the possibility of loss if deficiencies are not corrected.
Allowance for Loan Losses. The Bank’s loan portfolio is regularly reviewed by management to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The allowance represents management’s estimate of inherent incurred losses that are probable and estimable as of the date of the financial statements. The allowance includes a specific component for impaired loans (a “specific loan loss reserve”) and a general component for portfolios of all outstanding loans (a “general loan loss reserve”). At the time of acquisition, no allowance for loan losses is assigned to loans acquired in business combinations. These loans are initially recorded at fair value, including the impact of expected losses, as of the acquisition date. An allowance on such loans is established subsequent to the acquisition date through the provision for loan losses based on an analysis of factors including environmental factors.  The loan loss allowance is discussed further in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses. However, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary, and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making its determinations. Because the estimation of inherent losses cannot be made with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loan or loan portfolio 
13

category deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Additionally, the regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, also periodically review the Bank’s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to make additional provisions for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of management. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect the Bank’s financial condition and results of operations.
The following table presents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the five years indicated:

The following tables present year-end data for the approximate allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan categories at the dates indicated (including an apportionment of any unallocated amount). The first table shows for each category the amount of the allowance allocated to that category as a percentage of the outstanding loans in that category. The second table shows the allocated allowance together with the percentage of loans in each category to total loans. Management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of any of the allowance to absorb losses in any category. Due to the impact of accounting standards for acquired loans, data in the accompanying tables may not be comparable between accounting periods.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES ACTIVITIES
The securities portfolio provides cash flow to protect the safety of customer deposits and as a potential source of liquidity. The portfolio is also used to manage interest rate risk and to earn a reasonable return on investment. Decisions are made in accordance with the Company’s investment policy and include consideration of risk, return, duration, and portfolio concentrations. Day-to-day oversight of the portfolio rests with the Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer. The Enterprise Risk Management/Asset-Liability Committee meets multiple times each quarter and reviews investment strategies. The Risk Management and Capital Committee of the Board of Directors provides general oversight of the investment function.
The Company has historically maintained a high-quality portfolio of managed duration mortgage-backed securities, together with a portfolio of municipal bonds including national and local issuers and local economic development bonds issued to non-profit organizations. Nearly all of the mortgage-backed securities are issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, consisting principally of collateralized mortgage obligations (generally consisting of planned amortization class bonds). Other than securities issued by the above agencies, no other issuer concentrations exceeding 10% of stockholders’ equity existed at year-end 2018. The municipal portfolio provides tax-advantaged yield, and the local economic development bonds were originated by the Company to area borrowers. The Company invests in investment grade corporate bonds and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Purchases of non-investment grade fixed-income securities have consisted primarily of capital instruments issued by local and regional financial institutions and a mutual fund investing in non-investment grade bonds of national corporate issuers and in community reinvestment projects. The Company also invests in equity securities of local financial institutions, including those that might be future potential partners, as well as dividend yielding equity securities of national corporate exchange traded issuers. Historically, the Company acquired equity securities in the Bank, which was allowed under its savings bank charter. As a result of the Bank's charter change in 2014, equity security purchases after that date have been conducted at the holding company level. The Bank owns restricted equity in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”) based on its operating relationship with the FHLBB. The Company owns an interest rate swap against a tax advantaged economic development bond issued to a local not-for-profit organization, and as a result this security is carried as a trading account security. The Company generally designates debt securities as available for sale, but sometimes designates longer-duration municipal securities as held to maturity based on its intent. This also allows the Company to more effectively manage the potential impact of longer-duration, fixed-rate securities on stockholders' equity in the event of rising interest rates. Based on a new accounting pronouncement effective in 2018, changes in fair value on equity securities are recorded to current period income, rather than to equity.
The following tables present the year-end amortized cost and fair value of the Company’s securities, by type of security, for the three years indicated.

The following table summarizes year-end 2018 amortized cost, weighted average yields, and contractual maturities of debt securities. Yields are shown on a fully taxable equivalent basis. A significant portion of the mortgage-based securities are planned amortization class bonds. Their expected durations are 3-5 years at current interest rates, but the contractual maturities shown reflect the underlying maturities of the collateral mortgages. Additionally, the mortgage-based securities maturities shown below are based on final maturities and do not include scheduled amortization. Yields include amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts.

DEPOSIT ACTIVITIES AND OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS
Deposits are the major source of funds for the Bank’s lending and investment activities. Deposit accounts are the primary product and service interaction with the Bank’s customers. The Bank serves personal, commercial, non-profit, and municipal deposit customers. Most of the Bank’s deposits are generated from the areas surrounding its branch offices. The Bank offers a wide variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. The Bank also periodically offers promotional interest rates and terms for limited periods of time. The Bank’s deposit accounts consist of demand deposits (non-interest-bearing checking), NOW (interest-bearing checking), regular savings, money market savings, and time certificates of deposit. The Bank emphasizes its transaction deposits -- checking and NOW accounts -- for personal accounts and checking accounts promoted to businesses. These accounts have the lowest marginal cost to the Bank and are also often a core account for a customer relationship. The Bank offers a courtesy overdraft program to improve customer service, and also provides debit cards and other electronic fee producing payment services to transaction account customers. The Bank offers targeted online deposit account opening capabilities for personal accounts. The Bank promotes remote deposit capture devices so that commercial accounts can make deposits from their place of business. Additionally, the Bank offers a variety of retirement deposit accounts to personal and business customers. Deposit related fees are a significant source of fee income to the Bank, including overdraft and interchange fees related to debit card usage. Deposit service fee income also includes other miscellaneous transactions and convenience services sold to customers through the branch system as part of an overall service relationship. The Bank offers compensating balance arrangements for larger business customers as an alternative to fees charged for checking account services. Berkshire’s Business Connection is a personal financial services benefit package designed for the employees of its business customers. In addition to providing service through its branches, Berkshire provides services to deposit customers through its private bankers, MyBankers, commercial/small business relationship managers, and call center representatives. Commercial cash management services are an important commercial service offered to commercial depositors and a fee income source to the bank. With the Commerce acquisition, the Bank acquired a commercial payment processing business that serves regional and national payroll service bureau customers. Online banking and mobile banking functionality is increasingly important as a component of deposit account access and service delivery. The Bank is also gradually deploying its MyTeller video tellers to complement and extend its service capabilities in its branches.
The Company also is monitoring the development of payment services which are growing in their importance in the personal and commercial deposit markets. Near the end of 2017, the Company recruited experienced senior officers to enhance its offerings and market development for government banking and international services, which are expected to support further development of commercial deposit sources.
17

The Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank utilizes brokered time deposits to broaden its funding base, augment its interest rate risk management vehicles, and to support loan growth. The Bank also offers brokered reciprocal money market arrangements to provide additional deposit protection to certain large commercial and institutional accounts. These balances are viewed as part of overall relationship balances with regional customers. Brokered deposits are sourced through selected Board approved brokers; these deposits are viewed as potentially more volatile than other deposits and are managed as a component of the Bank's liquidity policies.
The following table presents information concerning average balances and weighted average interest rates on the Bank’s interest-bearing deposit accounts for the years indicated.

The Company also uses borrowings from the FHLBB as an additional source of funding, particularly for daily cash management and for funding longer duration assets. FHLBB advances also provide more pricing and option alternatives for particular asset/liability needs. The FHLBB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member institutions. As an FHLBB member, the Company is required to own capital stock of the organization. Borrowings from this institution are secured by a blanket lien on most of the Bank’s mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities, as well as certain other assets. Advances are made under several different credit programs with different lending standards, interest rates, and range of maturities. 
The Company has a $15 million trust preferred obligation outstanding as well as $74 million in senior subordinated notes. The Company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Subject to certain limitations, the Company can also choose to issue common stock, preferred stock, subordinated debt, or senior debt in public stock offerings or private placements. The Company maintains a universal shelf registration with the SEC to facilitate future potential capital issuances.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company offers interest rate swaps to commercial loan customers who wish to fix the interest rates on their loans, and the Company backs these swaps with offsetting swaps with national bank counterparties. With other lending institutions, the Company engages in risk participation agreements. These arrangements are structured similarly to its swaps with commercial borrowers, but a different bank is the lead underwriter. The Company gets paid a fee to take on the risk associated with having to make the lead bank whole on Berkshire’s portion of the pro-rated swap should the borrower default. These swaps are designated as economic hedges. Based on changes in federal regulation, interest rate swaps that meet certain criteria to be viewed as conforming are required to be cleared through exchanges beginning when the $10 billion threshold is crossed. The Bank has designated a national financial institution as its clearing agent.
The Company’s mortgage banking activities result in derivatives. Commitments to lend are provided on applications for residential mortgages intended for resale and are accounted for as non-hedging derivatives. The Company arranges offsetting forward sales commitments for most of these rate-locks with national bank counterparties, which are designated as economic hedges. Commitments on applications intended to be held for investment are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments. The Company has a policy for managing its derivative financial instruments, and the policy and program activity are overseen by the Risk Management and Capital Committee. Derivative financial instruments with counterparties which are not customers are limited to a select number of national financial institutions. Collateral may be required based on financial condition tests. The Company works with third-party firms which assist in marketing derivative transactions, executing transactions, and providing information for bookkeeping and accounting purposes.
The Company sometimes uses interest rate swap instruments for its own account to fix the interest rate on some of its borrowings, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges. The Company terminated its outstanding cash flow hedges in the first quarter of 2017. The Company evaluates these hedges as part of its overall interest rate risk management. The Company also expects to begin offering forward foreign exchange derivatives to its commercial markets as part of its expanded international banking services. The Company expects to back these forwards with offsetting forwards with national bank counterparties. This activity would be targeted to support routine commercial needs of customers engaged in international trading activities and would only be offered for bank approved currencies and durations.

SUBSIDIARY ACTIVITIES
The Company wholly-owns two active consolidated subsidiaries: the Bank and Berkshire Insurance Group, Inc. The Bank operates as a commercial bank under a Massachusetts trust company charter. Berkshire Insurance Group is incorporated in Massachusetts. Berkshire Bank owns Firestone Financial, LLC which is a Massachusetts limited liability company, First Choice Loan Services Inc. which is a New Jersey corporation, as well as consolidated subsidiaries operated as Massachusetts securities corporations. The Company also owns all of the common stock of a Delaware statutory business trust, Berkshire Hills Capital Trust I. The capital trust is unconsolidated and its only material asset is a $15 million trust preferred security related to the junior subordinated debentures reported in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information about the subsidiaries is contained in Exhibit 21 to this report.
REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
The Company is a Delaware corporation and a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As such, it is registered with, supervised by and required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board requires the Company to file various reports and also conducts examinations of the Company. The Company must receive the approval of the Federal Reserve Board to engage in certain transactions, such as acquisitions of additional banks and savings associations.
The Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered trust company and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank was previously a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank and converted to a Massachusetts-chartered trust company in July 2014. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks (the “Commissioner”), as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, as its deposit insurer. The Bank is required to file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions or branches of other institutions. The Commissioner and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to test the Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. The regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Commissioner, the Massachusetts legislature, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the Bank, and their operations.
Federal Legislation
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and is affecting the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. 
Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act were subject to delayed effective dates and/or the issuance of implementing regulations. The regulatory process is ongoing and the impact on operations cannot yet be fully assessed. However, the Dodd-Frank Act has, and is expected to continue to, at a minimum, result in increased regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for the Company and the Bank.
Certain regulatory requirements applicable to the Company are referred to below. The description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their holding companies set forth in this Form 10-
20

K does not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Company and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations.
Massachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision
General. As a Massachusetts-chartered depository institution, the Bank is subject to various Massachusetts statutes and regulations which govern, among other things, investment powers, lending and deposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus and reserve accounts, distribution of earnings and payment of dividends. In addition, the Bank is subject to Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights laws and regulations. The approval of the Commissioner is required for a Massachusetts-chartered institution to establish or close branches, merge with other financial institutions, issue stock, and undertake certain other activities.
Massachusetts law and regulations generally allow Massachusetts institutions to engage in activities permissible for federally chartered banks or banks chartered by another state. There is a 30-day notice procedure to the Commissioner in order to engage in such activities. Massachusetts law also authorized Massachusetts institutions to engage in activities determined to be “financial in nature,” or incidental or complementary to such a financial activity, subject to a 30-day notice to the Commissioner.
Dividends. Under Massachusetts law, the Bank may declare cash dividends from net profits not more frequently than quarterly and non-cash dividends at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited, or paid if the institution’s capital stock is impaired. An institution with outstanding preferred stock may not, without the prior approval of the Commissioner, declare dividends to the common stock without also declaring dividends to the preferred stock. The approval of the Commissioner is generally required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained “net profits,” as defined, of the preceding two years.
Loans to One Borrower Limitations. Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions, total obligations of one borrower to an institution may not exceed 20.0% of the total of the institution’s capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of the institution’s capital stock, surplus account and undivided profits.
Investment Activities. In general, Massachusetts-chartered institutions may invest in preferred and common stock of any corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state provided such investments do not involve control of any corporation and do not, in the aggregate, exceed 4.0% of the bank’s deposits. Massachusetts-chartered institutions may also invest an amount equal to 1.0% of their deposits in stocks of Massachusetts corporations or companies with substantial employment in Massachusetts which have pledged to the Commissioner that such monies will be used for further development within the Commonwealth. However, these powers are constrained by federal law, which generally limit the activities and equity investments of state banks to those permitted for national banks.
Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Any Massachusetts-chartered institution that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies, and directives of the Commissioner may be sanctioned for non-compliance, including seizure of the property and business of the institution and suspension or revocation of its charter. The Commissioner may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the institution’s business in a manner which is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors interests, or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, upon finding that an institution has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Commissioner may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the institution concerned. Finally, Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to the Bank permit private individual and class action lawsuits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney’s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes.
Massachusetts has other statutes or regulations that are similar to the federal provisions discussed below.
21

Federal Regulations
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. The Bank chose the opt-out election. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% and 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 
In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. As a bank holding company, the Company is also subject to regulatory capital requirements, as described in a subsequent section.
Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits an institution, such as the Bank, to acquire another institution by merger in a state other than Massachusetts unless the other state has opted out. Federal law, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, authorizes de novo branching into another state to the extent that the target state allows its state chartered banks to establish branches within its borders. The Bank currently operates branches in New York, Vermont, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania as well as Massachusetts. At its interstate branches, the Bank may conduct any activity authorized under Massachusetts law that is permissible either for an institution chartered in that state (subject to applicable federal restrictions) or a branch in that state of an out-of-state national bank. The New York State Superintendent of Banks, the Vermont Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, the Connecticut Commissioner of Banking, the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance and the Pennsylvania Secretary of Banking and Securities may exercise certain regulatory authority over the Bank’s branches in their respective states.
22

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes three categories of capital deficient institutions: undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. The FDIC regulations implementing the prompt corrective action law were amended to incorporate the previously discussed increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.
“Undercapitalized” banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend), and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank’s compliance with such plans must be guaranteed by its holding company in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s total assets when deemed “undercapitalized” or the amount needed to comply with regulatory capital requirements. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce assets and cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions must comply with additional sanctions including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized” as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations.
Transactions with Affiliates and Loans to Insiders. Transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. In a holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of an institution and any companies which are controlled by the holding company are affiliates of the institution. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the institution or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions,” such as loans, with any one affiliate to 10% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus. There is also an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to 20% of capital stock and surplus. Loans to affiliates and certain other specified transactions must comply with specified collateralization requirements. Section 23B requires that transactions with affiliates be on terms that are no less favorable to the institution or its subsidiary as similar transactions with non-affiliates.
Federal law also restricts an institution with respect to loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders (“insiders”). Loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the institution’s total capital and surplus. Loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the Board of Directors. Further, loans to insiders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the institution’s employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Federal law places additional limitations on loans to executive officers. Massachusetts law previously had a separate law regarding insider transactions but that law was amended in 2015 to generally incorporate the federal restrictions.
23

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Bank’s deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC up to applicable limits. The FDIC insures deposits up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount (“SMDIA”) of $250,000.
The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits.
Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assessed based on perceived risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund with institutions deemed less risky pay lower FDIC assessments. Assessments for institutions with $10 billion or more of assets are primarily based on a scorecard approached by the FDIC, including factors such as examination ratings and modeling measuring the institution’s ability to withstand asset-related and funding-related stress and potential loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund should the bank fail. The assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments specified by the regulations) for institutions with greater than $10 billion of total assets is 1.5 to 40 basis points. The Dodd-Frank Act required that banks of greater than $10 billion of assets bear the burden of raising the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. Such institutions were subject to an annual surcharge of 4.5 basis points of total assets exceeding $10 billion, effective July 1, 2016. The FDIC announced in November 2018 that the 1.35% reserve ratio had been reached so that the surcharges would cease.
FDIC insured institutions are also required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. These assessments continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in September 2019. The assessment rate is adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment base of the fund. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the Financing Corporation assessment amounted to 0.32 basis points of total assets less Tier 1 capital.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a regulator. Management does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of FDIC deposit insurance.
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks that provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. The Bank, as a member, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLBB.
The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for certain purposes including contributing funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements, and general financial results, could reduce the amount of dividends that the Federal Home Loan Banks pay to their members and result in the Federal Home Loan Banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. Historically, the FHLBB has paid dividends to member banks based on money market rates. 
Enforcement
The FDIC has primary federal enforcement responsibility over state chartered banks that are not members of Federal Reserve System, which includes the Bank. The FDIC has authority to bring enforcement actions against such institutions and their “institution-related parties,” including officers, directors, certain shareholders, and attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution or receivership or conservatorship in certain circumstances. Potential civil money penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25 thousand per day or, in extreme cases, as high as $1.0 million per day.
24

Holding Company Regulation
General. The Company is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any other bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than five percent of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company.
A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than five percent of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. The Federal Reserve Board has allowed by regulation some exceptions based on activities closely related to banking including: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; and (v) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being “well capitalized” and “well managed” as defined in the regulations, to opt to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities. Such activities can include insurance and investment banking. The Company has elected to become a financial holding company.
The Company is subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s capital adequacy requirements for bank holding companies.  The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implemented the Dodd-Frank Act as to bank holding company capital standards. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the Bank applied to the Company, effective January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer was phased in beginning in 2016 and was fully effective on January 1, 2019.
Federal Reserve Board policy requires that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine.
The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to dividends in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends’ previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized.
Federal regulations require a bank holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any repurchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the repurchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such repurchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption under certain circumstances. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. Federal Reserve policy provides for regulatory consultation prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments under specified circumstances regardless of the applicability of the previously referenced notification 
25

requirement. Most recently, the Federal Reserve Board’s staff has been interpreting its regulatory capital regulation as requiring a bank holding company to apply and receive its approval before repurchasing or redeeming shares that are included by the holding company for regulatory capital purposes.
These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of its stock, or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
The status of the Company as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws.
Acquisition of the Company. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as the Company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, is the case with the Company, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Massachusetts Holding Company Regulation. In addition to the federal holding company regulations, a bank holding company organized or doing business in Massachusetts must comply with requirements under Massachusetts law. Approval of the Massachusetts regulatory authorities is generally be required for the Company to acquire 25 percent or more of the voting stock of another depository institution. Similarly, prior regulatory approval would be necessary for any person or company to acquire 25 percent or more of the voting stock of the Company.
Mergers and Acquisitions
The Company and the Bank have authority to engage, and have engaged, in acquisitions of other depository institutions. Such transactions are subject to a variety of conditions including, but not limited to, required stockholder approvals and the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. Necessary regulatory approvals include those required by the federal Bank Holding Company Act and/or Bank Merger Act, Massachusetts law and, if the target institution is located in a state other than Massachusetts, the law of that state. When considering merger applications, the federal regulators must evaluate such factors as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the parties, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including performance of the parties under the Community Reinvestment Act), competitive factors, any risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system and the effectiveness of the institutions involved in combating money laundering activities. Both the Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act provide for a waiting period of 15 to 30 days following approval by the federal banking regulator within which the United States Department of Justice may file objections to the merger under the federal antitrust laws. Massachusetts law requires the Commissioner (or Board of Bank Incorporation in certain cases) to consider such factors as whether competition among banking institutions will be unreasonably affected and whether public convenience and advantage will be promoted (including whether the merger will result in net new benefits).
26

Other Regulations
Consumer Protection Laws. The Bank is subject to federal and state consumer protection statutes and regulations applicable to depository institutions. These include the Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide certain information about home mortgage and refinance loans; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; the Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information; the Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, governing automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.
The Bank also is subject to Massachusetts and federal laws protecting the confidentiality of consumer financial records, and limiting the ability of the institution to share non-public personal information with third parties.
The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) establishes a requirement for federal banking agencies that, in connection with examinations of depository institutions within their jurisdiction, the agencies evaluate the record of the depository institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial non-compliance.” A less than “satisfactory” rating would result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved. As of the most recent CRA examination by the FDIC, the Bank’s CRA rating was “satisfactory.”
Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The Bank is subject to extensive anti-money laundering provisions and requirements, which require the institution to have in place a comprehensive customer identification program and an anti-money laundering program and procedures. These laws and regulations also prohibit depository institutions from engaging in business with foreign shell banks; require depository institutions to have due diligence procedures and, in some cases, enhanced due diligence procedures for foreign correspondent and private banking accounts; and improve information sharing between depository institutions and the U.S. government. The Bank has established policies and procedures intended to comply with these provisions.
Taxation
The Company reports its income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting. This discussion of tax matters is only a summary and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. Further discussion of income taxation is contained in Note 14 - Income Taxes of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The federal income tax laws apply to the Company in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions. The Company may exclude from income 100 percent of dividends received from the Bank and from Berkshire Insurance Group as members of the same affiliated group of corporations. The Company reports income on a calendar year basis to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Massachusetts tax law generally permits special tax treatment for a qualifying limited purpose “securities corporation.” The Bank’s securities corporations all qualify for this treatment, and are taxed at a 1.3% rate on their gross income.
