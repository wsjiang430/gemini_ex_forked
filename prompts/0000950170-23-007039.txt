 Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We own and operate one of the largest integrated equipment dealership platforms in the United States (“U.S.”) and have a presence in Canada. Through our branch network, we sell, rent, and provide parts and service support for several categories of specialized equipment, including lift trucks, heavy and compact earthmoving equipment, environmental processing equipment, and other material handling and construction equipment. We engage in five principal business activities in these equipment categories:
 (i)new equipment sales;
 (ii)used equipment sales;
 (iii)parts sales;
 (iv)repair and maintenance services; and
 (v)equipment rentals.
 Within our territories, we are the exclusive distributor of new equipment and replacement parts on behalf of our Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) partners. We and our regional subsidiaries enjoy long-standing relationships with leading material handling and construction equipment OEMs, including Hyster-Yale, Volvo, JCB and Kubota, among many others as well as master dealer rights throughout North America for environmental processing equipment with Doppstadt and Backers, among others. We are consistently recognized by OEMs as a top dealership partner and have been identified as a nationally recognized Hyster-Yale dealer and multi-year recipient of the Volvo Dealer of the Year award. More recently, the Company entered into a dealer agreement with Nikola Corporation to become the authorized dealer to sell and service Nikola medium and long-haul class 8 electric vehicle trucks in New York, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania and New England markets.
 We are committed to providing our customers with a best-in-class equipment dealership experience. Our customers are principally focused on equipment reliability and uptime, and our teams of skilled technicians and commitment to service are key to establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships, representing a critical competitive advantage. Parts and service are also our most predictable and profitable businesses, with the dealership model structured to drive aftermarket parts and service revenue. Through our new and used equipment sales and our sale of lightly used rental fleet, we populate our exclusive territories with serviceable equipment. As the field population ages, we capitalize on aftermarket parts and service sales through the equipment maintenance cycle.
 Products and Services
 New Equipment Sales. We sell new material handling, construction and environmental processing equipment and are a leading dealer for nationally recognized OEMs. Our new equipment sales generate customers for our parts sales and service operations, which grow with an expanding equipment field population in our territories. Additionally, we provide warehouse design and build services, automated equipment installation and system integration solutions within our Material Handling segment.
 Used Equipment Sales. We sell used equipment, primarily from equipment trade-ins from our new and returning customers. Used equipment sales, like new equipment sales, generate parts and services business for us.
 Parts Sales. We are the exclusive distributor of OEM parts in substantially all of our territories. Our in-house parts inventory is extensive, enabling us to provide timely service support to our customers.
 Service Support. We provide maintenance and repair services for our customers’ equipment and maintain our own rental fleet. In addition to repair and maintenance on an as needed or scheduled basis, we provide recurring maintenance services and warranty repairs for our customers.
 Equipment Rentals. We rent material handling and construction equipment to our customers. We view our rental fleet as an important component of our one-stop-shop model, and customers rely on our rental equipment to integrate into their business over the long term when flexing up their fleet capacity for a project or when customer-owned equipment is being serviced. Our rental business also supports our rent-to-sell strategy, in which we sell equipment from our rental fleet to customers who prefer to purchase lightly used equipment. As with new and used equipment sales, the rent-to-sell solution generates parts and service revenue as equipment is sold into our territories.
Industry Background
 The industries for material handling, construction and environmental processing equipment are driven by a broad range of economic factors and trends, including the ongoing transition of consumer preferences toward online retail and the associated warehousing and logistics requirements, residential, non-residential and infrastructure related construction trends, manufacturing and distribution, biofuel, composting, recycling, and general construction, material handling and eco-friendly waste solutions equipment demand. In addition, regional factors have an impact, particularly where equipment dealerships have territorial exclusivity with OEM partners.
 OEMs have pushed for consolidation in their dealership networks, and we believe that we are one of the few natural consolidators in our industry. We are one of a very limited number of public equipment dealerships, and we believe that our public profile will be a significant advantage when sourcing and competing for acquisition targets. Furthermore, many equipment dealerships are family-owned operations, and retiring management teams have struggled to develop succession plans. We are a recognized consolidator in the industry, and many incumbent dealership owners have approached our management about potential sale transactions as a result. We believe that these dynamics will contribute to a steady acquisition pipeline at attractive valuation levels.
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the following attributes are important to our ability to compete effectively and to achieve our financial objectives:
 Integrated Dealership Platform Providing Full Scale Solutions to Customers. Our integrated equipment sales, service, and rental platform provide a one-stop-shop for a highly diverse group of customers, enabling us to profitably grow our revenue throughout the years and giving us a competitive advantage over our single channel competitors and traditional equipment rental houses, which may have difficulty expanding due to the infrastructure, training, and relationships necessary to support a growing population of equipment in a designated territory and that typically have limited parts and service offerings. With our over 70 dealership locations, we believe that our scale will help us be the leading provider of material handling, construction, and environmental processing equipment and aftermarket parts and service support in each of our territories.
 Superior Parts and Services Operations Supporting Customer Relationships. We provide parts and service to our customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Our parts and service capabilities support customers in maximizing equipment uptime, which we believe is a key consideration when an equipment customer is making a selection among competing product offerings. The aftermarket parts and service businesses provide us with a predictable, high-margin revenue source that is relatively insulated from the typical business cycle.
 Ability to Attract and Retain Skilled Technical Employees. We believe that we provide best-in-class parts and service support to our customers, and the ability to attract and retain skilled technicians is critical to aftermarket performance. We have partnered with trade and technical schools in all of our territories and these relationships, along with our recruiting prowess, provide us with a pipeline of skilled employees. To retain employees, we offer attractive benefits, clean facilities with the most advanced diagnostic software, modern tools and OEM parts. Above all, we view our technicians as key contributors to future success, and we accord respect to our skilled technicians.
 Leading Dealer for Equipment Manufacturers. We are a leading U.S. dealer for many nationally recognized material handling, construction, and environmental processing equipment OEMs, including Hyster-Yale, Volvo, JCB, Kubota and Doppstadt. Our primary dealer agreements grant us exclusivity for new equipment, replacement part sales, and diagnostic service software in our territories. The OEM relationships also promote our acquisition strategy, as the OEMs prefer to partner with fewer, larger financially stable dealerships and view us as a prominent consolidator.
 High-Quality Rental Fleet for Rent-to-Sell and Rent-to-Rent Programs. Equipment rental is complementary to our new and used equipment sales and is an important component of our one-stop-shop model. Rental operations are fully aligned with our dealership strategy, as the rent-to-sell solution provides an additional sales channel by which we are able to populate our territories with equipment and generate high-margin parts and service revenue thereafter. In addition, our existing equipment customers rely on our rental fleet when facing short-term equipment needs and when customer equipment is being serviced.
 Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team is led by Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") Ryan Greenawalt, Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") Anthony Colucci and Chief Operating Officer ("COO") Craig Brubaker, each of whom has substantial experience in the equipment distribution industry. Our senior leadership is well known and highly respected in the industry. Industry relationships provide a meaningful portion of our acquisition pipeline, as dealership owners frequently approach our management team to discuss a sale. Additionally, our senior leadership team is experienced in managing our business throughout the business cycle.
Business Strategy
 We employ the following business strategies:
 Align with World-Class Original Equipment Manufacturers by Securing Dealership Agreements for Exclusive Territories. We contractually agree with best-in-class material handling and construction equipment OEMs to represent them exclusively in designated territories (i.e. a state or province). These exclusive agreements allow us to take a long-term view to a given market place, build a complementary product offering which drives market share with customers and ultimately allows us, and our OEMs, to focus on growing market share within the territory. Importantly, these agreements give us exclusive rights to purchase OEM parts and the access to OEM software which allows us to safely and effectively repair our customers equipment.
 Grow the Field Population of Equipment in Our Territories and Leverage that Equipment to Grow Parts and Service Revenue. We actively populate our territories with new and used equipment, which generates predictable, high-margin parts and service revenue. We follow this strategy with each of our acquisitions into new territories and with new OEM partnerships, growing the field population of equipment through our new, used, and rent-to-sell sales channels upon market entry. As a result, we expect future benefits from increasing aftermarket parts and service revenue driven by the equipment maintenance cycle.
 Recruit Skilled Technicians to Expand the Parts and Service Operations. We depend on our teams of technicians to provide customers with best-in-class parts and service support, and we have developed a multifaceted strategy to recruit skilled mechanics. We regularly hire mechanics away from independent rental or service businesses in our markets, where a lack of access to OEM parts and diagnostic tools make servicing increasingly sophisticated equipment difficult. Additionally, we have been successful in hiring skilled technicians from other industries, such as the automotive industry. Also, our partnerships with technical schools and community colleges provide consistent access to new technicians. We intend to replicate this strategy as we acquire additional dealership territories.
 Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. Our management team has successfully completed over 25 acquisitions. We have two primary areas of focus when pursuing acquisitions:
 •Territory In-Fill. Within our existing territories, we pursue acquisitions that may provide for new OEM relationships whose equipment will complement the existing product portfolio in a territory, new customer relationships and pools of skilled technicians. These acquisitions advance the parts and service strategy by simultaneously increasing the field population within the existing territory and expanding the number of skilled technicians to generate predictable, high-margin service and parts revenue.
 •Territorial Expansion. Our geographic footprint has grown through acquisitions, from our original Michigan lift truck territory to a leading equipment dealer with operations in the Midwest, New York, New England, Florida, parts of Ontario and Quebec. In selecting additional territories for acquisition, we prioritize opportunities that can be improved by our systems and processes and/or markets with a high density of equipment users.
 Pursue Synergistic Verticals. With our existing expertise with commercial equipment dealerships, we pursue strategic opportunities to leverage our knowledge in operating equipment dealerships to grow into other tangential verticals of commercial equipment of over-the-road vehicles. As an example, to leverage our prowess in e-mobility and meet the growing demand for commercial electric vehicles within our existing territories, we have entered the over-the-road vehicle dealership industry by virtue of our new partnership with Nikola. Similarly, with our historic success and customer relationships in equipment distribution for OEMs in exclusive territories, we will pursue growth opportunities in the wholesale equipment distribution sector, where we look to contractually possess master dealer rights for to distribute OEM equipment in a significant geographic territory (e.g. North America). Our recent acquisition of Ecoverse Industries, LTD ("Ecoverse") represents our entrance into the wholesale equipment distribution sector.
 Customers
 Our customer end markets include diversified manufacturing, food and beverage, wholesale/retail, distribution, construction, automotive, municipal/government, and medical. Our customers vary from small, single machine owners to large construction contractors and leading multi-national commercial companies. In 2022, no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our total revenues. Our top ten customers combined accounted for approximately 5% of our total revenues in 2022.
Floorplan Financing
 New equipment inventory is primarily financed with OEM floorplan facilities with an initial promotional period that is either subsidized or interest-free. OEMs provide this financing to enable dealers to carry equipment in anticipation of customer orders and to increase market share. In many cases we sell the equipment financed by its floorplan facilities before the expiration of the promotional

interest period. We view floorplan financing on new equipment inventory that is less than a year old as a component of our working capital, and do not consider floorplan financing on new equipment as part of our corporate indebtedness.
 Sales and Marketing
 We have organized our sales forces to be aligned around specific equipment types. We believe specialized sales forces for types of equipment allows our sales teams to develop expertise in certain end markets which allow them to effectively meet the demands of our diverse customer base. We have commission-based compensation programs for our sales forces.
 We provide extensive training, including frequent factory and in-house training by OEM representatives regarding the operational features of our equipment to further develop our sales team’s knowledge and experience. This training is essential, as our sales personnel regularly call on customers’ job sites and facilities, often assisting customers in assessing their immediate and ongoing equipment needs.
 We utilize a customized Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) tool, called e-Emphasys, which includes a sophisticated customer relationship management ("CRM") functionality. e-Emphasys was designed specifically for equipment dealerships. We believe that our ERP and its CRM enhances our territory management capabilities by increasing the productivity of our sales teams and by tracking equipment service history to advance our customer support goals.
 While our specialized, well-trained sales force strengthens our customer relationships and fosters customer loyalty, we also promote our business through marketing and advertising, including industry publications, digital marketing, direct mail campaigns, television and radio, and our website at www.altaequipment.com. The information contained on such websites is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual report on Form 10-K or any other public filing made with the SEC. Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $5.4 million $5.5 million, and $3.5 million respectively.
 Suppliers
 We purchase a significant amount of equipment and parts from a large number of manufacturers with whom we have distribution agreements. We purchased approximately 43% of our new equipment, rental fleet, and replacement parts from four major OEMs (Hyster-Yale, Kubota, JCB and Volvo) during the year ended December 31, 2022. Notably, we are the exclusive OEM replacement part distributor in substantially all of our territories, allowing us to provide superior service support to our customers from an aftermarket perspective.
Information Technology ("IT") Systems
 Among other metrics, our information systems track rental inventory and labor utilization statistics, and detailed operational and financial information. Our integrated services platform enables us to closely monitor our performance and our business. Our point-of-sale system enables us to link all of our facilities, permitting universal access to real-time data concerning equipment located at the individual facility locations and the rental status and maintenance history for each piece of equipment. Our business system is a full suite of highly integrated software solutions intended to manage equipment dealership activities at all essential levels. Real-time data and analytics provide detailed visibility to information across all functional areas, promoting proactive, data-driven decisions. Over 75 points of integration with our OEMs have been implemented which have greatly streamlined activities in the areas of parts inventory management and pricing, warranty claims handling, accounts payable automation, and supporting commercial credit accounts. Additional operational efficiencies are gained through our use of integrated solutions such as electronic document management, service scheduling and technician dispatch, mobile field service, and mobile equipment inspection. Analytics are provided through a data warehouse which is tightly integrated with the business system, providing real-time reports and key performance indicator dashboards that are tailored to meet the specific needs of each department and region.
 Our CRM system provides sales and customer information, available rental fleet and inventory information, a quote system and other organizational tools to assist our sales forces. We maintain an extensive customer database which allows us to monitor the status and maintenance history of our customers’ owned equipment and enables us to more effectively provide parts and services to meet their needs. Our critical systems run on servers and other equipment that represents current technology from reputable suppliers and is serviced through existing maintenance agreements.
 Product Warranties
 Product warranties for new equipment and parts are provided by our OEM partners. The term and scope of these warranties vary greatly by supplier and by product. The OEMs pay us for repairs we perform on equipment under warranty in our territories.
Seasonality
 The demand for our construction equipment tends to be lower in the winter months, and equipment rental performance will generally correlate to the levels of current construction activities, so the severity of weather conditions can have an impact on our business, especially in our Northern territories.
 Parts and services activities are less affected by changes in demand caused by seasonality, especially in our material handling segment, and are highly predictable based on historical maintenance and service trends as equipment ages.
 Competition
 The material handling and construction equipment sales and distribution industries are competitive and remain fragmented, with large numbers of competitors operating on a regional or local scale. Within our territories, our competitors range from multi-location, regional operators to single-location dealers of competing equipment brands. We compete with other equipment dealers that sell other brands of equipment that we do not represent or that we do not represent in a particular market. We also compete with local and nationwide rental businesses in certain product categories.
 Competition among equipment dealers, whether they offer material handling or construction equipment or both, is primarily based on customer service, including repair and maintenance service provided by the dealer, reputation of the OEM and dealer, quality and design of the products, and price. In our experience, reliability and uptime are the key considerations for customers in selecting a material handling and construction equipment dealer, and we believe that our focus on parts and service support has helped us win and maintain customer business. In contrast, price is not typically a customer’s key point of differentiation in selecting among competing equipment, as OEM partners often provide pricing flexibility and discounting in order to drive market share.
 Within substantially all of our territories, we are the exclusive distributor of new equipment and replacement parts on behalf of our OEM partners. This exclusivity affords us effectively no competition from others when selling these brands in our territories.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
 Our facilities and operations are subject to various, comprehensive, and frequently changing federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the U.S. These requirements govern, among other things, the handling, storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and, if any, the associated cleanup of properties affected by discharges, releases, or exposure to pollutants, air quality (emissions) and wastewater, as well as the protection of human health and safety. We do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or competitive position as a result of our compliance with such requirements. We will continue to take necessary steps to comply with environmental requirements, but we do not expect to incur material capital or other expenditures for environmental controls or compliance.
Human Capital
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,800 employees. Of these employees, approximately 1,150 are skilled technicians paid on an hourly basis and the remainder are hourly and salaried corporate, sales, operating, and administrative personnel. We have approximately 550 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relations with our employees are good, and we have never experienced a long-term work stoppage. We are committed to fostering a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment and have instituted various initiatives to increase our diversity as it relates to recruiting and training opportunities.
 Generally, the total number of employees does not significantly fluctuate throughout the year. However, acquisition activity may increase the number of our employees. Fluctuations in the level of our business activity could require some staffing level adjustments in response to actual or anticipated customer demand.
Health and Safety
 The health and safety of our employees is an important focus at Alta. As part of our continuing goal to reduce our recordable injuries, we are committed to regularly reinforcing the importance of our safety programs and encouraging a culture of safe work practices in all of our locations. As part of our evaluation of our management employees, we evaluate the safety records of the employees for whom they have management responsibility.
Talent Development and Employee Training
 Our goal is to attract, develop, and retain a talented and high-performing workforce. We are committed to our employees and their development, and we strive to create opportunities for the continual professional development of our employee base. These opportunities include continuing education and specialty training.
Compensation and Benefits
 We are committed to providing competitive compensation and benefits programs for our employees as we believe competitive compensation arrangements are core to an engaged and productive employee base. We believe our compensation programs align both individual and team contributions to promote our culture and drive our performance. Substantially all of the Company’s employees are eligible to participate in the Company’s 401(k) and profit-sharing plan. Eligible employees may contribute a percentage of their salary up to the Internal Revenue Service limit. The Company may contribute a discretionary percentage of the amount deferred by the employee. Total contributions made by the Company to the 401(k) plan amounted to approximately $4.0 million, $3.9 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022, our stockholders approved an Employee Stock Purchase Program ("ESPP") which is expected become effective in 2023.
