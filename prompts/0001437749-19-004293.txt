ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
References herein to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Plumas Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiary, unless the context indicates otherwise. References to the “Bank” refer to Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Plumas Bank. References to “Management” refer to the members of the Company’s management and references to the “Board of Directors” or the “Board” refer to the Company’s Board of Directors.
 
General
 
The Company.  Plumas Bancorp is a California corporation registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is headquartered in Quincy, California.  The Company was incorporated in January 2002 for the purposes of become Plumas Bank’s holding company and acquired all of the outstanding shares of the Bank in June 2002.  The Company’s principal subsidiary is the Bank, and the Company exists primarily for the purpose of holding the stock of the Bank and of such other subsidiaries it may acquire or establish.  At the present time, the Company’s only other subsidiaries are Plumas Statutory Trust I and Plumas Statutory Trust II, which were formed in 2002 and 2005 solely to facilitate the issuance of trust preferred securities.
 
The Company’s principal source of income is dividends from the Bank, but the Company may explore supplemental sources of income in the future.  The cash outlays of the Company, including (but not limited to) the payment of dividends to shareholders, if and when declared by the Board of Directors, costs of repurchasing Company common stock and the cost of servicing debt, will generally be paid from dividends paid to the Company by the Bank.
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company had consolidated assets of $824.4 million, deposits of $726.6 million, other liabilities of $30.9 million and shareholders’ equity of $66.9 million.  The Company’s other liabilities include $10.3 million in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures and $13.1 million in repurchase agreements. These items are described in detail later in this Form 10-K.
 
Our operations are conducted at 35 South Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California. Our annual, quarterly and other reports, required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (the “SEC”) are posted and are available at no cost on the Company’s website, www.plumasbank.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company files such documents with the SEC. These reports are also available through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
 
The Bank. The Bank is a California state-chartered bank that was incorporated in July 1980 and opened for business in December 1980.  The Bank’s deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) up to maximum insurable amounts. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank’s Administrative Office is located at 35 South Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California.  At December 31, 2018 the Bank had approximately $824 million in assets, $562 million in net loans and $727 million in deposits (including deposits of $0.5 million from the Company).  It is currently the largest independent bank headquartered in Plumas County. 
 
The Bank’s primary service area covers the Northeastern portion of California, with Lake Tahoe to the south and the Oregon border to the north. The Bank, through its thirteen-branch network, serves Washoe and Carson City counties in Nevada and the seven contiguous California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Sierra, Placer, Lassen, Modoc and Shasta. The branches are located in the California communities of Quincy, Portola, Greenville, Truckee, Fall River Mills, Alturas, Susanville, Chester, Tahoe City, Kings Beach and Redding; in addition, during December 2015 the Bank opened a branch in Reno, Nevada and effective October 26, 2018 purchased a branch in Carson City, Nevada. The Bank maintains seventeen automated teller machines (“ATMs”) tied in with major statewide and national networks. In addition to its branch network, the Bank operates a lending office specializing in government-guaranteed lending in Auburn, California and commercial/agricultural lending offices located in Chico, California, Red Bluff, California and Klamath Falls, Oregon. The Bank’s primary business is servicing the banking needs of these communities. Its marketing strategy stresses its local ownership and commitment to serve the banking needs of individuals living and working in the Bank’s primary service areas.
 
With a predominant focus on personal service, the Bank has positioned itself as a multi-community independent bank serving the financial needs of individuals and businesses within the Bank’s geographic footprint.  Our principal retail lending services include consumer, automobile and home equity loans. Our principal commercial lending services include term real estate, commercial and industrial term loans. In addition, we provide government-guaranteed and agricultural loans as well as credit lines. We provide land development and construction loans on a limited basis.

The Bank’s government-guaranteed lending center headquartered in Auburn, California provides Small Business Administration (SBA) and USDA Rural Development loans to qualified borrowers throughout Northern California, and Northern Nevada.  During 2007 the Bank was granted nationwide Preferred Lender status with the U.S. Small Business Administration and we expect government-guaranteed lending to continue to be an important part of our overall lending operation. During 2018 proceeds from the sale of government-guaranteed loans totaled $41.7 million and we generated a gain on sale of $1.9 million. During 2017 proceeds from the sale of government-guaranteed loans totaled $36.6 million and we generated a gain on sale of $2.0 million.
 
The Agricultural Credit Centers located in Alturas, Chico, Red Bluff and Susanville, California and Klamath Falls, Oregon provide a complete line of credit services in support of the agricultural activities which are key to the continued economic development of the communities we serve.  “Ag lending” clients include a full range of individual farming customers, small to medium-sized business farming organizations and corporate farming units.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the principal areas to which we have directed our lending activities, and the percentage of our total loan portfolio comprised by each, were as follows: (i) commercial real estate – 48.0%; (ii) consumer loans (including residential equity lines of credit and automobile loans) – 21.1%; (iii) agricultural loans (including agricultural real estate loans) – 12.2%; (iv); commercial and industrial loans – 8.8%; (v) construction and land development – 7.1%; and (vi) residential real estate – 2.8% .
 
In addition to the lending activities noted above, we offer a wide range of deposit products for the retail and commercial banking markets including checking, interest-bearing and premium interest-bearing checking, business sweep, public funds sweep, savings, time deposit and retirement accounts, as well as remote deposit, telephone and mobile banking, including mobile deposit, and internet banking with bill-pay options. Interest bearing deposits include high yield sweep accounts designed for our commercial customers and for public entities such as municipalities. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had 33,058 deposit accounts with balances totaling approximately $727 million, compared to 31,582 deposit accounts with balances totaling approximately $663 million at December 31, 2017.  We attract deposits through our customer-oriented product mix, competitive pricing, convenient locations, mobile and internet banking and remote deposit operations, all provided with a high level of customer service.
 
Most of our deposits are attracted from individuals, business-related sources and smaller municipal entities.  This mix of deposit customers resulted in a relatively modest average deposit balance of approximately $22 thousand at December 31, 2018. However, it makes us less vulnerable to adverse effects from the loss of depositors who may be seeking higher yields in other markets or who may otherwise draw down balances for cash needs.
 
We also offer a variety of other products and services to complement the lending and deposit services previously reviewed.  These include cashier’s checks, bank-by-mail, ATMs, night depository, safe deposit boxes, direct deposit, electronic funds transfers and other customary banking services.
 
Through our offering of a Remote Deposit product our business customers are able to make non-cash deposits remotely from their physical location. With this product, we have extended our service area and can now meet the deposit needs of customers who may not be located within a convenient distance of one of our branch offices.
 
The Bank has devoted a substantial amount of time and capital to the improvement of existing Bank services. We added mobile banking services during the first quarter of 2010. During 2015 we enhanced our mobile banking services and began offering mobile deposit services. During the first quarter of 2012 we replaced our ATMs with new state of the art machines that are ADA compliant and capable of accepting check and cash deposits without a deposit envelope. During 2015 we enhanced our mobile banking services and began offering mobile deposit services and in 2018 we began offering the ability for our customers to send money to others from their mobile devices through a linked debit card (“P2P” transfers).
 
The officers and employees of the Bank are continually engaged in marketing activities, including the evaluation and development of new products and services, to enable the Bank to retain and improve its competitive position in its service area. 
 
We hold no patents or licenses (other than licenses required by appropriate bank regulatory agencies or local governments), franchises, or concessions.  Our business has a modest seasonal component due to the heavy agricultural and tourism orientation of some of the communities we serve.  We are not dependent on a single customer or group of related customers for a material portion of our deposits. The Company’s management has established loan concentration guidelines as a percentage of capital and evaluates loan concentration levels within a single industry or group of related industries on quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change. There has been no material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position as a result of federal, state, or local environmental regulation.

Commitment to our Communities. The Board of Directors and Management believe that the Company plays an important role in the economic well-being of the communities it serves. Our Bank has a continuing responsibility to provide a wide range of lending and deposit services to both individuals and businesses. These services are tailored to meet the needs of the communities served by the Company and the Bank.
 
We offer various loan products which encourage job growth and support community economic development. Types of loans offered range from personal and commercial loans to real estate, construction, agricultural, automobile and government-guaranteed loans. Many banking decisions are made locally with the goal of maintaining customer satisfaction through the timely delivery of high quality products and services.
 
Recent Expansion Activities. On July 31, 2015 the Bank completed its acquisition of the Redding, California, branch of Rabobank N.A. The transaction included the acquisition of approximately $10 million in deposits. The branch, located at 1335 Hilltop Dr. in Redding, now operates as a branch of the Bank. Following the acquisition, the Bank consolidated its preexisting branch Redding branch on Civic Center Drive branch into this location. The Civic Center Drive facility was sold to an unrelated third party in December 2015.
 
In December 2015 the Bank opened a full-service branch located at 5050 Meadowood Mall Circle, Reno, Nevada. This was the Bank’s first branch location outside of California. On October 26, 2018 we acquired a branch located in Carson City, Nevada from Mutual of Omaha Bank. This transaction resulted in the acquisition of $45.6 million in deposits and $1.8 million in loans and the recording of $1.1 million in intangible assets.
 
Dividends. It is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors. On October 20, 2016 the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of a semi-annual cash dividend. The dividend in the amount of $0.10 per share was paid on November 21, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business day on November 7, 2016. A semi-annual cash dividend totaling $0.14 per share was paid on May 15, 2017 and November 15, 2017 and a semi-annual cash dividend totaling $0.18 per share was paid on May 15, 2018 and November 15, 2018.
Trust Preferred Securities. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company formed a wholly owned Connecticut statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust I (the “Trust I”). On September 26, 2002, the Company issued to the Trust I, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2032 (the “Debentures”) in the aggregate principal amount of $6,186,000. In exchange for these debentures the Trust I paid the Company $6,186,000. The Trust I funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $6,000,000 in floating rate capital securities (“trust preferred securities”), which were sold to a third party. These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines. The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust I. The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same. The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 3.40%, not to exceed 11.9%, adjustable quarterly. The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
 
During the third quarter of 2005, the Company formed a wholly owned Delaware statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust II (the “Trust II”). On September 28, 2005, the Company issued to the Trust II, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2035 (the “Debentures”) in the aggregate principal amount of $4,124,000. In exchange for these debentures the Trust II paid the Company $4,124,000. The Trust II funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $4,000,000 in floating rate capital securities (“trust preferred securities”), which were sold to a third party. These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines. The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust II. The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same. The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 1.48%, adjustable quarterly. The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank.
 
The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the Debentures on September 26, 2032 for Trust I and September 28, 2035 for Trust II, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) excludes trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, from being included in Tier 1 capital, unless the issuing company is a bank holding company with less than $500 million in total assets. Trust preferred securities issued prior to that date will continue to count as Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets, such as the Company.

Neither Trust I nor Trust II are consolidated into the Company’s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, both entities are accounted for under the equity method and the junior subordinated debentures are reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
 
Business Concentrations.  No individual or single group of related customer accounts is considered material in relation to the Bank's assets or deposits, or in relation to our overall business. However, at December 31, 2018 approximately 71% of the Bank's total loan portfolio consisted of real estate-secured loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate. Moreover, our business activities are currently focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta and Sierra and Washoe and Carson City Counties in Nevada. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. In addition, the concentration of our operations in these areas of California and Nevada exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires, drought and floods in these regions in California and Nevada.
Competition. The banking business is highly competitive. The business is largely dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographical area.  These banks have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand.  Many of the major banks operating in the area offer certain services that we do not offer directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions.  By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such banks also have substantially higher lending limits than we do.  For customers whose loan demands exceed our legal lending limit, we attempt to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with correspondent or other banks.
 
In addition to other banks, our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, Internet-based lending platforms and investment banking firms.  In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal financial software.  Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers.  Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional competitive pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues.  Competition has also intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws enacted in the mid-1990’s, which permit banking organizations to expand into other states. The relatively large California market has been particularly attractive to out-of-state institutions.  The Financial Modernization Act, which became effective March 11, 2000, has made it possible for full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies, and has also intensified competitive conditions.
 
Currently, within towns in which the Bank has a branch, excluding Carson City, there are 106 banking branch offices of competing institutions (excluding credit unions, but including savings banks), including 69 branches of 11 banks having assets more than $10 billion. As of June 30, 2018, the FDIC estimated the Bank’s market share of insured deposits within the communities it serves to be as follows: Greenville and Portola 100%, Quincy 86%, Chester 66%, Alturas 59%, Fall River Mills 36%, Kings Beach 32%, Susanville 43%, Truckee 14%, Tahoe City 22%, Redding 1% and Reno less than 1%.
 
Technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in financial services markets.  Such innovation has, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously were considered traditional banking products.  In addition, many customers now expect a choice of delivery systems and channels, including home computer, mobile, remote deposit, telephone, ATMs, mail, full-service branches and/or in-store branches.  The sources of competition in such products include traditional banks as well as savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, money market and other mutual funds, asset management groups, finance and insurance companies, internet-only financial intermediaries, and mortgage banking firms.
 
For many years we have countered rising competition by providing our own style of community-oriented, personalized service.  We rely on local promotional activity, personal contacts by our officers, directors, employees, and shareholders, automated 24-hour banking, and the individualized service that we can provide through our flexible policies.  This approach appears to be well-received by our customers who appreciate a more personal and customer-oriented environment in which to conduct their financial transactions. To meet the needs of customers who prefer to bank electronically, we offer telephone banking, mobile banking, remote deposit, mobile deposit and internet banking with bill payment capabilities.  This high tech and high touch approach allows the customers to tailor their access to our services based on their particular preference.

Employees. At December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiary employed 174 persons. On a full-time equivalent basis, we employed 155 persons. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union, and management considers its relations with employees to be good.
Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers (including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer) and financial personnel, known as the Corporate Governance Code of Ethics. This Code of Ethics is available on the Company’s website at www.plumasbank.com. Shareholders may request a free copy of the Code of Ethics Policy from Plumas Bancorp, Ms. Elizabeth Kuipers, Investor Relations, 35 S. Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California 95971.
Supervision and Regulation
 
General. As banking institution, we are extensively regulated under federal and state law. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and customers, not our shareholders. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation. Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and by the policies of various regulatory authorities. Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects. We cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation may have in the future.
Holding Company Regulation. We are a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and are subject to the supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”). We are required to file reports with the FRB and the FRB periodically examines the Company. A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank. FRB regulations require the Company to meet or exceed certain capital requirements and regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt. The Company is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code. Therefore, the Company and any of its subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the California Department of Business Oversight (“DBO”).
 
The activities of bank holding companies are generally limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies that qualify and register as “financial holding companies” are also able to engage in certain additional financial activities, such as merchant banking and securities and insurance underwriting, subject to limitations set forth in federal law. The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company. As a bank holding company, the Company must to obtain prior approval of the FRB before taking any action that causes a bank to become a controlled subsidiary of the bank holding company; acquiring direct or indirect ownership 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities another bank or bank holding company, acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. 
 
Federal and State Bank Regulation. As a California-chartered commercial bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, the Bank is subject to the supervision and regulation of the DBO and the FDIC, as well as certain of the regulations of the FRB and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The DBO and the FDIC regularly examine the Bank and may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law.
Securities Regulation. The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a listed company on NASDAQ, we are subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies.
Capital Adequacy. The FDIC has risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization’s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are reported as off-balance-sheet items. Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance-sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain U.S. government securities, to 100% for assets with relatively higher credit risk, such as business loans.

A banking organization’s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items. The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital. Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets. Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity. The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies.
 
In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for U.S. banks, sometimes called “Basel III”. The phase-in period for the final rules began in 2015, with certain of the rules’ requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule. Under the final rules minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank. The new capital rules include a new minimum “common equity Tier 1” ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets). The effective date of these requirements was January 1, 2015. In addition, the new capital rules include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these levels (to be phased in over three years which beginning at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until reaching 2.5% on January 1, 2019) will be required for banking institutions to avoid restrictions on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or pay discretionary bonuses. When fully phased in and including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the new capital rules would result in the following minimum ratios for the Bank to be considered well capitalized: (i) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments.
 
Under the new capital rules, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 (including the capital conservation buffer as then phased in) were as follows: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.375%; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.875%; a total capital risk-based capital ratio of 9.875% and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%.
 
A bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the FDIC and/or the DBO to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company and any other company deemed to control the bank must guarantee the performance of that plan. Under current regulations, a depository institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s capital ratios exceed the thresholds necessary to be considered “well capitalized.”
 
Under the FRB’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Regulation Y, Appendix C) (the “Policy Statement”), certain bank holding companies with less than $1 billion in consolidated assets are exempt from the consolidated capital rules. The Company qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is not currently subject to consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Relief Act”) was signed into law. The Relief Act included a provision to increase the threshold for qualifying for the Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion in total assets.
 
The new capital rules continue to apply to the Bank. Consistent with the Relief Act, however, the federal banking agencies have proposed a new community bank leverage ratio that is intended to simply the regulatory capital requirements for qualifying community banking organizations. Under the proposal, a qualifying banking organization that so elects would be deemed to have met the well-capital capitalized ratio requirements under the prompt corrective action framework and would be exempt from the generally applicable new capital rules if it maintains a new “community bank leverage ratio” in excess of 9%. The proposed community bank leverage ratio would be equal to tangible equity (as defined the proposal) divided by average total consolidated assets. To qualify, a banking organization would have to have less than $10 billion in assets and limited off balance sheet exposures and other assets. We cannot predict whether or when this proposal will be adopted.

Dividends. The Company's ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on dividends paid to it by the Bank and limited by California law. Under California law, the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions. The California General Corporation Law permits a California corporation such as the Company to make a distribution to its shareholders if its retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed distribution or if after giving effect to the distribution, the value of the corporation’s assets exceed the amount of its liabilities plus the amount of shareholders preferences, if any, and certain other conditions are met.
 
It is the Federal Reserve’s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings support the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. Further, it is the FRB’s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve also discourages dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.
 
In addition, the Company’s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to the trust preferred securities issued by the Company’s business trust subsidiaries.
 
The Bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company. The Company is dependent on the performance of the Bank for funds which may be received as dividends from the Bank for use in the operation of the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to shareholders. Future cash dividends by the Bank will also depend upon management’s assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors.
 
The California Financial Code restricts the dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company to the lesser of the Bank's retained earnings or the Bank's net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends previously declared during that period, or, with the approval of the DBO, to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year, or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year. As of December 31, 2018, the maximum amount available for dividend distribution under this restriction was approximately $21.4 million. In addition, the Bank is subject to the new capital rules and the capital conservation buffer discussed above.
 
Loans-to-One Borrower.  Under California law, the Bank’s ability to make aggregate secured and unsecured loans-to-one-borrower is limited to 25% and 15%, respectively, of unimpaired capital and surplus.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s limit on aggregate secured loans-to-one-borrower was $20.8 million and unsecured loans-to-one borrower was $12.5 million.  The Bank has established internal loan limits that are lower than the legal lending limits for a California bank.
 
The Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the federal banking regulators evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility. A less than “Satisfactory” rating would likely result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved. As of the most recent report of examination the Bank’s CRA rating was “Satisfactory.”
Transactions with Affiliates. Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders (including the Company) or any related interest of such persons. Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions.
 
The Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation W limit the amount of certain loan and investment transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for such loans, and limit the amount of advances to third parties that may be collateralized by the securities of the Company or its subsidiaries. Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies. The Company and its subsidiaries have adopted an Affiliate Transactions Policy and have entered into various affiliate agreements in compliance with Regulation W.

Safety and Soundness Standards. The FRB and the FDIC have adopted non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions. These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that it will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions.
Federal Deposit Insurance. In addition to supervising and regulating state-chartered non-member banks, the FDIC insures the Bank’s deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”), currently $250,000 per depositor per institution. The DIF is funded primarily by FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. The Bank’s FDIC insurance expense totaled $216 thousand for 2018.
 
Additionally, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. The Bank’s FICO assessments totaled $21 thousand for 2018. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2019.
 
The FDIC may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the bank’s depositors. Under California law, the termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance would result in a termination of the Bank’s charter.
 
Interstate Branching. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch. Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state. Accordingly, banks may now enter new markets more freely.
Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations. Examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature, and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the following:

● | The Equal Credit Opportunity Act generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably. As a result of the TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among other things. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, Regulation Z promulgated under the TILA includes new limits on loan originator compensation for all closed-end mortgages. These changes include, prohibiting certain payments to a mortgage broker or loan officer based on the transaction’s terms or conditions, prohibiting dual compensation, and prohibiting a mortgage broker or loan officer from ‘‘steering’’ consumers to transactions not in their interest, to increase mortgage broker or loan officer compensation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Fair Housing Act (“FH Act”) regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status. A number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FH Act, including some that are not specifically mentioned in the FH Act itself.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”), in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods, requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located. The HMDA also includes a “fair lending” aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Right to Financial Privacy Act imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers. Financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy, and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”) requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements. Also, RESPA prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines, reimbursement and other penalties. Due to heightened regulatory expectations related to compliance generally, the Company may incur additional compliance costs.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB as a new, independent federal agency. The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions, including the Bank, are generally subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes.
 
Anti-Money Laundering Laws. A series of banking laws and regulations beginning with the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970 requires banks to prevent, detect, and report illicit or illegal financial activities to the federal government to prevent money laundering, international drug trafficking, and terrorism. Under the US PATRIOT Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, requirements regarding the Customer Identification Program, as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with high risk customers, foreign financial institutions, and foreign individuals and entities.
Privacy and Data Security. The Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (“GLBA”) of 1999 imposes requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy. The GLBA generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually. The GLBA also directs federal regulators, including the FDIC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. The Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach. The Bank is required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal of information that is no longer needed. Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused.
Potential Enforcement Actions; Supervisory Agreements. Under federal law, the Company, the Bank and their institution-affiliated parties may be the subject of potential enforcement actions by the FRB (in the case of the Company) or the FDIC (in the case of the Bank) for unsafe and unsound practices in conducting their businesses, or for violations of any law, rule or regulation or provision, any consent order with any agency, any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver, cease-and-desist orders and written agreements, the termination of insurance of deposits, the imposition of civil money penalties, the payment of restitution and removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties. The DBO also has authority to bring similar enforcement actions against the Bank.
Legislation and Proposed Changes. From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, in the California legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies. Typically, the intent of this type of legislation is to strengthen the banking industry, even if it may on occasion prove to be a burden on management’s plans. No prediction can be made as to the likelihood of any major changes or the impact that new laws or regulations might have on us.

Effects of Government Monetary Policy. Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the FRB. The FRB implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the FRB, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits. These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The Company’s profitability, like most financial institutions, is primarily dependent on interest rate spreads. In general, the difference between the interest rates paid by the Bank on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates received by the Bank on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to customers and securities held in the investment portfolio, will comprise the major portion of the Company’s earnings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, recession and unemployment, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the FRB and the impact which future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on us cannot be predicted. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty.
