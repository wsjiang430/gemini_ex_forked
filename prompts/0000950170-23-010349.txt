 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
Gelesis is a commercial stage biotherapeutics company built for consumer engagement. We are focused on advancing first-in-class superabsorbent hydrogel therapeutics for chronic gastrointestinal, or GI, diseases including excess weight, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NAFLD/NASH”), functional constipation (“FC”), and inflammatory bowel disease. Our biomimetic superabsorbent hydrogels are inspired by the composition and mechanical properties (e.g. firmness) of raw vegetables. They are conveniently administered in capsules taken with water to create a much larger volume of small, non-aggregating hydrogel pieces that become an integrated part of the meals, and act locally in the digestive system.


Our first product, Plenity, and our other product candidates are based on a proprietary hydrogel technology that works mechanically, as opposed to via a chemical mode of action, and exclusively in the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract rather than systemically or through surgical intervention. Plenity is indicated for over 150 million Americans, the largest number of adults struggling with excess weight (i.e., a body mass index (kg/m2), or BMI, of 25 – 40) of any prescription oral weight-management aid and the only one indicated for the entire range of overweight population, including those without co-morbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Plenity is marketed directly to potential members, who access it through telehealth and traditional healthcare provider services. We refer to those who are prescribed Plenity as our members — not customers — because we view our relationship with them as a long-term journey of support, not as a transactional relationship. This consumer-directed model is uniquely enabled by Plenity’s strong safety and tolerability profile. Our business is built on a subscription model, as monthly Plenity kits are delivered to our members’ homes. We leverage the latest technologies with telehealth, mail-order distribution, consumer engagement, and our native digital technology platform. Plenity is an orally administered capsule that employs multiple mechanisms of action along the GI tract to aid in weight management by creating small firm 3D structures, similar to ingested raw vegetables, which create a sensation of feeling fuller. Using a biomimetic approach, we developed the first-of-its-kind superabsorbent hydrogel technology, inspired by the composition (e.g., water and cellulose) and mechanical properties (e.g. elasticity or firmness) of ingested raw vegetables. We designed Plenity and our other hydrogels to address several critical challenges of the modern diet: portion size, caloric density, and food composition. For optimal safety and efficacy, these hydrogel particles are engineered to rapidly absorb and release water at specific locations in the GI tract. Plenity does not act systemically and is not absorbed by the body. Instead, it acts locally in the GI tract by changing the volume, firmness, and reducing the caloric density of ingested meals. Because it acts mechanically and it is the first of its kind, Plenity is regulated as a novel medical device and was granted de novo authorization. In January 2023, we submitted a premarket notification, or 510(k), to the FDA to change Plenity from prescription-only to over-the-counter, or OTC, in the United States and anticipate the

FDA's decision on our 510(k) submission by the third quarter of 2023. Our product pipeline also includes multiple other potential therapeutic candidates for common chronic conditions affected by gut health that are currently in clinical and preclinical testing, including type 2 diabetes, NAFLD, NASH, and FC, all based on our hydrogel technology.
Obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases represent a global health challenge for which there are few safe and effective interventions. These conditions are associated with comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.
There are limited available treatments that address the overweight and obesity epidemic safely and effectively. Available therapies include pharmaceuticals and surgical interventions, including device implantation. These approaches are associated with safety concerns that limit their use. Conversely, we believe our hydrogel technology presents a breakthrough in material science as it is the first and only superabsorbent hydrogel that is constructed from building blocks used in foods and specifically engineered to achieve its medical purpose. Our first commercial product based on this technology, Plenity, is clinically validated and was granted de novo classification by the FDA to aid in weight management in adults with overweight or obesity, when used in conjunction with diet and exercise. The types of FDA marketing authorization available to a medical device are premarket notification (also called 510(k) when a predicate device exists) and premarket approval (also called PMA) for higher risk Class III devices. De novo classification is a pathway to market for low to medium risk novel devices for which there is no predicate.
Plenity’s de novo authorization included clinical trials and other data that demonstrated assurance of safety and effectiveness. Plenity has the broadest label of any FDA-regulated weight management approach as it is indicated for the largest number of adults struggling with excess weight, offering a safe, convenient and effective oral treatment option.
Our biomimetic hydrogel, which is engineered to rapidly absorb and release water at specific locations in the GI tract, is synthesized through a multi-step, proprietary process using a specific form of modified cellulose and citric acid, both of which are generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and are commonly used in the food industry. In our manufacturing process, we crosslink the modified cellulose with citric acid to form a three-dimensional matrix, resulting in the desired properties of Plenity. Each Plenity capsule contains thousands of hydrogel particles, with each particle approximately the size of a grain of salt. We designed the Plenity capsule to be ingested with water before a meal. In the stomach, the hydrogel particles are released from the capsules and rapidly absorb water, hydrating to approximately 100 times their original size. When fully hydrated, each gel particle is, on average, approximately 2 mm in diameter and its elastic response (a measurement of the ability of matter to recover its original shape after deformation) is similar to that of ingested raw vegetables. The hydrogel particles mix homogeneously with food and travel through the GI tract and are designed to induce satiety and improve glycemic control through multiple mechanisms of action. Once in the large intestine, the particles partially degrade and release most of the water, which is reabsorbed by the body. The remaining degraded particles are then eliminated by the body in the same manner as raw vegetables.

Our Commercial Approach
Our first product, Plenity, is a prescription therapy delivered through a direct-to-consumer approach. It is the first weight management product to provide consumer access through a telehealth platform as well as through traditional healthcare provider services at launch. Our direct-to-consumer commercial approach integrates proven traditional and online consumer marketing strategies with our synergistic partnerships in telehealth and online pharmacy industries.


By allowing consumers to seek out our product on their own time, on their own terms, and from the privacy of their homes, we aim to drive consumer demand. Through our telehealth model in partnership with leading telehealth provider Ro, consumers can initiate an evaluation with a board certified, independent physician online at any time that is convenient to them. We anticipate that some consumers will want to see their own physician to discuss Plenity. We are undertaking a physician and healthcare provider education program to drive professional awareness of Plenity.
Plenity is affordably and transparently priced at $98 for a 28-day supply ($1.75/meal). Knowing the product cost when it is prescribed by a healthcare provider, not having to deal with the hurdles and hassle of payor, co-pays or reimbursement hoops further lowers the barrier to access. We have priced Plenity at an amount we believe will allow a large portion of the 150 million target population to afford to pay for the product out of pocket. We anticipate our commercial approach will also remove the significant and ever-growing margin erosion forced on healthcare companies from payors and pharmaceutical benefit managers in order to gain access to their controlled patient pools. Our business model is driven by consumer demand with out-of-pocket consumer payment and is not dependent on reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government health programs and private insurance companies.
Obesity is a chronic medical condition and we believe people require ongoing, often long-term, support to achieve and maintain weight loss. Given its safety profile and broad FDA label, Plenity can be taken without limitation to duration of therapy — addressing this long-term challenge. We view our relationship with our members as long term and anticipate that some people will take Plenity chronically, and some will stop or pause treatment. Based on the data we have collected, 70% of consumers responded that they would try Plenity again.
Pricing & Availability
Plenity is available by prescription via a telehealth consultation with a physician trained in weight management support, with free, unlimited follow-up visits as needed. Consumers may visit myplenity.com to start their online consultations or speak with their physician to determine if the Plenity prescription therapy is their best treatment option. A Plenity subscription costs $98 for a four-week supply ($1.75 per meal). Members may pause their subscription or delay shipment at any time.
Manufacturing
 Manufacturing the superabsorbent hydrogel used in Plenity and our other product candidates is a unique, proprietary process that is performed in-house by our subsidiary, Gelesis S.r.l., located in Italy. During 2020, we completed a limited manufacturing scale-up to enable the beta launch of Plenity in the U.S. market, while simultaneously constructing state-of-the-art commercial-scale facilities to enable the full launch of Plenity. Production at our first commercial-scale manufacturing facility commenced in the fourth quarter of 2021, with the facility designed to accommodate three commercial-scale manufacturing lines, which is equivalent to an aggregate manufacturing capacity of approximately 480,000 Plenity 28-day supply units produced on a monthly basis when development is complete.
In addition to our existing know-how in manufacturing superabsorbent hydrogels, we continue to seek improvements in manufacturing efficiency through research and development in material science and commercial-scale real-world optimization. To date, we have invested over $50 million in commercial manufacturing capabilities. We are currently capable of producing up to 80,000 Plenity 28-day supply units on a monthly basis, and we expect we will be able to produce up to 160,000 Plenity 28-day supply units on a monthly basis by the second quarter of 2023, with capability to scale-up to 320,000 Plenity 28-day supply units on a monthly basis by the fourth quarter of 2023, and reaching full capacity of 480,000 Plenity 28-day supply units on a monthly basis by the end of 2024. We also own land to build a second commercial-scale manufacturing facility. Our second commercial-scale facility is designed to accommodate six commercial-scale manufacturing lines, which is equivalent to an aggregate manufacturing capacity of approximately 960,000 Plenity 28-day supply units produced on a monthly basis when development is complete. Future development of our manufacturing facilities, including planned increases in capacity, is contingent on the timing and magnitude of additional fundraising as well the demand for and sales of Plenity.
 We engage contract-manufacturing organizations in North America to perform ancillary finished-good packaging services as a means of controlling costs and enabling growth capabilities.
Our Competitive Strengths
•Unmet Need. In the United States, roughly 7 out of 10 Americans struggle with their weight. Our first product, Plenity, is indicated for the largest number of adults struggling with their weight (approximately 150 million Americans) as compared to any other weight management prescription product and has no limitation on duration of therapy. Seventy percent (70%) of our members have never tried a prescription weight management product before, indicating Plenity is bringing new people into the category of prescription weight management products. 
 •Attractive Efficacy and Safety Profile. In clinical trials, six out of ten people achieved clinically meaningful weight loss in six months on Plenity, averaging a loss 10% of their total body weight (or an average of 22 pounds), with a side effect profile similar to placebo, and no serious adverse events. 
 The strong safety, efficacy, and tolerability profile of Plenity provides a clinically validated option as a first line of defense after diet and exercise for people who are just overweight, before the onset of obesity, many of whom did not have any prescription option before.
•Consumer Focus and Engagement. We leverage telehealth and traditional healthcare to provide members with easy access to Plenity. We have developed the infrastructure to directly engage with our members in a digital ecosystem designed to also provide behavioral and educational support for our members’ weight loss journey. Through our platform we provide our members with immediate access to physicians with real-time communications through telehealth. We believe this consumer-focused approach empowers our members to improve and change their diet, lifestyle and health. We offer our members transparent pricing and home delivery with two-day pharmacy direct shipping. Our reliance on direct-to-consumer marketing as our primary demand driver should allow us to improve the efficiency of our sales force investments. The consumer pull created reduces the need for typical high healthcare provider, or HCP, call frequencies and allows for efficient use of a limited sales force. 
 •Proven Early Success. Our broad launch successfully demonstrated that the product profile resonates with users, and we believe that it indicates strong future demand for Plenity given a broad label in the underserved weight loss market. As weight management is a chronic medical condition, we see the potential for long-lived, recurring revenues if consumers make Plenity a part of their everyday weight management routine. 
 •Global Scalability. Worldwide, more than 1.9 billion adults aged 18 years and older have unhealthy weight and of these over 650 million adults are classified as having obesity. We believe our commercial infrastructure is purpose-built to scale quickly and efficiently to accommodate new geographies. We have partnered with China Medical System Holdings Limited for commercialization of Plenity in Greater China (including Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, 


and Taiwan), Singapore and United Arab Emirates. With our CE Mark authorization for Plenity in Europe, we intend to pursue expansion through strategic partnerships or direct commercialization.
•Profit Margin Potential. We believe that our proprietary manufacturing process and agile distribution and supply chain networks will provide sustainable profit margins. 
 •New Product Pipeline. We believe that our superabsorbent hydrogel technology can address large patient populations with chronic conditions related to obesity and have a pipeline of product candidates which we expect to advance through the FDA’s de novo classification or 510(k) pathways as clinical data become available. We are developing manufacturing capacity for our hydrogels using a novel, proprietary process which we perform at our own facilities. We have nine families of patents and more than 130 individual patents and patent applications directed to compositions of matter and methods of production for Plenity, other product candidates and our hydrogel technology as well as methods of use for certain hydrogels. 
 •Management Team. We are a founder-led team that combines innovative scientific thinkers and proven industry leaders in research and discovery, clinical development and product approval, and consumer driven commercialization. 
 Market Overview
Global Epidemic: Overweight and Obesity
Obesity is a serious medical condition that is growing rapidly in prevalence worldwide. It has been designated by the American Medical Association, or AMA, as a “multi-metabolic and hormonal disease state.” Between 1988 and 1994, 23% of adults in the United States 20 years of age and older, or approximately 40 million, had obesity according to a CDC report. However, between 2017-2018, this number had risen to 42.5% or approximately 105 million, representing a 263% increase. Furthermore, the CDC reported that an additional 31% of adults in the United States 20 years of age and older, or approximately 75 million, were overweight, with many of these individuals expected to cross the threshold into obesity in the near future. Globally, there were more than 1.9 billion adults 18 years of age and older that had an unhealthy weight, of which approximately 650 million in 2016 had obesity, according to the WHO.
In addition to the adult population, the pediatric population is also suffering from an obesity epidemic. According to the CDC, by 2016, obesity in the United States has more than tripled in children and adolescents since the 1970s. In 2017-2018, more than one-third of children and adolescents had excess weight or obesity. According to a study by WHO, in 2016 over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 had excess weight or obesity.
The designations “overweight” and “having obesity” are based on the thresholds of BMI, which measures weight on a height-adjusted basis. A person with a BMI of 30 or greater is typically classified as having obesity, while a person with a BMI of between 25 and 30 is typically classified as overweight. BMI is considered the standard within the medical community for measuring body fat and is recommended by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, as a guide for the classification of people with excess weight and obesity.
There are a number of comorbidities caused by having either overweight or obesity. In the United States, obesity-related medical care costs were an estimated $147 billion in 2008 dollars. Approximately 300,000 people in the United States die each year as a result of obesity and its associated comorbidities, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. According to the WHO, 44% of diabetes diagnoses, 23% of ischemic heart disease diagnoses, and a significant percentage of certain cancer diagnoses can be attributed to being either having overweight or obesity.
The Covid-19 pandemic has placed even greater focus on the need to urgently address obesity. Unfortunately, Covid-19-related lockdowns appear to have exacerbated the problem, as an estimated 71 million Americans gained weight during the pandemic. Further, the World Obesity Federation (WOF) reported that 2.2 million of the 2.5 million (or 90%) of global Covid-19 deaths were in countries with high levels of obesity. In fact, people with obesity are 48% more likely to die of Covid-19.
Barriers to Weight Management
Despite over 70% of adults in the United States having a BMI greater than 25, with a higher risk for serious medical complications, only 2% of this population are prescribed drug therapy. In contrast, more than 80% of patients with type 2 diabetes are prescribed anti-diabetes pharmacotherapy. Considering that obesity is a major cause of type 2 diabetes, we believe these realities are paradoxical. Multiple studies have indicated that therapeutic inertia is high in the management of weight, particularly in patients with lower BMI. The highest rates of weight management interventions by primary care physicians occur for patients with BMI larger than 40 and the lowest for patients in the overweight category. A 2019 study of several large healthcare organizations reported that patients with a BMI greater than 35 accounted for 50.3% of all prescriptions for weight management pharmacotherapy, despite only making up

25.3% of the total patient sample. This study also found that the median BMI of a patient receiving weight management pharmacotherapy was 37.2. These results suggest that prescribers restrict the use of drug therapy to only patients in whom the benefit justifies the risk.
Other barriers to weight management include shorter health care provider visits allowing for limited time to educate patients on injection techniques (required of some pharmacotherapy options), titration of medication dose, signs and symptoms to monitor to prevent serious adverse events, how to manage milder drug-related symptoms such as nausea, etc.
In addition, we believe much of the inertia in addressing weight management can be attributed to the prevailing societal bias that obesity is a matter of personal responsibility and the false belief that “eat less and move more” will work for most people. A large number of people will not achieve meaningful and/or long-lasting weight loss simply by dieting and exercising on their own. Without help from drug, device or surgery, many people will fail. Finally, cost is a significant barrier for the majority of the population. Few weight management options are covered by third party payors and these drugs or interventions can be very costly and remain unaffordable.
Limitations of Current Treatments
Current treatments for patients with excess weight or obesity include lifestyle interventions (dietary changes, behavioral modification, increased physical activities, etc.), pharmacotherapies, endoscopic applications of intragastric balloons, and bariatric surgery that creates permanent changes in the GI tract anatomy. Lifestyle interventions focused on diet, and exercise and behavioral modification are typically prescribed as an initial treatment for a patient with overweight or obesity. However, lifestyle interventions frequently fail to produce adequate and durable weight loss due to poor compliance and other limiting factors. In conjunction with lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapies are approved for use by patients with a BMI of 27 or greater with at least one comorbidity, and all patients with a BMI of 30 or greater. Bariatric surgery, including gastric bypass and gastric banding procedures, is typically limited to patients with severe obesity, a BMI of greater than 40 or greater than 35 with at least one comorbidity. Although these procedures can produce dramatic weight loss results in this population, they come with a multitude of risks, including those inherent in surgery, such as an increased risk of death.
There are currently five pharmaceutical products approved in the United States for long-term weight management in people with excess weight and obesity, including products such as Orlistat, a combination product of phentermine and extended release topiramate, a combination product of naltrexone extended release and bupropion extended release; a higher dose subcutaneous injection of liraglutide, and a weekly subcutaneous injection of semaglutide. Each of these products act through mechanisms that require the product to be absorbed into the patient’s blood stream. As a result, these products carry the risk of systemic side effects, such as adverse gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and central nervous system effects, some of which can be serious or even life-threatening. Each of these approvals has also been accompanied by requirements for post-marketing safety studies to assess the safety of long-term treatment, with an emphasis on potential adverse cardiovascular side effects. In addition, Qsymia has been designated a Schedule IV controlled substance due to their potential for abuse. Furthermore, in connection with its approval of Qsymia, the FDA required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program to inform prescribers and women with the potential to become pregnant about the increased risk of congenital malformation in infants exposed to Qsymia in early pregnancy, as well as limiting access to certified pharmacies. The label for Contrave includes a black box warning from the FDA to alert health care professionals and patients to the increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, as well as serious neuropsychiatric events, associated with bupropion. These drugs also compete against generic forms of phentermine, topiramate, naltrexone, and bupropion. None of these products have been approved for use in pediatric patients and phentermine is only approved for short term use of no longer than 12 weeks.
All current prescribed pharmacotherapies are indicated only for individuals with BMI ≥ 30 or individuals with BMI ≥ 27 with existing health conditions brought on by extra weight such as diabetes, blood pressure or heart disease. More invasive treatment options include intragastric balloons, which reduce gastric volume via a foreign object such as a balloon that, in most cases, is placed by an endoscopic procedure similar to a gastroscopy in the stomach. The balloon is left in place for 6-12 months and then removed via endoscopy.
Long-term data is limited and weight loss is not anticipated to be maintained once the balloon is removed. Endoscopic procedures needed for placement and removal, in addition to the potential associated complications, limit their adoption. As of April 2020, the FDA has received reports of a total of 18 deaths that occurred in patients with liquid-filled intragastric balloon systems worldwide. Eight of these 18 deaths were patients in the United States.
We believe there is an urgent demand for affordable therapies that result in clinically meaningful weight loss with little or no additional safety risk, opening the possibility to treat people earlier at a lower BMI and potentially prevent or delay the progression of complications related to weight gain.
Our Approach to Weight Management


Plenity — A Biomimetic Approach. There are many lifestyle related drivers that contributed to the dramatic increase in obesity in the developed world over the last 50 years. One major contributor is the significant increase in the portion size of meals and another major contributor is the quality and composition of food, which has shifted to calorie dense and heavily processed. In addition there is a significant reduction in the consumption of hypocaloric foods, especially foods rich with fiber like vegetables and fruits. One of the reasons vegetables and fruits are so important to a healthy diet — in addition to their nutritional value — is that they provide bulk and texture to a meal and maintain their shape, structure, and firmness, through nearly the entire digestive process. They are also known to have important effect on the gut health. That’s why you tend to feel fuller when you eat a big salad with a meal, and thereby desire to eat less. We wanted to use science to create the same effect.



Plenity was designed using the principles of biomimicry. Biomimicry is the design of materials modeled on biologic structures — thereby leveraging natural designs that have evolved to work favorably in the body. Many modern inventions were developed by studying and mimicking the natural designs of plants and animals. Taking a biomimetic approach and therefore leveraging on “nature’s R&D,” Plenity is a first-of-its-kind superabsorbent hydrogel technology, specifically engineered to have the composition (i.e. large amount of water held by cellulose) and mechanical properties (i.e., elasticity or firmness) as ingested raw vegetables.
Our hydrogels are designed to address several critical challenges of the modern diet: portion size, caloric density, and food composition. Our solution to this challenge: the first super absorbent hydrogel technology based on naturally-derived building blocks, creating small firm 3D structures, similar to ingested raw vegetables, designed to create a sensation of feeling fuller. In the stomach the hydrogel particles form small solid non-aggregating gel pieces consisting of water held by 3D cellulose structures, similar to raw vegetables. There, they are homogeneously mixed with ingested foods, increasing volume and firmness while reducing the caloric density of meals. Like vegetables, the hydrogel pieces are not absorbed and ultimately partially degrade in the large intestine, releasing their water before leaving the body naturally. In clinical trials, 6 out of 10 people achieved clinically meaningful weight loss without serious side effects — losing an average of 10% of their total body weight or approximately 22 pounds.
The technology is non-invasive (taken by capsule, not an injectable), easy to use (the dosing is simple), and straightforward (with minimal clinical follow up). Plenity is non-systemic, not absorbed, and non-habit forming, giving consumers an option that is scientifically proven and clinically validated, FDA cleared, and rooted in nature.


The packaging for Plenity is designed for convenience and to be discrete: each pod contains one dose and is small enough to fit in your pocket. By having Plenity in pods it makes it easier to carry the dose needed for the day. Additionally, a week supply comes in a separate container of 14 pods so it makes it easy to travel with or keep at work for lunch and the rest at home.
Plenity is not a drug, so it does not negatively impact the brain as stimulants do, or affect other internal organs. It is non-systemic, and does not use hormones or require injections. It is also not habit forming and there is no limit on how long you can take Plenity.
We believe Plenity provides the following safety advantages over currently available therapies:
•acts mechanically in the GI tract and is not absorbed into the blood stream, avoiding acute and chronic side effects caused by systemically acting therapies; 
 •passes with food through the GI tract with no procedure required for introduction or removal; 


•has a natural cycling effect similar to food, preventing the habituation, adaptation, and irritation of the GI tract associated with some therapies, such as gastric balloons; and 
 •is engineered using components that are considered GRAS by the FDA and widely used in the food industry. 
 Mechanisms of Action
Plenity is designed to act mechanically throughout the GI tract, working with the body’s natural digestive process to occupy space in the stomach and small intestine without being absorbed as follows:
(1)Twenty minutes before lunch and dinner, three Plenity capsules are taken with two glasses (16 ounces) of water. 
 (2)The capsules are rapidly dissolved in the water, releasing thousands of individual hydrogel particles. 
 (3)These particles absorb up to 100X their size in water, forming small pieces of solid gel. They mix homogenously with the foods, increasing the volume and firmness of the ingested meals while reducing the caloric density, therefore promoting satiety and fullness. 
 (4)The hydrogel pieces are not digested and maintain their solid gel form as they pass throughout the small intestine as well. This prolongs the sensation of satiety and fullness. 
 (5)Upon transition into the large intestine, the digestive enzymes degrade the three-dimensional structure of the hydrogel particles resulting in the release of most of the water, which is then reabsorbed in the body. The remaining degraded particles pass through and are eliminated naturally from the body. 
 During this process, there are several relevant characteristics of Plenity that we believe ensure that the hydrogel travels safely through the body.



(1)“Caloric density” refers to the number of calories in a given mass of food. 
 How Plenity differs from fibers
Plenity forms a solid gel in the stomach and small intestine, which is orders of magnitude firmer than hydrated functional fibers like psyllium or glucomannan. This is because Plenity particles have a three-dimensional structure holding water inside them, while functional fibers have a liner structure and only attract water to their surface. Therefore, Plenity creates a firm solid gel pieces very

similar to ingested raw vegetables, while functional fibers create viscous liquids, more like a soup. This firmness can be measured and demonstrated through digestive simulations, by measuring the firmness/elasticity, measured as G prime, or G’, utilizing a rheometer.

Plenity clinical study overview
We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial (the most rigorous type of trial design) of 436 adults with excess weight or obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes, BMI 27-40, over the course of 24 weeks (six months). Plenity or placebo were given in conjunction with diet and exercise.
The GLOW study was designed to measure:
•Whether at least 35% of individuals receiving Plenity lost 5% or more of their body weight 
 •Whether individuals receiving Plenity lost more of their body weight than individuals receiving placebo with a super-superiority margin of 3% 
 Key highlights of the GLOW study include the following:
•Six out of ten of individuals receiving Plenity lost at least 5% of their body weight with an average loss of 10% of total body weight (about 22 pounds). These responders also lost an average of 3.5 inches off of their waist measurement. 
 •The percent weight loss in all individuals receiving Plenity was 6.4% compared to a 4.4% loss for individuals receiving placebo (p=0.0007) 
 •27% were “super-responders” to Plenity. Their average weight loss was 14% (about 30 pounds) 
 •Plenity doubled the odds of achieving 5% or greater weight loss compared to placebo 
 •Plenity had an overall side effect profile similar to placebo, and no serious adverse events. The most common side effects were diarrhea, distended abdomen, infrequent bowel movements, and flatulence Data from this study was presented in the journal Obesity authored by leading obesity experts including Frank L. Greenway, MD of LSU’s Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Louis J. Aronne, MD of Weill Cornell Medicine, Caroline Apovian, MD of the Boston University School of Medicine, and Lee M. Kaplan, MD PhD of Massachusetts General Hospital. The paper was named Editor’s Choice. 


We have also conducted a small clinical trial in patients that are overweight or obese that was an extension of our larger GLOW study. This extension clinical trial looked at patients who stayed on Plenity for an additional six months (for a total of 12 months). This study demonstrated that, on average, subjects maintained the weight loss they achieved during the first six months of treatment or lost an additional small amount of weight in months six through twelve.
We believe that currently having limited long-term data does not impact the commercialization of Plenity for patients with a BMI of 25 to 40. This is because as part of the April 2019 FDA clearance of Plenity, we received a clear indication that Plenity can be prescribed for patients for an unlimited amount of time — therefore, we believe no additional data or studies are required to support the long-term use of Plenity.
In terms of additional indications that we may pursue, we have completed, and plan to complete, additional studies to support gaining FDA clearance for these indications. A six-month study examining the impact of one of our hydrogels on patients with pre-diabetes or diabetes with respect to weight loss was recently completed and, as of the date of this prospectus, the results remain under analysis as described below. The two primary endpoints of this study are: 1) the proportion of subjects who achieve weight loss ≥5.0%, and 2) the average percent change in total body weight. In both cases the outcome for subjects on our hydrogel (i.e., GS200) are compared to the outcomes for subjects on placebo at the end of the six-month study. These two weight loss metrics are standard for weight studies designed for FDA review. We are still evaluating whether the outcome results of this study will support FDA authorization for these specific populations or if further studies are advisable.
Our Other Product Candidates
Our proprietary hydrogel technology allows the flexibility to specifically engineer the hydrogel structure to have different physical properties (e.g., elasticity, media uptake ratio or volume, and hydration speed) that could potentially benefit multiple GI-related and chronic metabolic diseases including pre-diabetes (which occurs in approximately 30% of the adult population), type 2 diabetes (which occurs in approximately 10% of the population), NAFLD/NASH (occurring in 25% of the adult population), and FC (occurring in 14% of the adult population). Each of our pipeline candidates are likely to be regulated by the FDA through the de novo classification or 510(k) pathways.
The following table summarizes the current and expected development status of our product candidates.

GS200 for Weight loss in Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes
Because people classified as having obesity are much more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, the increase in obesity rates has contributed significantly to the increase in the number of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (defined by a fasting blood glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL). According to the American Diabetes Association, or ADA, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death by disease in the United States in 2017. In 2018, approximately 30.7-32.5 million Americans suffered from type 2 diabetes and 89% of U.S. adults diagnosed with diabetes were overweight or had obesity. An additional 88 million American adults 20 years of age and older were considered as having prediabetes (defined by a fasting blood glucose level ≥ 100 mg/dL and < 126 mg/dL), with approximately 1.5 million new diagnoses of type 2 diabetes per year. Based on current trends, as many as one in three Americans will develop type 2 diabetes in their lifetime. According to the ADA, the economic impact of diagnosed diabetes was estimated to be $327 billion in 2017, approximately $237 billion of which was attributed to direct medical costs, and approximately $90 billion of which was attributed to reduced productivity.

The current treatment paradigm for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes focuses on lifestyle changes, in particular weight loss, as a foundational therapy — as weight loss alone is associated with improvements in glycemic parameters and prevention of the progression from prediabetes to diabetes. Medications to manage blood glucose levels are also prescribed for patients with diabetes. Surprisingly, weight loss therapies are generally not commonly prescribed to these patient populations. Only 2% of people who have excess weight or obesity receive weight loss therapies, and many of these patients have prediabetes or diabetes.
GS200 is a hydrogel similar in concept to Plenity, but has different physical properties that we believe could address different indications and treatment regimens. When compared to Plenity, GS200 hydrates more rapidly and creates a higher elastic response while it occupies a slightly smaller volume in the stomach. For example, due to its higher elastic response and accelerated hydration, GS200 could be more suitable for glycemic control, where one relevant mechanism is the delay of the absorption of glucose in the small intestine. For this purpose, the volumetric effect at the beginning of the meal could be less important and GS200 could be administered immediately prior to the meal. We believe that these properties could make GS200 more suitable as a weight loss and glycemic control product for prediabetics and type 2 diabetics. GS200 is currently being evaluated in a human study where the primary endpoints are weight loss and some of the secondary endpoints are related to glycemic control. We are presently reviewing the data reported in this study.
GS200 clinical study overview and reported data
We completed a preliminary analysis of the LIGHT-UP study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigational study that enrolled 254 subjects with overweight or obesity who also have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, and that analysis remains underway. The study was designed to assess the change in body weight in adults after six months of treatment with a new oral superabsorbent hydrogel (GS200) or placebo. The study met both of its primary endpoints: the proportion of participants who achieved at least 5% body weight loss (defined as “Responders”) and the change in body weight as compared to placebo after six months of therapy.
Among the participants who completed the study protocol requirements, or the per protocol (“PP”) population, 64% of GS200-treated participants were Responders vs. 41% in the placebo group (p=0.001). Including data from participants who did not complete the study, or the intent-to-treat multiple imputation (“ITT-MI”) population, in the preliminary analysis, 55% of GS200- treated participants were Responders vs. 34% in the placebo group (p=0.0004). The average body weight loss of the Responders was 11% (approximately 23 pounds) and their waist circumference was reduced by 5.5 inches on average. Importantly, GS200 treated participants had 2.8 higher odds as compared to placebo to become Responders (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.83, P=0.0004), achieving the first primary endpoint of the study.
With respect to average total weight loss, the complete GS200 treatment group (including both Responders and non-Responders) demonstrated superiority over placebo after 6 months of treatment (body weight loss of 6.9% vs. 4.1%, P=0.0003 in the PP population and 6.3% vs. 3.6%, P=0.0006 in the ITT-MI population), thereby achieving the second primary endpoint.
This study was conducted at 36 clinical sites in Europe and North America with 208 subjects who completed the 6-month study. Upon preliminary regional analyses, both primary endpoints were met across the entire ITT-MI and PP populations and were also highly significant in Europe alone (N=134 completers). In North America alone, there was no difference between GS200 and placebo with respect to the primary endpoints. The North American region included approximately half the number of subjects who completed the study compared to Europe (N=74 completers). While the primary endpoints were met, Gelesis continues to analyze this data and the insights it may derive as it plans its next steps in the development of GS200 and final plans to present the detailed results in a scientific venue.
Less than 2% of the GS200 treated participants dropped out of the LIGHT-UP study due to adverse events (AEs), which was similar to the dropout rate in the placebo group. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence and severity of AEs between the two groups except for the overall incidence of gastrointestinal-related AEs, which was slightly higher in the GS200 group. No serious adverse events related to GS200 were observed and 95% of all AEs in the GS200 group were mild or moderate in intensity.
GS200 as a weight management food supplement
 We are exploring opportunities of utilizing GS200 as a food supplement or added to different types of foods, such as food bars or other nutritional products. The building blocks of the Gelesis hydrogel platform are consumed as foods and considered by the FDA as generally regarded as safe or “GRAS”. This pedigree provides an opportunity to develop GS200 as a supplement and potentially apply to products that do not go through the FDA regulatory drug or device process. Gelesis already has developed multiple prototype food bars and has the ability to quickly adapt the delivery vehicle to make it easy to consume.

GS500 for Functional Constipation (formerly known as chronic idiopathic constipation)
FC is a health condition in which a person experiences chronic symptoms of constipation without an identifiable cause. It is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders worldwide, with a global prevalence of 14% in adults. In the United States, approximately 35 million adults may suffer from FC. Lifestyle modifications, including increasing dietary fiber, hydration and exercise, are the first step in managing FC. If patients do not respond to these lifestyle modifications, then treatment with osmotic and stimulant laxatives (mostly over-the-counter products) are often used. Approximately 50% of patients do not find these traditional laxatives to be satisfactory and seek other solutions. Prescription options sometimes are offered to patients that do not respond to traditional laxatives, but these options have common side effects (e.g., diarrhea).
Existing prescription options include Amitiza (lubiprostone), Linzess (linaclotide), Trulance (plecanatide) and Motegrity (prucalopride). All of these drug therapies work by entering the patient’s blood stream.
Similar to Plenity, our superabsorbent hydrogel candidate GS500 has a unique non-systemic mechanism of action and works locally in the GI tract. If proven safe and effective, GS500 has the potential to become a new approach to treat FC. In an investigator sponsored study conducted by researchers at the Massachusetts General Hospital, GS500 demonstrated statistically significant benefit in decreasing colon transit time. We plan to advance GS500 into a pivotal 12-week global study that is expected to enroll 260 subjects with FC and compare the effectiveness of GS500 to a placebo. We anticipate top line results in the fourth quarter of 2024.
 Sales and Marketing
Plenity is, and our future product candidates, if approved, may, be marketed, detailed, and presented through the same channels as orally administered weight loss pharmaceuticals. Plenity is, and our future product candidates, if approved, may be prescribed predominantly by primary care physicians, including general practitioners, family practitioners, and internists, as well as endocrinologists and obesity/metabolism specialists.
We have partnered with Roman Health Pharmacy (“Ro”), a leading telehealth platform in the United States, to provide convenient and immediate access to physicians online at no cost. We have entered into an agreement with Ro, giving it exclusive telehealth distributor rights to sell Plenity via telehealth in the United States through June 2023. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we have no obligations or commitments beyond the sale and supply of Plenity to Ro. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Ro has no obligations or commitments specifically with respect to marketing and promotional spend in support of the sale of Plenity to consumers.
We have established partnerships with behavioral weight management companies such as WW International, Inc. and Noom, providing members access to WW’s behavioral weight management program and supporting lifestyle content and offering discounts to Noom’s subscription programs. To further develop our commercial infrastructure, we may establish additional alliances with additional biotechnology or pharmaceutical company collaborators, depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the related development costs, and our available resources.
Our ability to expand our customer base through sales and marketing efforts and generate related revenue is dependent upon our ability to successfully raise additional capital to fund such efforts. Our failure to obtain additional funding may force us to delay, limit or terminate some or all of our sales and marketing efforts, which may negatively impact our ability to acquire sufficient customers to operate profitably.
Plans to Make Plenity Available Without a Prescription
 
We believe Plenity’s advantages are its differentiated safety-to-efficacy profile, broad approved labeling, and affordability to the consumer. Accordingly, we believe it is important that Plenity be widely available and easily accessible to consumers. In addition to making Plenity more accessible to people struggling with excess weight, we believe making Plenity available OTC could reduce costs associated with acquiring new members and allow us to reduce costs associated with the prescription granting process, while also enabling new sales channels for us. In January 2023, we submitted a 510(k), or premarket notification, to the FDA to change Plenity's classification in the United States from prescription-only to OTC and anticipate the FDA's decision on our 510(k) submission by the third quarter of 2023.
Competition
Due to the growing overweight and obesity epidemic and consumer demand, there are many competitors in the field of obesity treatment. Obesity treatments range from behavioral modification, to drugs and medical devices, and surgery, generally as a last resort. Although Plenity regulated as a novel medical device, it can be used by patients and prescribed by physicians in the same manner as an orally administered drug. Because of Plenity’s unique product profile and go-to-market strategy, also considering the significant clinical inertia not to treat overweight and obesity, we expect Plenity to become a foundational approach for weight management and be positioned to work synergistically with other approaches rather than being a direct competition.
Orally Administered Drugs
Three oral drugs that are FDA approved and currently marketed for the treatment of obesity are phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, and orlistat. Each treatment is indicated for patients with overweight and obesity with at least one comorbidity. In September 2012, Vivus, Inc. commercially launched its combination product, Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate) in the United States. In October 2014, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited commercially launched its combination product, Contrave (naltrexone/ bupropion), in the United States. Contrave is currently marketed in the United States by Currax Pharmaceuticals LLC. Orlistat is currently marketed in the United States by H2-Pharma, LLC under the brand name Xenical and over-the-counter at half the dose of Orlistat by GlaxoSmithKline plc under the brand name alli. In addition to competing with one another, these drugs also compete against generic forms of phentermine, topiramate, naltrexone, and bupropion.
Injectable Drugs
Several pharmaceutical companies, have or are developing injectable drugs for obesity. Saxenda, a formulation of Novo Nordisk’s liraglutide, was approved by the FDA in December 2014 for the treatment of obesity. Liraglutide is currently also marketed by Novo Nordisk for the treatment of type 2 diabetes under the brand name Victoza in the United States. Wegovy, a sub-cutaneous formulation of Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide was approved by the FDA in June of 2021. Tirzeptide, marketed by Lilly under the brand name Mouniaro, was approved by the FDA in May 2022 for adults living with type 2 diabetes and is currently in phase III development for obesity.
 Medical Devices and Surgery
Other than Plenity, four types of FDA-regulated devices are currently marketed for weight loss. Intragastric balloon manufacturers including Apollo EndoSurgery, Inc. and Obalon Therapeutics, Inc. commercialize ORBERA Balloon and the Obalon Balloon, respectively. Aspire Assist, manufactured by Aspire Bariatrics, Inc., is a gastric emptying system that allows patient to aspirate digested food after a meal. SmartByte, manufactured by Scientific Intake Limited Co., is a device that is designed to occupy space in the roof of the mouth to reduce food intake. LAP-BAND Adjustable Gastric Banding System, manufactured by BioEnterics Corporation, is a gastric band that is placed around the upper part of the stomach in a surgical procedure leaving only a small pouch available for food.
Bariatric surgery, including gastric bypass, gastric sleeve and gastric banding procedures, is typically employed for patients with obesity with a BMI exceeding 40 or those with a BMI greater than 35 who are experiencing obesity-related complications such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or severe sleep apnea.
Reimbursement
We believe the successful launch of our products and product candidates will not be dependent on reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government health programs and private insurance companies and we do not expect any such direct reimbursement to be available at this time. Accordingly, our strategy and business plan do not contemplate any such reimbursement. Although obesity has long been recognized as a significant public health and economic problem for the U.S. healthcare system, insurance coverage for obesity treatments has been limited. The legislative authorization for Medicare’s prescription drug benefit program specifically prohibits coverage of obesity drugs and until recently, there has been little clinical evidence to convince insurers of the efficacy of obesity treatments, let alone coverage for dietary regimens and products. When coverage is provided by insurers, such as for treatments such as bariatric surgery, it is typically limited to patients with morbid obesity. For reasons noted elsewhere herein, we believe that our commercialization strategy, which does not rely on third-party-payor reimbursement, has a number of significant strategic advantages for us.
Government Regulation
General Requirements for Regulation of Medical Devices in the United States
Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, a medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component part, or accessory which is: (i) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them; (ii) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or (iii) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes.
In the United States, medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the FDC Act, and its implementing regulations, and certain other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, the research and development, design, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion, post-approval monitoring and reporting, distribution and import and export of medical devices. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending premarket approval applications, or PMAs, issuance of warning letters, mandatory product recalls, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three classifications based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. Class III devices must typically be approved by the FDA before they are marketed.
Generally, establishments that manufacture and/or distribute devices, including manufacturers, contract manufacturers, sterilizers, repackagers and relabelers, specification developers, reprocessors of single-use devices, remanufacturers, initial importers, manufacturers of accessories and components sold directly to the end user, and U.S. manufacturers of export-only devices, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and provide the FDA a list of the devices that they handle at their facilities.
Pre-market Approval and Pre-market Notification
While most Class I and some Class II devices can be marketed without prior FDA authorization, most medical devices can be legally sold within the United States only if the FDA has: (i) approved a PMA application prior to marketing, applicable to Class III devices for which the FDA has required a PMA; or (ii) cleared the device in response to a premarket notification, or 510(k) submission, generally applicable to Class II and some Class I devices. Some devices that have been classified as Class III are regulated pursuant to the 510(k) requirements because FDA has not yet called for PMAs for these devices. Other less common regulatory pathways to market for Class III devices include the humanitarian device exception, or HDE, or a product development protocol, or PDP.
510(k) Pre-market Notification Most Class II and limited Class I devices require a 510(k) clearance in order to be commercially distributed in the United States. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, referred to as the predicate device. A predicate device may be a previously 510(k) cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet required submission of PMA applications. The manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or it is shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device.
There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional, special and abbreviated. Special 510(k)s are for devices that are modified and the modification needs a new 510(k) and the methods used to evaluate the changes are well established, and the results can be sufficiently reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format. Abbreviated 510(k)s are for devices that conform to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review. The FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt, and abbreviated 510(k) within 90 days of receipt.
Though statutorily required to clear a traditional 510(k) within 90 days of receipt, the clearance pathway for traditional 510(k)s can take from four to 12 months, or even longer.
De Novo Classification Devices of a new type that FDA has not previously classified based on risk are automatically classified into Class III by operation of section 513(f)(1) of the FDC Act, regardless of the level of risk they pose. To avoid requiring PMA review of

low-to moderate-risk devices classified in Class III by operation of law, Congress enacted section 513(f)(2) of the FDC Act. This provision allows FDA to classify a low-to moderate-risk device not previously classified into Class I or II. The de novo process has been infrequently used. In 2012, Congress amended the process to potentially make it more amenable to FDA and industry. It is not yet clear whether the changes will lead to greater use of de novo classification.
PMA Approval For Class III devices for which the FDA has required a PMA, a PMA application must be submitted to the FDA with proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. The cost of preparing and submitting a PMA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most PMAs is additionally subject to a substantial annually-adjusted application user fee, currently exceeding $250,000. Satisfaction of FDA premarket approval requirements typically takes years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the device or disease.
Results from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials are required to establish the safety and effectiveness of a Class III PMA device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. After completion of the required clinical testing, a PMA including the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing, and information relating to the product’s marketing history, manufacture, and controls, is prepared and submitted to the FDA.
Upon submission, the FDA determines if the PMA application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, and, if so, the application is accepted for filing. The FDA then commences an in-depth review of the PMA application, which typically takes one to three years, but could take longer. The review time is often significantly extended as a result of the FDA asking for additional information or clarification of information already provided. During the review period, an FDA advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, may be convened to review the application and recommend to the FDA whether, or upon what conditions, the device should be approved. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendation is important to the FDA’s overall decision making process. The FDA will also typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA regulations. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the device is manufactured. FDA will not approve the device unless compliance is shown with Quality System Requirements (“QSR”), which impose elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
Upon completion of PMA review, the FDA can: (i) approve the PMA; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates the FDA’s belief that the PMA is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires, or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii) issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA’s review clock is reset.
An approval order authorizes commercial marketing of the device with specific prescribing information for one or more specific indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the manufacturer. As a condition of PMA approval, the FDA may restrict the sale, distribution, or use of the device to help ensure that the benefits of the device outweigh the potential risks. Moreover, FDA may impose substantial post-approval testing and post-market surveillance to monitor the device’s safety or effectiveness. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. Once granted, FDA has the authority to withdraw device approvals if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
An “approvable letter” generally requires the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, e.g., changes in labeling, or specific additional information, e.g., submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA application. Once the approvable letter is satisfied, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications.
Exempt Devices If a manufacturer’s device falls into a generic category of Class I or Class II devices that FDA has exempted by regulation, a premarket notification is not required before marketing the device in the United States. Manufacturers of such devices are required to register their establishments and list the generic category or classification name of their devices. Some 510(k)-exempt devices are also exempt from QSR, except for the QSR-complaint handling and recordkeeping requirements.
Pre-Submission Meetings The FDA has mechanisms to provide companies with guidance prior to formal submission of either a 510(k) or PMA. One such mechanism is the pre-submission program in which a company has a “pre-submission” meeting as outlined in the FDA guidance document “Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with the Food and Drug Administration Staff” that was issued on February 18, 2014. The main purpose of the pre-submission meeting is to provide companies with guidance from the FDA on matters of significance to an approval decision. Prior to the pre-submission meeting, the company provides a briefing document to the FDA. The FDA is not obligated to follow the recommendations it provides to companies as a result of a pre-submission meeting.

Clinical Trials
A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application or de novo submission and is sometimes required for a premarket notification. For significant risk devices, the FDA regulations require that human clinical investigations conducted in the United States be approved via an Investigational Drug Exemption or IDE, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE; however, the clinical trial must still be conducted in compliance with various requirements of FDA’s IDE regulations. In some cases, one or more smaller studies may precede a pivotal clinical trial intended to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational device. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IDE is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE that require modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. If the FDA disapproves the IDE within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IDE may not begin.
An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must also include a description of product manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of patients to be treated at specified study centers. During the study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with all reporting and record keeping requirements. The IDE requirements apply to all investigational devices, whether considered a significant or nonsignificant risk.
Prior to granting PMA approval, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the study and the clinical data supporting the PMA application for compliance with IDE requirements.
Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, including those related to good clinical practices, or GCPs, which are intended to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors; and (ii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Clinical trials are typically conducted at geographically diverse clinical trial sites, and are designed to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the device and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the device. Clinical trials, for significant and nonsignificant risk devices, must be approved by an institutional review board, or IRB, for each trial site. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving patients and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of human research subjects.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing.
Investigational devices may only be distributed for use in an investigation, and must bear a label with the statement: “CAUTION — Investigational device. Limited by Federal law to investigational use.”
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of medical devices are required to register with clinicaltrials.gov, a public database of clinical trial information, and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of these trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the product being studied has been approved. For medical device clinical trials, public availability of study registration information can also be delayed until approval of the device. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.
Post-market Requirements
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the QSR, labeling regulations, the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses, the Medical Device Reporting regulation, and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act).
FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as:
•fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; 
 •recall or seizure of products; 
 •operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
 •refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; 
 •withdrawing PMA approvals already granted; and 
 •criminal prosecution. 
 Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Device Modifications
Some changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMAs.
Modifications to a device that received 510(k) clearance may require a new 510(k) submission if those changes could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, or if the modifications represent a major change in intended use. If the manufacturer determines that a modification could not substantially affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, it should document the changes and rationale for not submitting a new 510(k). Though the manufacturer is responsible for the initial assessment, FDA may disagree, and later require the manufacturer to submit a 510(k) for the modified device. FDA could require the manufacturer to cease marketing the modified device during the pendency of the 510(k) clearance process.
Adverse Event Reporting and QSR Compliance
Following FDA approval of a PMA or 510(k) clearance, the device sponsor must submit reports to FDA regarding adverse events. Under the Medical Device Reporting regulation, manufacturers must report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. For a PMA or Class II 510(k) device, the FDA also may require device tracking, and post-market surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved or cleared product. The FDA may also require post-market studies. In addition, quality-control, manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to the QSR after approval and clearance. FDA is required by the FDC Act to inspect device manufacturers every 2 years to assess compliance with the QSR, although FDA does not always adhere to this schedule. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with the QSR. The FDA may withdraw product approvals or recommend product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory requirements. FDA has the authority to conduct mandatory recalls, but that authority is rarely used.

Regulation of the Practice of Medicine and Telehealth in the United States
An important element of our direct-to-consumer approach is providing consumer access through telehealth platforms. The practice of medicine, including telehealth medicine, is subject to various federal, state and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, approvals and standards, relating to, among other things, the qualifications of the provider, the practice of medicine (including specific requirements when providing health care utilizing telehealth technologies and the provision of remote care), the continuity and adequacy of medical care, the maintenance of medical records, the supervision of personnel, and the prerequisites for the prescription of medical devices such as Plenity. Because the practice of telehealth is relatively new and rapidly developing, regulation of telehealth is evolving and the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws, regulations and standards can be uncertain or uneven. However, as of now, interpretation of the state medical boards policy in all fifty states permit the prescribing of Plenity through telehealth platforms, and Plenity is being made available through telehealth platforms in all fifty states.
Advertising, Promotion, Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Laws, and Other Healthcare Regulatory Laws
A device may be marketed only for the indications for use for which it was approved or cleared.
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of devices, device companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business that may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and transparency laws and regulations related to pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and responsible individuals may be subject to imprisonment.
Regulatory Considerations for Outside the United States
In the European Union medical devices were previously regulated under Directive 93/42/EEC, also known as the Medical Device Directive, or MDD, and the implementing legislation in each Member State of the European Union, or EU. On May 26, 2021, Regulation 2017/745, also known as the Medical Devices Regulation, or MDR, became fully available. The MDR repealed the MDD and was, among other things, intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.
In order to be sold in the Member States of the EU, medical devices must comply with the general safety and performance requirements of the MDR (previously, the essential requirements of the MDD) and therefore be entitled to bear the Conformité Européene, or CE, marking, without which they cannot be sold. The most fundamental essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the risk class of the device. Devices can fall under Class I (lowest risk), Class IIa, Class IIb and Class III (the highest risk). Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements of the MDR, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an independent organization accredited by a Member State of the European Union to conduct conformity assessments, known as a notified body. Depending on the device’s class, the manufacturer may submit a technical file to a notified body that demonstrates consistency with the general safety and performance requirements under the MDR. Class III devices also require submission of a design dossier. Demonstrating consistency with the MDR’s requirements may entail the manufacturer providing both pre-clinical as well as human data form clinical trials. The notified body’s assessment also may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system or specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. A number of notified bodies exist in the EU and the sponsoring company is responsible for choosing the notified body. The notified body issues a certificate of conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the general safety and performance requirements. This certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.
Under the MDR, conformity assessment certificates issued under the MDD prior to May 25, 2017 until May 25, 2021 will remain valid in accordance with their term, but shall not exceed five years and shall become void after May 26, 2024. However, in response to concerns raised about notified body capacity and the ability for devices to be re-certified within such time period, the European Commission has adopted a proposal to extend the transition period by some years, depending on the risk class of the device. Such proposal is currently being considered for adoption by the European Parliament and Council.


In order for devices to be sold in the EU, a quality management system, or QMS, must be put in place that is consistent with certain sets of standards set by the International Standards Organization, or ISO, such as ISO 13485. The QMS must be audited prior to Gelesis100 obtaining a CE mark. In the EU, manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by competent authorities.
Following the UK’s departure from the EU on January 31, 2020, the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) continued to follow the same regulations as the EU during a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020. Now that this transition period has ended, all medical devices must be registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, before being placed on the Great Britain (GB) market and a new UKCA Mark was introduced for medical devices placed on the GB market. European CE marks will continue to be recognized in GB until June 30, 2024, following which transitional arrangements will apply before all devices will be required to have a UKCA mark to be marketed in GB. The MDR does not apply in GB and, now that GB and EU regulatory systems are independent, the regulation of medical devices in GB may diverge more significantly from EU regulations in the future. The EU regulatory framework on medical devices does, however, continue to apply in Northern Ireland under the Northern Irish Protocol and medical devices in Northern Ireland may either carry a European CE mark or a CE UKNI mark (although devices bearing the CE UKNI marking will not be accepted on the EU market).
Although some other countries outside of the United States and the EU may accept either FDA approval or a CE mark as a basis for regulatory approval, many countries, e.g., Japan, have their own requirements in order for a device to be marketed. In order to market its products in those countries, Gelesis would need to submit the appropriate applications and meet the requirements set by those regulatory agencies.
As is the case in the United States, the failure to comply with regulatory requirements in foreign countries subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. New information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could result in either increased regulatory requirements or change the ability of Gelesis to access markets.
License Agreements
One S.r.l.
In October 2008, we entered into a patent license and assignment agreement and master agreement with One S.r.l., or One, and certain inventors to license and subsequently purchase certain intellectual property, including core patents that cover our superabsorbent hydrogel technology. One and the inventors are bound by non-competition provisions, which prohibit them from developing, manufacturing or commercializing any product or process related to diet, weight loss, food products or obesity during the term of our agreement and for a year after its termination. Additionally, the inventors have agreed to assign to us certain future technology relating to food products that they develop during the term of the agreement, as well as other improvements to our existing intellectual property rights that result from certain activities they perform for us.
In October 2020, we last amended and restated the agreement with One, pursuant to which we are required to pay One a 2.0% royalty on net product sales and €17.5 million upon the achievement of certain milestones and pay royalties on future sales and/or a percentage of sublicense income.
In August 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Warrant Purchase Agreement dated October 21, 2020, by and between us and the holders of the warrants. Pursuant to the amendment, we deferred payment of the aggregate remaining purchase price under the patent license and assignment agreement and master agreement between us and One S.r.l., totaling €2.5 million, owed to One S.r.l. shareholders until March 31, 2023.
 Pursuant to the amendment, and in consideration for the deferral, we amended the exercise price of the One S.r.l. warrant holders’ 1,353,062 previously issued common stock warrants from $4.26 to $1.45.
China Medical System (CMS)
In June 2020, we and CMS Bridging DMCC, a subsidiary of China Medical Systems Holdings Limited, or CMS, entered into a set of licensing, collaboration, and investing agreements, or CMS Agreements, involving the license of our intellectual property to CMS in Greater China (including Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), Singapore and United Arab Emirates, or the CMS Territory, and governing the supply of Plenity to CMS for sale in the CMS Territory. Under the terms of the CMS Agreements, we granted CMS an exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, and royalty-bearing license of our intellectual property to develop, import,

register, manufacture, and commercialize Plenity, whether through online sales channels or offline sales channels during the term of the CMS Agreements. In accordance with the CMS Agreements, all legal and beneficial ownership of (i) all intellectual property rights relating to Plenity (including any data generated from the use of Plenity and other improvements) and (ii) all of the information provided or generated under the CMS Agreements or otherwise related to Plenity shall both ultimately belong to and remain vested with us. CMS must purchase Plenity at a markup of our cost of goods sold.
As consideration for the rights and licenses granted to CMS under the CMS Agreements, CMS paid us a one-time, non-refundable and non-creditable upfront fee of $15.0 million and is required to pay a one-time, non-refundable, and non-creditable milestone payment of $5.0 million within thirty (30) days after the earlier of (i) the approval of marketing authorization of Plenity as a prescription product by the National Medical Products Administration, and (ii) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the CMS Agreements’ effective date. The CMS Agreements also contain commercial milestones of up to $388 million in the aggregate, due to us based on the achievement of annual net product revenue thresholds in the CMS Territory. Additionally, CMS will pay us royalties on net sales of all our products sold in the CMS Territory commencing January 1, 2022 through the expiration date of the CMS Agreements.
In August 2022, we entered into an amendment to CMS Agreements, pursuant to which the one-time, non-refundable, and non-creditable regulatory approval milestone payment of $5.0 million provided for in the original agreement became immediately payable. In addition, the amendment expands the CMS Territory to include Brunei, Myanmar, Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam and provides that the minimum annual royalty term for CMS territory will commence January 2024 (rather than January 2022, as previously provided under the original agreement) and extend through the expiration date of the amended agreement.
Upon execution of the amendment, we also issued to CMS a warrant to purchase up to 400,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The warrant expires on the date that is ten years from the date of issuance and is exercisable at any time from the date of issuance until the expiration date.
 PureTech Health
In December 2009, we entered into a royalty and sublicense income agreement with PureTech Health LLC, or PureTech, under which we are required to pay PureTech a 2.0% royalty on net product sales received as a result of developing hydrogel-based products and technology using the intellectual property we license from PureTech. The royalty rate is subject to certain downward adjustments in the event we are required to pay third parties to obtain a license to intellectual property rights that are necessary for us to develop or commercialize our products. Our obligation to pay royalties to PureTech will terminate upon termination of our license agreement with One.
Trade Secrets
Our proprietary superabsorbent hydrogel technology is also protected as trade secrets, which cover a variety of aspects of our operations. Our trade secrets may include manufacturing operations and other business processes. We use a variety of means to protect our trade secrets, including entering into confidentiality agreement with employees and third parties.
