Company History

iCoreConnect Inc., (the “Company”), a Nevada Corporation, is a cloud-based software and technology company focused on increasing workflow productivity and customer profitability through its enterprise platform of applications and services.
Recent Developments

On January 5, 2023, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, FG Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation (“FGMC”), and FG Merger Sub Inc., a Nevada corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of FGMC (“Merger Sub”). The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, at the closing (the “Closing”) of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of FGMC. In connection with the Merger, FGMC will change its name to “iCoreConnect Inc.” The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are hereinafter referred to as the “Business Combination.”

The Business Combination is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain governmental approvals and the required approval by the stockholders of FGMC and iCoreConnect.

Prior to the Closing, (i) each vested issued and outstanding option to purchase the Company’s common stock shall be exercised into shares of the Company’s common stock (ii) each issued and outstanding warrant to purchase the Company’s common stock shall be exercised into shares of the Company’s common stock and (iii) the outstanding principal together with all accrued and unpaid interest under each convertible promissory note shall be converted into shares of the Company’s common stock.

Prior to the Closing, each share of FGMC common stock par value $0.0001 (“FGMC Common Stock”) shall be converted into shares of newly issued FGMC preferred stock, par value $0.0001 (“FGMC Preferred Stock”). The FGMC Preferred Stock shall have the following rights, preferences, powers, privileges and restrictions, qualifications and limitations:


· | The holders of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any matters submitted to the stockholders of FGMC.

· | From and after the date of the issuance of any shares of FGMC Preferred Stock, dividends shall accrue at the rate per annum of 12% of the original issue price for each share of FGMC Preferred Stock, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any other dividend (subject to appropriate adjustments). 
· | From the closing of the Business Combination until the second anniversary of the date of the original issuance of the FGMC Preferred Stock, FGMC may, at its option, pay all or part of the accruing dividends on the FGMC Preferred Stock by issuing and delivering additional shares of FGMC Preferred Stock to the holders thereof.

· | In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of FGMC, the holders of shares of FGMC Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of FGMC available for distribution to its stockholders an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) one times the applicable original issue price, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, and (ii) such amount as would have been payable had all shares of FGMC Preferred Stock been converted into FGMC Common Stock pursuant to the following paragraph immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, before any payment shall be made to the holders of FGMC Common Stock. 
· | After 24 months from the closing of the Business Combination, in the event the closing share price of the FGMC Common Stock shall exceed 140% of the Conversion Price (as defined in the Merger Agreement) then in effect, then (i) each outstanding share of FGMC Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into such number of shares of FGMC Common Stock as is determined by dividing the original issue price by the Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by FGMC, subject to adjustment. At the time of such conversion, FGMC shall declare and pay all of the dividends that are accrued and unpaid as of the time of the conversion by either, at the option of FGMC, (i) issuing additional FGMC Preferred Stock or (ii) paying cash.
· | Each share of FGMC Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of FGMC Common Stock as is determined by dividing the original issue price by the Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion, subject to adjustment. 
· | Immediately prior to any such optional conversion FGMC shall pay all dividends on the FGMC Preferred Stock being converted that are accrued and unpaid as of such time by, either, at the option of FGMC: (i) issuing additional FGMC Preferred Stock or (ii) paying cash. 


The aggregate consideration to be received by the Company’s stockholders is based on a pre-transaction equity value of $98,000,000 (subject to usual and customary working capital adjustments and any adjustments to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, merger, sale or exchange of shares or other like change with respect to shares of FGMC Common Stock, occurring prior to the Closing date).

Software as a Service (SaaS) Offerings

The Company currently markets secure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) offering under the names of iCoreRx, iCorePDMP, iCoreEPCS, iCoreVerify, iCoreVerify+, iCoreHuddle, iCoreHuddle+, iCoreCodeGenius, iCoreExchange, iCoreCloud, iCorePay, iCoreSecure, and iCoreIT. The Company’s software is sold under annual recurring revenue subscriptions.

iCoreRx – iCoreRx is a HIPAA compliant electronic prescription SaaS solution that integrates with popular practice management and electronic health record systems. It saves time by selecting exact medications at available doses with built-in support from a drug directory and provides full support for Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances (iCoreEPCS). It protects both the patient and provider by viewing the patient’s complete medication history. It also speeds up the process by allowing the doctor to create a “favorites” list for commonly used medication sets. iCorePDMP is an add-on for iCoreRx that seamlessly integrates with state databases to automate prescription drug monitoring. Providers in many states are required to check the patient’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) history before prescribing controlled substances. This service provides one-click real-time access to the state databases without the need to manually enter data. This tool also generates patient risk scores and an interactive visualization of usage patterns to help the prescriber identify potential risk factors. The prescriber can then use this report to make decisions on objective insight into potential drug misuse or abuse which will ultimately lead to improved patient safety and better patient outcomes.

iCoreVerify and iCoreVerify+ - iCoreVerify is a HIPAA compliant SaaS solution that automatically retrieves a patients insurance eligibility breakdown to verify their benefits seven (7) days in advance of their appointment and on-demand using iCoreConnect’s real time technology. Automation runs daily to verify insurance every patient on the schedule a full week in advance of their appointment date. The system returns results typically in less than one second for most responses. This substantially reduces the phone calls and labor hours for the practice. This tool integrates with most popular practice management systems. iCoreVerify+ adds a unique add-on service that augments iCoreConnect’s automation with a concierge service that turns around requests traditionally in less than 24 hours.  It includes all carriers including non-digital ones and is customized to the client's specialty.

iCoreHuddle and iCoreHuddle+ – iCoreHuddle is a powerful HIPAA compliant SaaS solution to instantly reveal the revenue potential of each patient. This product is currently limited to dental practices. The service connects to most popular practice management and electronic health record systems to optimize revenue realization. It provides the practice with a dashboard containing various metrics, analytics, and key performance indicators (“KPIs”). iCoreHuddle provides a daily view of patient schedules, including their outstanding balances, unscheduled treatment plans, recall information, procedure information and the amount of remaining insurance benefits. The software also provides one-click access to each patient’s insurance eligibility, including a detailed benefits and deductibles report. This tool aims to increase the workflow efficiency of the dentist’s practice by reducing the number of required lookups and clicks for each patient. iCoreHuddle+ offers enhanced analytical tools for practices to optimize their revenue generation process and workflows. 

iCoreCodeGenius – iCoreCodeGenius is a medical coding reference SaaS solution that provides the coding standards for the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), a medical classification list published by the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury and diseases.

iCoreCodeGenius includes a full ICD-10 code lookup and guidance, automatic prompting of comorbidities and Hierarchical Condition Category’s (HCC) to aid in obtaining the appropriate reimbursement with a high degree of accuracy, and the ability to reduce or eliminate queries and denials.

iCoreExchange – iCoreExchange provides a secure, HIPAA compliant SaaS email solution using the direct protocol that allows doctors to send and receive secure email with attachments to and from other healthcare professionals in the network. iCoreExchange also provides a secure email mechanism to communicate with users outside the exchange e.g., patients and referrals. Users have the ability to build a community, access other communities and increase referrals and collaboration. Users can email standard office documents, JPEG, PDF as well as patient files with discrete data, which can then be imported and accessed on most Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Practice Management (PM) systems in a HIPAA compliant manner.

iCoreCloud - iCoreCloud offers customers the ability to backup their on-premise servers and computers to the cloud. iCoreCloud is a fully HIPAA compliant and automated backup solution. The data backed up is encrypted both in transit and while at rest. In case of full data loss, the mirrored data in the cloud can be seamlessly restored back to the practice on a new computer or a server. The data is stored encrypted in HIPAA compliant data centers with multiple layers of redundancy. The data centers are physically secure with restricted personnel and biometric access. The locations are also guarded by security 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

iCorePay – iCorePay offers a seamless patient payment processing solutions for customers. iCorePay integrates into the practice workflow for payment and revenue cycle tracking.

iCoreSecure –We used our expertise and development capabilities from our HIPAA compliant iCoreExchange and developed iCoreSecure, an encrypted email solution for anyone that needs encrypted email to protect personal and financial data. iCoreSecure is a secure SaaS solution that solves privacy concerns in the insurance, real estate, financial and many other industry sectors that have a need for secure encrypted email.

iCoreIT - The trend in IT Services companies for over a decade has been to move away from a “Break/Fix '' model to a “Managed Service Provider (MSP)” and “Managed Software as a Service (MSaaS)” model with recurring revenue. 

Managed IT Services (MSP and MSaaS)

The MSP/MSaaS approach, by using preventative measures, keeps computers and networks up and running while data is accessible and safeguarded. Installation of critical patches and updates to virus protection are automated. Systems are monitored and backed up in real-time. They are fixed or upgraded before they cause a service disruption. A Unified Threat Management solution is deployed to protect against virus, malware, SPAM, phishing and ransomware attacks. Remote technical support is a click away. All support is delivered at a predictable monthly cost.

By leveraging managed services with our expertise in cloud computing, our customers can scale their business without extensive capital investment or disruption in services.

The Company believes it is well positioned to address the growing need for managed services:


· | Our current and future customers need managed IT services, along with cloud computing, storage and HIPAA compliant backup and encryption; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Managed service providers that can support the migration to cloud computing are in high demand; 
· | The decision makers for our current technology and those for managed services are, in many cases, the same person or group of people; 
· | Our management team has decades of experience operating successful IT companies; and the MSP revenue model matches our SaaS and MSaaS MRR (monthly recurring revenue) models.

Competition - The Company experiences competition from a variety of sources with respect to virtually all of its products and services. The Company knows of no single entity that competes with it across the full range of its products and services; however, each of the lines of business in which the Company is engaged is highly competitive. Competition in the markets served is based on several considerations, which may include price, technology, applications, experience, know-how, reputation, service, and distribution. While we believe we offer a unique combination of products and services, a few competitors offer one or more similar products and services in one or more of our niche markets.
Competitive Strengths

The key advantages of our products and services include:

1. Secure, private, scalable, and reliable.

Our services have been designed to provide our customers with privacy and high levels of performance, reliability, and security. We have built, and continue to invest in, a comprehensive security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption for transmission over the Internet, which we monitor and test on a regular basis. We have designed, built, and continue to maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably and cost effectively. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously.

2. Rapid deployment and lower total cost of ownership.

Our services can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing, or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products or other hardware and software. We enable customers to achieve up-front savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract.

3. High levels of user adoption.

We have designed our products and services to be intuitive and easy to use. Our products and services contain many tools and features recognizable to users of popular consumer web services, so users have a more familiar user experience than typical EHR applications. As a result, our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training. We have also designed our products and services to be used on popular mobile devices, making it possible for people to conduct business from their smartphones or tablets.

Competitive Strategy

Key elements of our strategy include:

1. Extending existing service offerings. We continue to innovate based on customer feedback and have designed our solutions to easily accommodate new features and functionality, especially in underserved areas of compliance and improved workflow/profitability for dental and physician practices. We continually look to improve our products and services by adding new features, functions and increased security through our own development, acquisitions, and partnerships.

2. Expanding existing customer relationships. We see significant opportunities to deepen our relationships with our existing customers. As our customers realize the benefits of our products and services, we aim to provide additional value-added products and services.

3. Expanding into new horizontal markets. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, claims coding, billing processing, and electronic prescribing. We drive innovation both organically and through acquisitions.

4. Extending go to market capabilities. We believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size. We continue to pursue businesses of all sizes and industries through our direct sales force and partnerships. In the past several years we have competed and won over 90 major healthcare association endorsements in 26 states. We plan to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ and intend to develop additional distribution channels for our products and services.

In addition to the key elements of our business strategy described above, from time to time, we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights.

Customers

We had no significant customers (greater than 10% of total revenue) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Customer concentration is not significant as the Company has a large number of individual customers. In addition, concentration is reduced by the number of new customers generated through the acquisitions during 2021, as well as through organic growth in both the number of customers and number of services being purchased by new and existing customers. We had accounts receivable concentration with one customer representing 31% of total accounts receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and one customer that represented 33% of accounts receivable outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
Intellectual Property

Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we currently rely on a combination of trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We do not currently own any patents or trademarks.
Government Regulations

We are not currently subject to direct regulation by any government agency, other than regulations applicable to businesses generally, and there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to the access of or commerce on the Internet. However, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the Internet, covering issues such as user privacy, pricing, characteristics, e-mail marketing and quality of products and services. Such laws and regulations could dampen the growth and use of the Internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communication and commercial medium and could thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2022 the Company had 44 employees of which 41 were full-time employees.
