Item 1. Business
Company Overview
EMCORE Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (referred to herein as the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “EMCORE”), was established in 1984 as a New Jersey corporation. The Company became publicly traded in 1997 and is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol EMKR. EMCORE is a leading provider of sensors for navigation in the Aerospace and Defense market as well as a manufacturer of lasers and optical subsystems for use in the cable TV industry.
EMCORE pioneered the linear fiber optic transmission technology that enabled the world’s first delivery of Cable TV directly on fiber, and today is a leading provider of advanced Mixed-Signal Optics products serving the broadband communications and Aerospace and Defense markets. The Mixed-Signal Optics technology at the heart of our broadband communications products is shared with our fiber optic gyros and inertial sensors to provide the aerospace and defense markets with state-of-the-art navigations systems technology. With the acquisition of Systron Donner Inertial, Inc. (“SDI”), a navigation systems provider with a scalable, chip-based platform for higher volume gyro applications utilizing Quartz MEMS technology, in June of 2019, EMCORE further expanded its portfolio of gyros and inertial sensors with SDI’s quartz MEMS gyro and accelerometer technology.
EMCORE has fully vertically-integrated manufacturing capability through our Indium Phosphide (“InP”) compound semiconductor wafer fabrication facility at our headquarters in Alhambra, CA, and through our quartz processing and sensor manufacturing facility in Concord, CA. These facilities support EMCORE’s vertically-integrated manufacturing strategy for quartz and fiber optic gyro products, for Navigation systems, and for our chip, laser, transmitter, and receiver products for broadband applications.
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we had one reporting segment, comprised of three product lines: Navigation Systems, Broadband and Chip Devices. Please see our consolidated financial statements and notes included in this Annual Report for financial information regarding this segment.

For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, as a result of the acquisition of SDI and the increased size and growth expectations of our aerospace and defense business, we expect that we will have two reporting segments, Aerospace and Defense, and Broadband. Aerospace and Defense will be comprised of two product lines: (i) Navigation and Inertial Sensing, and (ii) Defense Optoelectronics. The Broadband segment will be comprised of three product lines: (i) Cable TV Lasers and Transmitters, (ii) Chip Devices, and (iii) Other. Due to a shift in customer base, the previously existing Satellite/Microwave Communications product line has been renamed “Defense Optoelectronics”.
This reporting change, detailing information for these two segments, will go into effect when EMCORE releases our results of operations for the period ending December 31, 2019.
EMCORE’s headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 2015 W. Chestnut Avenue, Alhambra, California, 91803 and our main telephone number is (626) 293-3400.

Strategic Plan
Strategy and Alternatives Committee of the Board of Directors
In addition to organic growth and development of our existing Fiber Optics business, we intend to pursue other strategies to enhance shareholder value. The Strategy and Alternatives Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Strategy Committee"), which was established in December 2013, is charged with overseeing the Company’s strategic plan and evaluating strategic opportunities and alternatives available to the Company, including potential mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other key strategic transactions outside the ordinary course of the Company’s business. Accordingly, the Strategy Committee may from time to time consider strategic opportunities to enhance shareholder value, which may include, at various times depending on the circumstances, acquisitions, investments in joint ventures, partnerships, and other strategic alternatives, such as dispositions, reorganizations, recapitalizations or other similar transactions, the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock or payment of dividends to our shareholders. The Strategy Committee may engage financial and other advisors to assist it in doing so. Accordingly, the Strategy Committee and our management may from time to time be engaged in evaluating potential strategic opportunities and may enter into definitive agreements with respect to such transactions or other strategic alternatives. However, there is no assurance that the Strategy Committee will identify further strategic opportunities that the Company will determine to pursue, or that the consideration of any such opportunity would result in the completion of a strategic transaction. The Strategy Committee met five (5) times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.
Acquisition of Systron Donner Inertial, Inc.
On June 7, 2019, the Company acquired SDI, a private-equity backed navigation systems provider with a scalable, chip-based platform for higher volume gyro applications utilizing QMEMS technology. The total purchase price was approximately $25.0 million, consisting of (i) approximately $22.0 million in cash after working capital adjutments and (ii) the issuance of 811 thousand shares of common stock with an aggregate value of approximately $3.0 million as of the closing date.
Following the closing, we began integrating SDI into our Navigation and Inertial Sensing product line and have included the financial results of SDI in our condensed consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. Net revenue and net loss of SDI from the acquisition date through September 30, 2019 of $9.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, is included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.
Sources of Raw Materials
We depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, and equipment used in our products, though no single supplier of raw materials or components accounts for more than 10% of our aggregate consolidated cost of goods sold. We continually review our supplier relationships to mitigate risks and lower costs, especially where we depend on one or two suppliers for critical components or raw materials. While maintaining inventories that we believe are sufficient to meet our near-term needs, we strive not to carry significant inventories of raw materials. Accordingly, we maintain ongoing communications with our suppliers in order to prevent any interruptions in supply, and have implemented a supply-chain management program to maintain quality and lower purchase prices through standardized purchasing efficiencies and design requirements. To date, we generally have been able to obtain sufficient quantities of critical supplies in a timely manner.
We are subject to rules promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding the use of "conflict minerals". These rules have imposed and will continue to impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to our ability to verify the origin of any "conflict minerals" used in our products.
11

Manufacturing
We utilize MOCVD (metal-organic chemical vapor deposition) systems that are capable of processing virtually all compound semiconductor-based materials. Our operations include wafer fabrication, device design and production and fiber optic module, subsystem and system design and manufacture. Many of our manufacturing operations are computer monitored or controlled to enhance production output and statistical control. We employ a strategy of minimizing ongoing capital investments, while maximizing the variable nature of our cost structure. We maintain supply agreements with key suppliers. Where we can gain cost advantages while maintaining quality and intellectual property control, we outsource the production of certain products, subsystems, components, and subassemblies to contract manufacturers located overseas. Our contract manufacturers maintain comprehensive quality assurance and delivery systems, and we continuously monitor them for compliance. 
Our various manufacturing processes involve extensive quality assurance systems and performance testing. Our facilities have acquired and maintain certification status for their quality management systems. Our manufacturing facilities located in Alhambra, California; and Beijing, China are registered to ISO 9001 standards. Our manufacturing facility located in Concord, California is registered to AS 9100 standards.
As part of the effort to better streamline operations and move to a variable cost model with respect to our Cable TV Lasers and Transmitters product line, on October 25, 2019, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Hytera Communications (Hong Kong) Company Limited, a limited liability company incorporated in Hong Kong (“Hytera HK”), and Shenzhen Hytera Communications Co., Ltd., a corporation formed under the laws of the P.R.C.

Research and Development
Our research and development efforts have been focused on maintaining our technological competitive edge by working to improve the quality and features of our product lines. We are also making investments to expand our existing technology and infrastructure in an effort to develop new products and production technology that we can use to expand into new markets. Our industry is characterized by rapid changes in process technologies with increasing levels of functional integration. Our efforts are focused on designing new proprietary processes and products, on improving the performance of our existing materials, components, and subsystems, and on reducing costs in the product manufacturing process.
As part of the ongoing effort to cut costs, many of our projects have focused on developing lower cost versions of our existing products. In view of the high cost of development, we solicit research contracts that provide opportunities to enhance our core technology base and promote the commercialization of targeted products. Generally, internal research and development funding is used for the development of products that will be released within twelve months and external funding is used for long-term research and development efforts.
We believe that in order to remain competitive, we must invest significant financial resources in developing new product features and enhancements and in maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide. Research and development expense was $19.4 million, $15.4 million and $12.5 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses were 22.3%, 18.0% and 10.2% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our research and development expense consists primarily of compensation expense including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, as well as engineering and prototype costs, depreciation expense, and other overhead expenses, as they relate to the design, development, and testing of our products. These costs are expensed as incurred. 
Intellectual Property and Licensing
We protect our proprietary technology by applying for patents, where appropriate, and in other cases by preserving the technology, related know-how, and information as trade secrets. The success and competitive advantage enjoyed by our product lines depends heavily on our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary technologies. We also acquire, through license grants or assignments, rights to patents on inventions originally developed by others. As of September 30, 2019, we held approximately 76 U.S. patents and approximately 64 foreign patents and had over 9 additional patent applications pending. The issued patents cover various products in the major markets we serve. Our U.S. patents will expire on varying dates between 2020 and 2035. These patents and patent applications claim protection for various aspects of current or planned commercial versions of our materials, components, subsystems, and systems.
We also have entered into license agreements with other organizations, under which we have obtained exclusive or non-exclusive rights to practice inventions claimed in various patents and applications issued or pending in the U.S. or other foreign jurisdictions. We do not believe our financial obligations under any of these agreements adversely affects our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
We rely on trade secrets to protect our intellectual property when we believe that publishing patents would make it easier for others to reverse engineer our proprietary processes. We also rely on other intellectual property rights such as trademarks and copyrights where appropriate.
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning the use, storage, handling, generation, treatment, emission, release, discharge, and disposal of certain materials used in our research and development and production operations, as well as laws and regulations concerning environmental remediation, homeland security, and employee health and safety. The production of wafers and devices involves the use of certain hazardous raw materials, including, but not limited to, ammonia, phosphine, and arsine. We have in-house professionals to address compliance with applicable environmental, homeland security, and health and safety laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental protection laws and regulations. 
13

Competition
The markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, and with respect to certain of our product lines, significant price erosion. We face actual and potential competition from numerous domestic and international companies. Many of these companies have significant engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and financial resources. 
We also sell our products to current competitors and companies with the capability of becoming competitors. As the markets for our products grow, new competitors are likely to emerge and current competitors may increase their market share. In the European Union (“EU”) and certain countries throughout the world, political and legal arrangements encourage the purchase of domestically produced goods, which places us at a disadvantage in those regions or countries.
There are substantial barriers to entry by new competitors across our product lines. These barriers include the large number of existing patents, the time and costs required to develop products, the technical difficulty in manufacturing semiconductor-based products, the lengthy sales and qualification cycles, and the difficulties in hiring and retaining skilled employees with the required scientific and technical backgrounds. We believe that the primary competitive factors within our current markets are product cost, yield, throughput, performance and reliability, breadth of product line, product heritage, customer satisfaction, and customer commitment to competing technologies. Competitors may develop enhancements to or future generations of competitive products that offer superior price and performance characteristics. We believe that in order to remain competitive, we must invest significant financial resources in developing new product features and enhancements and in maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide.
Order Backlog
EMCORE's product sales are made pursuant to purchase orders, often with short lead times. These orders are subject to revision or cancellation and often are made without deposits. For certain of our product categories, products typically ship within the same quarter in which a purchase order is received; therefore, our order backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period and may not be comparable to prior periods.
Seasonality
In certain of our previous fiscal years, we have experienced an increase in revenues in our third and fourth fiscal quarters due to increased sales of our CATV products resulting from an increased build of cable networks during seasons with warmer weather.
Employees
As of September 30, 2019, we had approximately 420 employees, including approximately 101 international employees that are located primarily in China. This represents an increase of approximately 29 employees when compared to September 30, 2018, primarily as a result of the purchase of SDI in June 2019, partially offset by a reduction of headcount in China and the U.S. during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any labor-related work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good.
Competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor industry and fiber optics industries. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is essential to our continued success. We are focused on retaining key contributors, developing our staff, and cultivating their commitment to our Company.
