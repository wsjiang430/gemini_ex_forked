Item 1. Business
General
Xenia Hotels & Resorts, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that primarily invests in uniquely positioned luxury and upper upscale hotels and resorts with a focus on the top 25 lodging markets as well as key leisure destinations in the United States ("U.S.").
Substantially all of the Company's assets are held by, and all the operations are conducted through XHR LP (the "Operating Partnership"). XHR GP, Inc. is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and is wholly-owned by the Company. As of December 31, 2022, the Company collectively owned 97.0% of the common limited partnership units issued by the Operating Partnership ("Operating Partnership Units"). The remaining 3.0% of the Operating Partnership Units are owned by the other limited partners comprised of certain of our executive officers and current or former members of our Board of Directors and includes vested and unvested long-term incentive plan ("LTIP") partnership units. LTIP partnership units may or may not vest based on the passage of time and meeting certain market-based performance objectives.
Xenia operates as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT, the Company cannot operate or manage its hotels. Therefore, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries lease the hotel properties to XHR Holding, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively with its subsidiaries, "XHR Holding"), the Company's taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), which engages third-party eligible independent contractors to manage the hotels. The third-party hotel operators manage each hotel pursuant to a management agreement, the terms of which are discussed in more detail under "Part I-Item 2. Properties - Our Principal Agreements."
The Company's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership, and XHR Holding and each of their wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company's subsidiaries generally consist of limited liability companies ("LLCs"), limited partnerships ("LPs") and our TRS. The effects of all inter-company transactions are eliminated. 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned 32 lodging properties with a total of 9,508 rooms.
The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 200 S. Orange Avenue, Suite 2700, Orlando, Florida, 32801, and our telephone number is (407) 246-8100. The Company’s website is www.xeniareit.com. The information contained on our website, or that can be accessed through our website, neither constitutes part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K nor is incorporated by reference herein.
The following chart shows our structure as of December 31, 2022:
(1)Ownership percentages include vested and unvested LTIP partnership units which may or may not vest based on the passage of time and meeting certain market-based performance objectives.
Ongoing Recovery from COVID-19
Our hotel portfolio experienced a broad-based recovery from COVID-19 during 2022 with a continuation of strong leisure bookings and an acceleration of business transient and group demand. As the recovery continues, we expect that the pace will vary from market to market and may be uneven in nature. 
Business Objectives and Growth Strategies
Our objective is to allocate capital in order to invest primarily in a high-quality diversified portfolio of uniquely positioned luxury and upper upscale hotels and resorts with a focus on the top 25 lodging markets as well as key leisure destinations in the United States. We invest at valuation levels that we believe will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. We pursue this objective through the following investment and growth strategies:
•Follow a Differentiated Investment Strategy Across Targeted Markets. We use our management team’s network of relationships in the lodging industry, real estate brokers and our relationships with multiple hotel brands and management companies, among others, to source acquisition opportunities. When evaluating opportunities, we use a multi-pronged approach to investing that we believe provides us the flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in a variety of markets across any point in the economic cycle. We consider the following characteristics when making investment decisions: 
-    Market Characteristics. We seek opportunities across a range of urban and dense suburban areas, primarily in the top 25 lodging markets as well as key leisure destinations in the U.S. We believe this strategy provides us with a broader range of opportunities and allows us to target markets and sub-markets with particular positive characteristics, such as multiple demand generators, favorable supply and demand dynamics and attractive long-term projected RevPAR growth. We believe assets in the top 25 lodging markets and key leisure destinations in the U.S. present attractive investment opportunities considering the favorable supply and demand dynamics, RevPAR growth trends, attractive valuations and better opportunities for diversification. 
-    Asset Characteristics. We generally pursue uniquely positioned hotels in the luxury and upper upscale segments that are affiliated with leading brands as we believe these segments yield attractive risk-adjusted returns. Within these segments, we seek hotels that will provide guests with a distinctive lodging experience, often tailored to reflect local market environments, which draws demand from both business and leisure transient and group business segments. We seek properties with desirable locations within their markets, exceptional facilities, and other competitive advantages that are hard to replicate. We also favor properties that can be purchased below estimated replacement cost. We believe our focus on uniquely positioned luxury and upper upscale hotel assets allows us to seek appropriate investments that are well-suited for specific markets. 
-    Operational and Structural Characteristics. We pursue both new or recently constructed assets that require limited capital investment, as well as more mature and complex properties with opportunities for our dedicated asset and project management teams to create value through more active operational oversight and targeted capital expenditures.
•Drive Growth Through Aggressive Asset Management, In-House Project Management and Strategic Capital Investment. We believe that investing in our properties and employing a proactive asset management approach designed to identify investment strategies will optimize internal growth opportunities. Our management team’s extensive industry experience across multiple brands and management companies coupled with our integrated asset management and project management teams enable us to identify and implement value-add strategies and to prudently invest capital in our assets to optimize operating results while leveraging best practices across our portfolio.
-    Aggressive Asset Management. Our experienced asset management team focuses on driving property performance through revenue enhancement and cost containment efforts. Our ability to work with a wide variety of management and franchise companies provides us with the opportunity to benchmark performance across our portfolio in order to share best practices. While we do not operate our hotel properties directly, and under the terms of our management agreements our ability to participate in operating decisions regarding our hotels is limited, we conduct regular revenue, sales, and financial performance reviews and also perform in-depth on-site and virtual reviews focused on ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives. We interact frequently with our management companies and on-site management personnel, including conducting regular meetings with key executives of our management companies and brands. We work to maximize the value of our assets through all aspects of the hotel operation and ancillary real estate opportunities. 
-    In-House Project Management. By maintaining a dedicated in-house capital planning and project management team, we believe we are able to develop our capital plans and execute each renovation project at a lower cost and in a timelier manner than if we outsourced these services. In addition, our project management team has extensive experience in the development and renovation of hotel properties, providing both in-depth knowledge of building construction, as well as the opportunity for us to evaluate potential development opportunities. We view this as a significant competitive strength relative to many of our peers. 
-    Strategic Capital Investment to Enhance Portfolio Performance. As part of our ongoing asset management activities, we continuously review opportunities to reinvest in our hotels to maintain quality, increase long-term value and generate attractive returns on invested capital. We may also opportunistically dispose of hotels to take advantage of market conditions or in situations where the hotels no longer fit within our strategic objectives. We believe our breadth of experience and integrated in-house asset management and project management teams are instrumental in our ability to acquire and operate assets and to capitalize on redevelopment opportunities.
Our Financing and Capital Strategy
We strive to maintain a flexible capital structure that puts us in a position to be opportunistic in allocating capital for investment. We seek to maintain a modest amount of leverage and closely monitor our near term debt maturities. Over time, we intend to finance our long-term growth with issuances of common and preferred equity securities, as well as with debt financings utilizing staggered maturities. Our debt includes a revolving credit facility, a corporate credit facility term loan, the Senior Notes, mortgage loans collateralized by our hotel properties, or leasehold interests under the ground leases on our hotel properties, and may include other types of private and public debt in the future. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of $365.9 million of cash on hand, including $60.8 million of restricted cash primarily set aside to maintain our hotels. Our weighted-average debt maturity as of December 31, 2022 was 2.8 years for our mortgage loans, 4.2 years for our corporate credit facility term loan, the Senior Notes, and revolving credit facility and 3.9 years for all debt. Our total debt had a weighted-average interest rate of 5.65%. 
In January 2023, XHR LP (the "Borrower") entered into a new $675 million senior unsecured credit facility comprised of a $450 million revolving line of credit (the “Revolving Line of Credit”), a $125 million term loan (the "Term Loan $125M") and a $100 million delayed draw term loan (the “Term Loan $100M” and, together with the Term Loan $125M, the "2023 Term Loans") pursuant to a Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement, dated as of January 10, 2023, by and among the Borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders and other parties thereto (the “2023 Credit Agreement”). The Revolving Line of Credit and the Term Loan $125M refinanced in full our existing corporate credit facilities, and as a result of such refinancing, the pledges of equity of certain subsidiaries securing obligations under the Amended Credit Agreements and the Senior Notes were released. The Term Loan $100M was funded on January 17, 2023 and was used to repay in full the mortgage loan collateralized by Renaissance Atlanta Waverly Hotel & Convention Center that was due August 2024. Proceeds from future Revolving Line of Credit borrowings may be used for working capital, general corporate or other purposes permitted by the 2023 Credit Agreement. The Revolving Line of Credit matures in January 2027 and can be extended up to an additional year. The interest rate on the Revolving Line of Credit is based on a pricing grid with a range of 145 to 275 basis points over the applicable Term SOFR rate as determined by the Company’s leverage ratio. The 2023 Term Loans mature in March 2026, can be extended up to an additional year, and bear interest rates consistent with the pricing grid on the Revolving Line of Credit. 
Additionally, in January 2023, we amended the mortgage loan collateralized by Andaz Napa to update the variable index on the $55 million loan from LIBOR-based to Term SOFR and extend the maturity date through January 2028.
From time to time, we may also seek to create value for our stockholders by opportunistically repurchasing shares of our common stock at valuations we believe are attractive. In November 2022, the Board of Directors approved an increase to the share repurchase authorization amount by $100 million, thereby increasing our authorization to repurchase up to $275 million of the Company's outstanding common stock (the "Repurchase Program"). Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. This Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of shares. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $166.5 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.
We may also issue new equity or debt and use the proceeds from such issuances to acquire assets, make capital improvements that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns on investment, or for general corporate purposes. We maintain an "at-the-market" program (the "ATM program") available for selling common stock with an aggregate gross offering price of up to $200 million. From time to time we may sell shares under the ATM program to raise capital when we believe conditions are advantageous. 
The ATM program was upsized in May 2021 and had $200 million available for sale as of December 31, 2022. We may issue equity under this program or other equity issuance programs if we determine that shares can be sold at an attractive price and there is a compelling use for such proceeds.
We anticipate using a portion of cash flows generated from operations to fund future acquisitions as well as for property redevelopments, return on investment initiatives, working capital requirements, lease payments and, at times, payment of dividends and share repurchase programs. Subject to market conditions, we intend to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and/or other debt from time to time with proceeds from periodic common and preferred equity issuances, long-term debt financings, sale of assets and cash flows from operations. 
Competition
The U.S. lodging industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels and alternative accommodation options for guests (e.g. those that are found on websites that facilitate short-term rentals of homes and apartments from owners) in each of their markets on the basis of several factors, including, among others, room rates, quality of accommodations, service levels and amenities, location, brand affiliation, reputation and reservation systems. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels and alternative accommodation options. We believe that hotels, which are predominately affiliated with leading brands, such as our portfolio of hotels, will enjoy the competitive advantages associated with operating under such brands, which includes strong health, safety and cleanliness protocols, and are important to our customers. Increased competition could harm our occupancy, RevPAR, ADR and consequently our revenue and may require us to provide additional amenities, or make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, and may materially and adversely affect our operating results and liquidity. 
We face competition for the acquisition of hotels from other REITs, private equity firms, institutional investors, hedge funds, specialty finance companies, insurance companies, governmental bodies, foreign investors and other entities. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and operational resources and access to capital than we have and may have greater knowledge of the markets in which we seek to invest. This competition may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us and decrease the attractiveness of the terms on which we may acquire our targeted hotel investments, including the cost thereof. In addition, these competitors seek financing through the same channels that we do. Therefore, we compete for funding in a market where funds for real estate investment may increase or decrease at a rate that is different than the underlying demand.
Seasonality
The lodging industry is seasonal in nature, which can be expected to cause fluctuations in our rooms revenues, occupancy levels, room rates, operating expenses and cash flows. The periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend upon location, type of property, and competitive mix within the specific location. In a stable macroeconomic environment, our revenues and operating income have historically been highest in the second quarter of the year followed by the first, third and fourth quarters. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continuing recovery has and may continue to disrupt our historical seasonal patterns.
Cyclicality
The lodging industry is cyclical and generally its growth or contraction follows the overall economy. There is a history of increases and decreases in demand for and supply of hotel rooms, in occupancy levels and in rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles and as a result of periodic demand shocks due to economic or other events outside of the lodging industry, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operating results in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Variability of results through some of the cycles in the past has been more severe due to changes in the supply of hotel rooms in given markets or in given segments of hotels. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can cause significant volatility in results for owners of hotel properties. The costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable. Because of this, in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings will be higher than the rate of decline in revenues. Conversely, in an environment of increasing demand and room rates, the rate of increase in earnings is typically higher than the rate of increase in revenues. 
Regulations 
General 
Our hotels are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of our hotels has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Our hotels must comply with applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"), to the extent that such hotels are "public accommodations" as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our hotels where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our hotels are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, non-compliance with the ADA could result in substantial capital expenditures, imposition of fines and/or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one and we will continue to assess our hotels and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Environmental Matters 
Under various laws relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator (including tenants) of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at that property or emanating from that property. These costs could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our hotels may expose us to third-party liability and materially and adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to incur debt using the real estate as collateral.
Our hotels are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and wastewater discharges, lead-based paint, mold and mildew and waste management. Our hotels incur costs to comply with these laws and regulations and could be subject to fines and penalties for noncompliance.
Some of our hotels contain asbestos-containing building materials. We believe that the asbestos is appropriately contained in accordance with current environmental regulations and that we have no need for any immediate remediation or current plans to remove the asbestos. Environmental laws require that owners or operators of buildings with asbestos-containing building materials properly manage and maintain these materials, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. In addition, third-parties may seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.
Some of our hotels may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other adverse conditions, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation. The presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our hotels could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected hotel or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from guests or employees at our hotels and others if property damage or health concerns arise.
Our Tax Status
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("the Code") for U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our short taxable year that commenced on January 5, 2015 and ended on February 3, 2015. We believe that we have been organized and have operated, and will continue to operate, in a manner that will allow us to maintain our REIT status for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with such short taxable year and we intend to continue operating in such a manner. To qualify for REIT status, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains.
We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, in which our hotels are indirectly owned by our Operating Partnership, through subsidiary limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other legal entities. We own and control 100% of the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership and own, directly or indirectly, approximately 97.0% of the Operating Partnership Units in our Operating Partnership, with the remaining 3.0% owned by certain of our executive officers and current or former members of our Board of Directors. In the future, we may issue additional common or preferred units in our Operating Partnership, from time to time, in connection with acquisitions of hotels, financings, compensation or other reasons.
In order for the income from our hotel operations to constitute "rents from real property" for purposes of the gross income tests required for REIT qualification, we cannot directly or indirectly operate any of our hotels. Accordingly, we lease each of our 
hotels, and intend to lease any hotels we acquire in the future, to our TRS lessees. As required for our qualification as a REIT, our TRS lessees have engaged third-party hotel management companies that are eligible independent contractors to manage our hotels on market terms. Our TRS lessees pay rent to us that we intend to treat as "rents from real property". Our TRS, which owns our TRS lessees, is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes applicable to corporations and we are generally subject to sales tax on a portion of the rent paid from our TRS lessees.
Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer of Our Stock 
Our charter authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to enable us to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Furthermore, our charter prohibits any one person or a group (as defined in our charter) from actually or constructively owning more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a person or group (as defined in our charter) from the ownership limits if certain conditions are satisfied. However, our Board of Directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limits to any proposed transferee whose ownership, direct or indirect, in excess of 9.8% of the value or number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock could jeopardize our status as a REIT. These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with such restrictions is no longer required for us to qualify as a REIT. The ownership limits may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might be in our stockholders' best interest.
Insurance
We, or our third-party management companies, carry commercial general liability, commercial property including extended coverage and business interruption, terrorism, cyber risk and umbrella liability coverage on all of our hotels and earthquake, wind, flood, hurricane and environmental coverage on hotels in areas where we believe such coverage is warranted, in each case with deductibles and limits of liability that we believe are adequate. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts we believe to be adequate to reimburse us, on a replacement basis, for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each hotel, including loss of income during the reconstruction period. We have selected policy specifications and insured limits which we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of coverage and industry practice. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses, including, but not limited to, war or acts of God which are not insurable.
Human Capital
Corporate Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 43 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
We are guided by our core values, which include civility, ethics and integrity, and a commitment to quality. These principles continuously serve as a reminder to uphold an inclusive, respectful and tolerant work culture; and to always demonstrate the highest standards of professional conduct. We do not tolerate discrimination in any form and believe equal employment opportunity is a fundamental principle. We maintain policies and programs that provide the framework for fostering and supporting a diverse and inclusive work environment which contribute to the overall corporate culture at Xenia, leading to the recruitment, retention, and growth of a qualified and successful workforce. As of December 31, 2022, our corporate workforce was comprised of approximately 42% women and 40% underrepresented ethnic and racial groups and 72% were 40 years of age or older with an average age of 47.
We believe we offer competitive compensation and benefits programs and frequently benchmark our compensation and benefits package against those in our industry and in similar disciplines. Our benefit programs include an employee stock grant program, health plan options with generous cost-sharing and health savings account contributions, dental, vision, life and disability insurance, a retirement plan with matching employer contributions, tuition reimbursements, qualified parking benefits, significant amounts of paid time off and a remote work policy. We are also committed to cultivating our employees through training and development, including leadership training, professional certifications, continuing education and professional memberships, performance management through annual performance reviews and feedback, health and wellness programs and team-building programs. We have also been recognized as one of America's Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek and by the Orlando Sentinel as a Top 100 Workplace.
Hotel Employees
All persons employed in the day-to-day operations of our hotels are employees of our third-party managers. Employees at certain of our third-party managed hotels are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to review and 
renewal on a regular basis. Many of our third-party managers are publicly traded companies which issue their own respective annual reports with disclosures regarding their human capital policies and objectives and which provide greater detail about their employees and human capital programs and policies. 
Our History
Prior to February 3, 2015, Xenia was a wholly-owned subsidiary of InvenTrust Properties Corp. (formerly known as Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc. or "InvenTrust"), its former parent. On February 3, 2015, Xenia was spun off from InvenTrust through a taxable pro rata distribution by InvenTrust of the outstanding common stock of Xenia to holders of record of InvenTrust's common stockholders as of the close of business on January 20, 2015 (the "Distribution"). In connection with and in order to effectuate the separation and distribution, we and InvenTrust entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, among other agreements. These agreements provided for the allocation between us and InvenTrust of InvenTrust’s assets, liabilities and obligations (including its properties, employees and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after our separation from InvenTrust and governed certain relationships between us and InvenTrust after the separation. On February 4, 2015, Xenia’s Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker symbol "XHR." As a result of the Distribution, the Company became a stand-alone, publicly-traded company.
