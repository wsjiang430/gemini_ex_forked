Item 1.  Business
OVERVIEW
FalconStor Software, Inc. (“FalconStor”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a leading Software-Defined Storage ("SDS") company offering a converged data services software platform that is hardware agnostic which was founded in 2000. As a global company, our vision is to deliver enterprise class, software-defined, intelligent data services combined with predictive analytics across any primary or secondary storage hardware; in the cloud or on premise. The Company's mission is to help IT organizations realize more economic value out of existing environments and any future storage investments while reducing complexity, maximizing flexibility and improving operational efficiency. Our award-winning solutions are available and supported worldwide by OEMs as well as leading service providers, system integrators, resellers and FalconStor.
FalconStor was incorporated in Delaware as Network Peripherals, Inc., in 1994. Pursuant to a merger with FalconStor Inc., in 2001, the former business of Network Peripherals, Inc., was discontinued, and the newly re-named FalconStor Software, Inc., continued the storage software business started in 2000 by FalconStor, Inc. FalconStor’s headquarters are now located at 701 Brazos Street, Suite 400, Austin, TX 78701. The Company also maintains offices in Melville, N.Y., and throughout Europe and Asia Pacific.
FALCONSTOR DATA MASTERY PLATFORM
FalconStor® Data Mastery Platform (FDMP) is FalconStor’s flagship product with what we believe to be the most complete, software-defined, hardware agnostic platform to deliver a truly heterogeneous data services approach. While virtualization has streamlined some common tasks associated with managing data resources, the introduction of a virtualization layer can introduce a whole new level of complexity to the protection, recovery and integration of both virtual and non-virtualized resources. FDMP helps IT organizations minimize and eliminate that complexity with the availability of four specific use cases which include; migration, continuity, protection/recovery and optimization for any storage environment through a single management interface with "Edge-to-Core" analytics.
FalconStor accomplishes this through its Intelligent Abstraction® core, which provides a scalable storage hypervisor, coupled with a data services engine and automation, to ease the provisioning and management of storage resources with the right level of performance, protection and recovery. The Intelligent Abstraction core optimizes storage resources regardless of type, connectivity, brand or speed, into a storage resource pool that can be provisioned to physical or virtual applications, along with common, unified data services across that pool. FDMP is designed to reduce the complexity and time involved in managing disparate underlying storage found in today’s enterprises.
PRODUCT STRATEGY
FalconStor’s strategy is to focus on the development of the advanced FDMP platform to further leverage the company’s industry point solutions as core building blocks. Our existing point products can be utilized via the FDMP platform or as stand-alone products. Our Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery products, Network Storage Server (NSS) and Continuous Data Protector (CDP), feature RecoverTrac, which we believe is the industry’s most automated and complete recovery tool. Our solutions support physical, virtual, hybrid and private cloud environments. We believe a key differentiator is our ability to allow users to manage and to convert across these environments dynamically, giving them the freedom to optimize their IT infrastructure and to eliminate costly vendor and form-factor lock-in. Our Optimized Backup and Deduplication (OBD) product merges our industry-leading Virtual Tape Library (VTL) and File-interface Deduplication System (FDS) solutions to help customers optimize the performance of their existing backup infrastructure, while reducing the cost of underlying storage and data replication. From Fortune 100 enterprises to medium-size businesses, customers across a vast range of industries worldwide have implemented FalconStor solutions in their production IT environments. Whether it is to meet their recovery time objectives (RTO) or their recovery point objectives (RPO), FalconStor helps end users manage their storage infrastructures with minimal total cost of ownership (TCO) and with optimal return on investment (ROI).
FalconStor’s products have been certified by many industry leaders which are available on our website at: www.falconstor.com/certification-matrix.

FDMP
FDMP is an industry leading software-defined, hardware agnostic platform that delivers a heterogeneous data services approach. FDMP helps IT organizations minimize and eliminate the complexity with the delivery of migration, continuity, protection/recovery and optimization services for any storage environment through a single management interface.
This is accomplished through its Intelligent Abstraction core IO engine, which provides a scalable storage hypervisor, coupled with a data services engine and automation, to ease the provisioning and management of storage resources with the right level of performance, protection and recovery. The Intelligent Abstraction core optimizes storage resources regardless of type, connectivity, brand or speed, into a storage resource pool that can be provisioned to physical or virtual applications, along with common, unified data services across that pool. FDMP is designed to reduce the complexity and time involved in managing disparate underlying storage found in today’s enterprise.
FalconStor Network Storage Server (NSS)
FalconStor NSS is a scalable, highly available solution that enables storage virtualization and business continuity in heterogeneous environments. Supporting existing third-party disk arrays, FalconStor NSS eliminates storage boundaries and vendor lock-in, providing fast and easy data storage provisioning and migration. From a small iSCSI virtual server lab to an enterprise-class Fibre Channel SAN running Tier-1 database applications, FalconStor NSS is designed to meet the storage needs of any organization.
Moving data between different storage platforms can be complex, time consuming, and disruptive to business operations. FalconStor’s core storage virtualization technology provides a non-disruptive approach to data mobility across different SAN protocols and vendors. With FalconStor NSS, we believe it becomes a simple operation to move data from older platforms to newer ones or to introduce new storage tiers. This allows organizations to respond to evolving performance and capacity requirements.

FalconStor Continuous Data Protector (CDP)
We believe FalconStor CDP technology reinvents the way data backup and recovery are implemented and performed. Moving beyond failure-prone once-a-day tape backup models, FalconStor CDP combines local and remote protection into a cost-effective, unified, disk-based solution that allows organizations to recover data back to the most recent transaction. Combining application-aware snapshot agents and continuous journaling functions, FalconStor CDP enables customers to recover data to any point in time. FalconStor CDP delivers instant data availability and reliable recovery, bringing business applications back on line in a matter of minutes after a failure. FalconStor CDP protects application-specific data for Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and other business applications, ensuring high performance and stability for even the most complex business environments. 
FalconStor RecoverTrac Disaster Recovery Automation Tool
The FalconStor RecoverTrac disaster recovery automation tool is included as a standard feature of the FalconStor NSS and the FalconStor CDP solutions to automate complex, time-consuming and error-prone failover and failback operations of systems, applications, services, and entire data centers. The RecoverTrac tool streamlines the implementation, testing and execution of DR operations. It minimizes service failover time between sites and reduces DR costs by offering full recovery from physical-to-physical, virtual-to-virtual, and physical-to-virtual server infrastructures. This tool can also convert across those environments, enabling organizations to seamlessly migrate locally, remotely or to and from cloud environments.
FalconStor Optimized Backup and Deduplication (OBD)
The FalconStor OBD solution is one of the industry’s leading virtual tape solutions, and we believe it is unmatched in terms of performance and scalability. With virtual tape, backups complete faster and more reliably, with little or no change needed to the backup environment. It enhances backup operations seamlessly without changing any backup processes or policies. Sophisticated physical tape integration and data security complete the solution. Designed from the start as an enterprise-class application, FalconStor OBD can achieve sustained backup speeds of 20TB per hour per node. Up to eight nodes can combine into a single logical unit, scaling performance to a remarkable 160 TB per hour. This sustained performance allows users to solve the single biggest issue in backup: meeting the backup window. To put that in context, with our latest version 9.x product releases, existing customers can now do the same backup job in 2.8 hours compared with what previously took approximately 8 hours. Unlike our competitors who report peak speeds using multiple nodes, FalconStor notes sustained speeds on a single node and on multiple nodes to ensure customers can achieve real-world performance and do more actual work in less time.
Built-in data deduplication significantly reduces the amount of data needed to be stored on disk. Combined with the latest high-speed protocols, including 8Gb Fibre Channel (FC) and 10Gb Ethernet, we believe FalconStor OBD demonstrates the fastest sustained deduplication speeds in the industry: more than 28 terabytes per hour with inline deduplication and more than 40 terabytes per hour with post processing. Because not all data is alike, we believe FalconStor OBD is the only deduplication solution to offer flexible, deduplication options, letting the customer choose from any combination of four deduplication methods (inline, post-process, concurrent, and no deduplication) to align deduplication processes with business goals and unique requirements. By eliminating redundant backup data, the storage footprint can be reduced by as much as 95%, allowing organizations to keep weeks or even months of data on disk for fast, dependable restore without any of the reliability concerns of a tape-based restore.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
FalconStor continues to position itself as a leader in the Software-Defined Storage market serving enterprise IT organizations and service providers worldwide. FalconStor intends to achieve this objective through the following strategies.
Modernize Existing Enterprise Storage Environments While Protecting Investments 
As IT organizations look to modernize existing infrastructure (either refreshing existing technology or introducing new technologies such as All Flash Arrays (AFAs) and Cloud), they are challenged by the cost, risk, and the disruption upgrades and migrations can cause. Because FDMP abstracts the data services from the physical storage infrastructure, additional capabilities can be added to legacy hardware, eliminating the need and cost to replace that hardware. This delivers discrete value in terms of lowering capital and operational costs, reduced risk and disruption and significantly faster time to deployment. For IT organizations needing to deploy new hardware or storage paradigms such as all AFAs and Cloud, FDMP enables the migration of data and workloads to those new platforms, versus being forced to start with a new or “greenfield” deployment required by many of the new HW vendors. FDMP offers these organizations a path forward with an approach that minimizes or eliminates risk and disruption to business processes and workflows, while lowering both capital and operational costs.

FalconStor intends to continue to leverage the protocol-independent, unified architecture, analytics and robust open data services technology of its solution to maintain a leadership position in the enterprise storage software market. FalconStor plans to continue its leadership in this market through its deep commitment to research and development and through continued rapid technology innovation. For information on our research and development expenditures, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Enable Service Providers
As the service provider segment continues to grow, they increasingly have a need to support heterogeneous storage environments across their own datacenters and their customer’s environments. Further, they often have different hardware and software capabilities, making it significantly challenging to offer consistent data services across these environments. We believe FDMP offers several strategic benefits for service providers:

• | Seamlessly and non-disruptively move data from the customer premise to the service provider’s hosted environment;


• | Offers common data services across customer’s environments regardless of underlying hardware or technology;


• | Allows for the introduction and ability to monetize additional data services they may not have previously been able to offer;


• | Provides a low-cost growth opportunity due to the flexibility of FDMP licensing, while eliminating the need to have multiple feature licenses array by array;


• | Realize reduced storage management complexity and costs within their own infrastructure by eliminating silos, reducing licensing costs and optimizing hardware with FDMP;


• | Optimize storage hardware based on price/performance needs of customers; and


• | Analytics provide the necessary real-time and historical information to achieve SLA's and make economic decisions.

Expand Software and Hardware Strategic Alliances with Industry Leaders
The Flash/SSD market should be a key opportunity for us on two fronts: targeting customers wanting to integrate new Flash/SSD technology into existing IT environments; and OEMs needing to enhance their software stack in order to offer data movement and protection services on their platform. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) such as AWS, Azure and Aliyun also represent a growth opportunity. Our mutual customers and partners need help moving data from the customer site to their own facilities as well as a way to deliver common data services across disparate and often incompatible hardware typically found across the provider and end customer environments. We believe FalconStor is positioned to continue to take advantage of these key opportunities in the global marketplace. Our strategic relationships with Dell, DSI, Fujitsu, Hitachi Data Systems, HP, Huawei, Kaminario, X-IO and others should fuel growth across all three major geographies.

MARKETING
We re-focused our efforts to increase awareness and demand for FalconStor products during 2018 by targeting our efforts at our extensive installed base. Partner and end-user re-engagement was encouraging during the second half of 2018 and we believe it will serve to create momentum for our growth and product innovation efforts.
COMPETITION
As data has become as critical an asset as capital and labor, the entrants into the data management and data protection segments continue to rise, as does the demand for services and integration with emerging technologies. Although there are several companies attempting to offer data protection for specific environments, FalconStor believes that only software-defined storage providers are capable of delivering a high level of data protection services across the data center, crossing the infrastructure boundaries between virtual, physical and hybrid environments. FalconStor holds multiple patents on key technologies that enable and optimize our snapshots, data protection, and data reduction platform. We believe that our integrated services and products based on our common storage virtualization platform - including CDP, NSS, OBD, WAN-optimized replication for remote offices and data centers, and disaster recovery automation - are unique to the industry.
Although some of FalconStor’s products provide capabilities that put them in competition with products from a number of companies, FalconStor is not aware of any other software company providing the same level of data protection and recovery capabilities for both physical and virtual infrastructures in a common solution. FalconStor believes that the principle competitive factors enhancing its marketability include product features, such as scalability, high availability, price, reliability, hardware/platform neutrality, and customer service and support.
As FalconStor refines its focus on enterprise and service provider market segments, the products and services offered by its partners may compete with existing or new products and services offered by current and new entrants to the market.
FalconStor’s future and existing competitors could conceivably introduce products with superior features, scalability and functionality at lower prices than FalconStor products. They could also bundle existing or new products with other more established products to compete with FalconStor. Increased competition could result in price reductions and reduced gross margins, which in turn could impact FalconStor’s business. FalconStor’s success will depend largely on its ability to generate market demand and awareness of its products and to enhance or develop new products and services in a timely manner.

When we sell to customers, the competitors we encounter most frequently are HP, Dell, Hitachi Data Systems, IBM, DataCore and a number of niche players. Many of these competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
FalconStor’s success is dependent in part upon its proprietary technology. The IPStor platform forms the core of this proprietary technology. FalconStor currently has twenty-seven patents and numerous pending patent applications. The Company has multiple registered trademarks - including “FalconStor Software”, “IPStor”, “FDMP” and “Intelligent Abstraction” - as well as pending trademark applications related to FalconStor and its products.
FalconStor seeks to protect its proprietary rights and other intellectual property through a combination of copyright, patents, trademark, and trade secret protection, as well as through contractual protections such as proprietary information agreements and nondisclosure agreements. The technological and creative skills of its personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership.
FalconStor generally enters into confidentiality or license agreements with employees, consultants, and corporate partners and generally controls access to and distribution of its software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Despite the Company’s efforts to protect its proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use FalconStor’s products or technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of FalconStor’s products is difficult, and there can be no assurance that the steps FalconStor has taken will prevent misappropriation of its technology, particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect its proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
On October 9, 2018, we closed on the final tranche of our previously-announced private placement of Units (as hereinafter defined) to certain eligible stockholders of the Company (the “Financing”). As a result, the Company received an additional $1,000,000 of gross proceeds from new investors (the “New Investors”) which is in addition to the $3,000,000 of gross proceeds previously received from HCP-FVA, LLC (“HCP-FVA”) pursuant to a commitment (the “Commitment”) through the subscription of 30,000,000 Units. HCP-FVA is an affiliate of Hale Capital Partners, LP (together with HCP-FVA, “Hale Capital”), the Company’s largest stockholder through its ownership of the Company’s Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) Common Stock, $.001 par value (the “Common Stock”), and an affiliate of FalconStor director, Martin Hale
In the Financing, the Company offered to FalconStor stockholders as of November 17, 2017 who are accredited investors the opportunity to purchase up to a total of 40 million Units (inclusive of subscriptions by HCP-FVA). Each Unit consisted of the following (each, a “Unit”) for a per Unit offering price of $0.371063:

(i) | $0.10 in senior secured debt (for a total of $4 million of senior secured debt assuming full subscription of the

8

Financing), secured by all of the assets of the Company and guaranteed by each of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries, having an interest rate of prime plus 0.75% and a maturity date of June 30, 2021 (the “Term Loan”);

(ii) | warrants to purchase 12.233 shares of the Company’s Common Stock for a nominal exercise price (for a total of approximately 489.32 million shares assuming full subscription of the Financing) (the “Financing Warrants”); and


(iii) | 0.0225 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a per Unit price of $0.271063, all such shares to be acquired directly from their current holder, HCP-FVA.

In addition to providing the Company with $1,000,000 of financing, the New Investors purchased $520,000 of the Term Loan held by HCP-FVA and 342,000 of the 900,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by HCP-FVA. Financing Warrants to purchase 63,610,935 shares of Common Stock held by HCP-FVA were also cancelled. Accordingly, the New Investors hold Financing Warrants to purchase 185,942,009 shares of Common Stock and HCP- FVA now holds Financing Warrants to purchase 303,379,065 shares of Common Stock. The transfer of securities by HCP-FVA to New Investors was subject to certain transfer limitations to ensure the preservation of the Company’s net operating loss carry forward.
All New Investors executed a joinder to the Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of February 23, 2018 (the “Amended and Restated Loan Agreement”), with HCP-FVA, the Company and certain other loan parties named therein setting forth the terms of the Term Loan. The terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement have been previously described in the Company’s SEC filings
As part of the Commitment, Hale Capital also agreed to postpone the date of the mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock from August 5, 2017 to July 30, 2021, and to waive prior breaches of the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock which had also triggered a mandatory redemption right.
In connection with the Commitment and providing initial bridge financing, HCP-FVA received Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 55,436,510 shares (the “Backstop Warrants”) of which 53,892,880 Backstop Warrants have been exercised. The Backstop Warrants and the Financing Warrants are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the “Warrants." 
The Financing was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, based on a recommendation of a special committee of independent directors, with Mr. Hale recusing himself.
As previously disclosed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company was actively seeking financing in order to meet the Company’s operating cash flow needs.
In December 2018,  outstanding Financing Warrants to purchase 489,321,074 were exercised resulting in the issuance of 489,321,074 shares of Common Stock (the “Warrant Exercise”). In connection with the Warrant Exercise, the Company received proceeds of approximately $489,321 which was used to reduce the outstanding principal due on Amended and Restated Loan Agreement.
