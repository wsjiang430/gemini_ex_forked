ITEM 1.
 BUSINESS
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on January 21, 2011. Since our incorporation, we have attempted to become involved in a number of business ventures, all of which were unsuccessful and which we have abandoned.

In February 2018, we decided to become involved in the marijuana industry.

We now plan to own and operate medical and adult marijuana cultivation facilities, manufacturing facilities and dispensaries in California. The first step in our business plan is to acquire licenses to cultivate, manufacture and dispense marijuana. 

On March 20, 2019 we entered into a Letter of Intent with an unrelated third party concerning marijuana licenses in Los Angeles County. The Letter of Intent provides that we will pay $850,000 for licenses to cultivate, manufacture and distribute marijuana in California. However we will not acquire any aspects of the licenses that relate to retail delivery or store front retail.

The acquisition of the licenses is subject to a number of conditions, including a requirement that the licenses, which expired in June 2018, to be renewed by the government authorities which issued the licenses.

If the licenses are acquired, we plan to construct a cultivation, manufacturing and distribution facility in Los Angeles County and sell marijuana throughout California.

If we acquire these licenses, we estimate that it will require 4 months and cost $145,000 to build and equip the cultivation, manufacturing and distribution facility in Los Angeles County.

We do not intend to acquire a license associated with a facility or dispensary which is, or was, in operation.

We may also apply for a marijuana cultivation, manufacturing or dispensary license in our own name.

California state law requires that all commercial cannabis businesses, including cultivators, dispensaries, delivery services, extractors, concentrate, edible and topical manufacturers, distributors, and testing laboratories hold a state license in order to operate. Marijuana in California is legal for both medical and recreational use. However, retailers need separate licenses to sell medical and recreational marijuana.

CalCannabis Cultivation Licensing, a division of the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), licenses and regulates commercial cannabis cultivators in California. CalCannabis also manages the state's track-and-trace system, which tracks all commercial cannabis and cannabis productsfrom cultivation to sale. Any person or entity who wishes to engage in commercial cannabis cultivation must submit an application package, which includes a completed application form, all required documentation and a non-refundable application fee.

The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) is the lead agency in regulating commercial cannabis licenses for medical and adult-use cannabis in California. The Bureau is responsible for licensing retailers, distributors, testing labs, and temporary cannabis events.

The Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch, a division of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), is responsible for regulating and licensing the manufacturers of cannabis-infused edibles for both medical and nonmedical use.

The first step in obtaining licensing for a cannabis business in California is selecting a location or locations for the business since state licensing requires that a business have approval from the local government where the business is located. The permitting process, fees, and tax rates vary tremendously and local city and county governments can restrict or ban cannabis businesses in their jurisdiction. Every location has different rules on where cannabis businesses can locate, based on zoning, proximity to schools and other sensitive locations, and types of licenses allowed.

Market Conditions
 
Marijuana sales in North America reached $7.97 billion in 2017, compared to $6.73 billion in 2016, according to ArcView Market Research/BDS Analytics. The research firm projects sales to jump to $21.6 billion by 2021, representing a 26% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).

 Adult-Use marijuana is now legal in ten states and the District of Columbia, and medical marijuana is legal in 30 states.
 
While the industry is growing rapidly, the cannabis industry faces major obstacles that challenge its growth and profitability. First, the cultivation of cannabis is a very capital-intensive enterprise. Many cannabis entrepreneurs do not have access to the capital required to build the infrastructure required to meet growing demand and sales projections. Traditional sources of financing, such as banks, are not available currently to cannabis producers and retailers. Second, as explained below, marijuana is illegal under federal law.

Federal Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law.  Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.

A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse.  However, the Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.  If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
As of March 25, 2019, 30 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use medical marijuana.  Additionally, 10 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for recreational use by adults.  However, the state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. 

The previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. In this regard, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration issued a memorandum (the Cole Memo) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA.

The Cole Memo noted that the Department of Justice is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provided guidance to Department of Justice attorneys and law

enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following in preventing:

·
 the distribution of cannabis to minors;
 ·
 revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;
 ·
 the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law to states where it is not legal;
 ·
 state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
 ·
 violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis;
 ·
 drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use;
 ·
 the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and
 ·
 cannabis possession or use on federal property.

On January 4, 2018, the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the Sessions Memo stating that the Cole Memo was rescinded effectively immediately. In particular, Mr. Sessions stated that prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions, which require federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. Mr. Sessions went on to state in the memorandum that previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately. 

It is unclear at this time whether the Sessions Memo indicates that the Trump administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement.

However, on March 30, 2018 President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion budget bill that includes a provision that prevents the Justice Department, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, from using funds to arrest or prosecute patients, caregivers and businesses that are acting in compliance with state medical marijuana laws. This provision, known as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to interfere with state medical marijuana programs.

Competition
 
Currently, there are many other companies that are involved in the marijuana industry, many of which we consider to be our competition. Many of these companies have business plans similar to ours.  We expect that other companies will recognize the value of serving the marijuana industry and become our competitors.
General
 
On October 15, 2018 a shareholder owning a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock amended our Articles of Incorporation to:

·
 change our name to Pierre Corp.; and
 ·
 reverse split our outstanding shares of common stock on a 5-for-1 basis.

Our office is located at 750 N. San Vicente, Suite 800 West, West Hollywood, California 90069 and are rented for $1,800 per month. 
 
As of March 25, 2019, we did not have any full time employees.
