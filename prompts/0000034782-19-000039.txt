OTHER CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
We have other subsidiaries that are not significant to the consolidated entity.
1ST SOURCE MASTER TRUST
Our unconsolidated subsidiary includes 1st Source Master Trust. This subsidiary was created for the purpose of issuing $57.00 million of trust preferred securities and lending the proceeds to 1st Source. We guarantee, on a limited basis, payments of distributions on the trust preferred securities and payments on redemption of the trust preferred securities.
COMPETITION
The activities in which we and the Bank engage are highly competitive. Our businesses and the geographic markets we serve require us to compete with other banks, some of which are affiliated with large bank holding companies headquartered outside of our principal market. We generally compete on the basis of client service and responsiveness to client needs, available loan and deposit products, the rates of interest charged on loans and leases, the rates of interest paid for funds, other credit and service charges, the quality of services rendered, the convenience of banking facilities, and in the case of loans and leases to large commercial borrowers, relative lending limits.
In addition to competing with other banks within our primary service areas, the Bank also competes with other financial service companies, such as credit unions, industrial loan associations, securities firms, insurance companies, small loan companies, finance companies, mortgage companies, real estate investment trusts, certain governmental agencies, credit organizations, and other enterprises.
Additional competition for depositors’ funds comes from United States Government securities, private issuers of debt obligations, and suppliers of other investment alternatives for depositors. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive Federal and State regulations that govern bank holding companies and banks. Such non-bank competitors may, as a result, have certain advantages over us in providing some services.
We compete against these financial institutions by being convenient to do business with, and by taking the time to listen and understand our clients’ needs. We deliver personalized, one-on-one banking through knowledgeable local members of the community always keeping the clients’ best interest in mind while offering a full array of products and highly personalized services. We rely on our history and our reputation in northern Indiana dating back to 1863.
EMPLOYEES
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,150 employees on a full-time equivalent basis. We provide a wide range of employee benefits and consider employee relations to be good.

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
1st Source embraces our responsibility to be a good steward of the environment. We have an approach that protects and conserves our natural resources though methods such as:
Developing business practices that protect and conserve natural resources — We use responsible, reputable, and monitored e-recyclers for our electronic assets. All computers, including desktops, laptops, and monitors, are properly recycled.
We are conscious of our paper usage, recognizing that we depend on printed materials for important day-to-day office work, client communications, and acquiring new clients. Increasingly, consumers demand more environmentally sustainable options and prefer online statements and correspondence rather that printed materials. The majority of the paper used in our facilities is recycled through our secure shred program and in 2018 we recycled 268,000 pounds of paper.
Additionally, we are utilizing various sustainable practices in some of our facilities such as LED lights, daylight harvesting sensors, programmable thermostats, 95% or higher efficiency furnace systems, drip irrigation, 90% recycled mats, and sustainable landscaping and irrigation systems. In an effort to reduce our carbon footprint, we will utilize solar panels in two of our banking centers for supplemental sustainable power. These banking centers expect to supplement approximately 20% of their total electrical usage with renewable solar power. 
Embracing opportunities for new products, services and partnerships — In 2018, we continued our focus on renewable energy sources through lending and investment partnerships with renewable energy providers. We recognize the opportunities and complexities associated with energy financing and understand the value of innovative technology that leverages the wind and sun, which are sustainable from an environmental and financial perspective. We will continue to finance and invest in sustainable opportunities, and we will explore new opportunities to develop products and solutions that support our clients and advance sustainability.
Adopting new technologies — We encourage our clients to take advantage of our online and mobile banking tools. Our ATM devices allow clients to make deposits without the need for an envelope. This reduces the use of paper, which again reduces emissions throughout our supply chain.
To help reduce emissions associated with travel, we have tools that help clients choose the banking center and ATM’s closest to them. In addition, mobile deposit features are available to our clients, enabling them to deposit checks into their accounts using their mobile devices.
Many of these approaches can create long-term value for our clients and shareholders through increased revenues, reduced costs and improved convenience.
REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
General — 1st Source and the Bank are extensively regulated under Federal and State law. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and our prospective business. Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and by the policies of various regulatory authorities. We are unable to predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, economic controls, or new Federal or State legislation may have in the future.
We are a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHCA), and, as such, we are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). We are required to file annual reports with the Federal Reserve and to provide the Federal Reserve such additional information as it may require.
The Bank, as an Indiana state bank and member of the Federal Reserve System, is supervised by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) and the Federal Reserve. As such, 1st Source Bank is regularly examined by and subject to regulations promulgated by the DFI and the Federal Reserve. Because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides deposit insurance to the Bank, we are also subject to supervision and regulation by the FDIC (even though the FDIC is not our primary Federal regulator).
Bank Holding Company Act — Under the BHCA our activities are limited to business so closely related to banking, managing, or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. We are also subject to capital requirements applied on a consolidated basis in a form substantially similar to those required of the Bank. The BHCA also requires a bank holding company to obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring, or holding more than 5% voting interest in any bank or bank holding company, (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.
5

The BHCA also restricts non-bank activities to those which, by statute or by Federal Reserve regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks. As discussed below, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which was enacted in 1999, established a distinct type of bank holding company known as a “financial holding company” that has powers that are not otherwise available to bank holding companies.
Capital Standards — The Federal bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in their examination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks. If capital falls below the minimum levels established by these guidelines, a bank holding company or bank must submit an acceptable plan for achieving compliance with the capital guidelines and, until its capital sufficiently improves, will be subject to denial of applications and appropriate supervisory enforcement actions. The various regulatory capital requirements that we are subject to are disclosed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies approved final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for all U.S. banks and for bank holding companies with greater than $500 million in assets. Under these final rules, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by 1st Source and the Bank. The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. The final rules also require a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. A three-year phase in period for the capital buffer requirement began in 2016. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5%, and the total capital ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis. 
The final rules also increase the required capital for certain categories of assets, including higher-risk construction real estate loans and certain exposures related to securitizations. The final rules do not, however, adopt the changes in the proposed rule to the risk weights assigned to certain mortgage loan assets. The final rules instead adopt the risk weights for residential mortgages under the existing general risk-based capital rules, which assign a risk weight of either 50% (for most first-lien exposures) or 100% for other residential mortgage exposures. Similarly, the final rules do not adopt the proposed rule’s elimination of Tier 1 treatment of trust preferred securities for banking organizations with less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2010. Instead, the final rules permit these banking organizations to retain non-qualifying Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, subject generally to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital.
These new minimum capital ratios became effective for us on January 1, 2015 and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements. Management also believes that, as of that date, we would have met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis had those requirements been currently in effect. 
Prompt Corrective Action Regulations — The FDIC’s prompt corrective action regulations establish five capital levels for financial institutions (“well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized”), and impose mandatory regulatory scrutiny and limitations on institutions that are less than adequately capitalized. At December 31, 2018, the Bank was categorized as “well capitalized,” meaning that our total risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10.00%, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio exceeded 8.00%, our common equity Tier-1 risk-based capital ratio exceeded 6.50%, our leverage ratio exceeded 5.00%, and we are not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments —The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, changed how the FDIC calculates deposit insurance premiums payable by insured depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FDIC to calculate the deposit insurance assessments payable by each insured depository institution based generally upon the institution’s average total consolidated assets minus its average tangible equity during the assessment period. Previously, an institution’s assessments were based on the amount of its insured deposits. The minimum deposit insurance fund rate will increase from 1.15% to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and the cost of the increase will be borne by depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides the FDIC with discretion to determine whether to pay rebates to insured depository institutions when its deposit insurance reserves exceed certain thresholds.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and The NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ) — We are under the jurisdiction of the SEC and certain state securities commissions for matters relating to the offering and sale of our securities and our investment advisory services. We are subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. We are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol “SRCE,” and we are subject to the rules of NASDAQ for listed companies.

Interstate Branching — The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the authority of a state or national bank to open offices in other states. A state or national bank may now open a de novo branch in a state where the bank does not already operate a branch if the law of the state where the branch is to be located would permit a state bank chartered by that state to open the branch. This provision removed restrictions under prior law that restricted a state or national bank from expanding into another state unless the laws of the bank’s home state and the laws of the other state both permitted out-of-state banks to open de novo branches.
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 — The GLBA removed barriers to affiliations among banks, insurance companies, the securities industry, and other financial service providers, and provides greater flexibility to these organizations in structuring such affiliations. The GLBA also expanded the types of financial activities a bank may conduct through a financial subsidiary and established a distinct type of bank holding company, known as a financial holding company, which may engage in an expanded list of activities that are “financial in nature.” These activities include securities and insurance brokerage, securities underwriting, insurance underwriting, and merchant banking. A bank holding company may become a financial holding company only if all of its subsidiary financial institutions are well-capitalized and well-managed and have at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating. While we meet these standards, we do not currently intend to file notice with the Federal Reserve to become a financial holding company or to engage in expanded financial activities through a financial subsidiary of the Bank. The GLBA also includes privacy protections for nonpublic personal information held by financial institutions regarding their customers, and establishes a system of functional regulation that makes the Federal Reserve the “umbrella supervisor” for holding companies, and other federal and state agencies the supervisor of the holding company’s subsidiaries. 
Financial Privacy — In accordance with the GLBA, Federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about customers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third-party. The privacy provisions of the GLBA affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. We are also subject to various state laws that generally require us to notify any customer whose personal financial information may have been released to an unauthorized person as the result of a breach of our data security policies and procedures.
USA Patriot Act of 2001 — The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act) substantially broadened the scope of anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations on financial institutions. The regulations adopted by the Treasury under the USA Patriot Act require financial institutions to maintain appropriate controls to combat money laundering activities, perform due diligence of private banking and correspondent accounts, establish standards for verifying customer identity, and provide records related to suspected anti-money laundering activities upon request from federal authorities. A financial institution’s failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches, and could also have other serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations.
Regulations Governing Capital Adequacy — The Federal bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in their examination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks. If capital falls below the minimum levels established by these guidelines, a bank holding company or bank will be required to submit an acceptable plan for achieving compliance with the capital guidelines and will be subject to denial of applications and appropriate supervisory enforcement actions. The various regulatory capital requirements that we are subject to are disclosed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Community Reinvestment Act — The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their jurisdiction, the Federal banking regulators must evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those banks. Federal banking regulators are required to consider a financial institution’s performance in these areas as they review applications filed by the institution to engage in mergers or acquisitions or to open a branch or facility.
Regulations Governing Extensions of Credit — The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to 1st Source or our subsidiaries, or investments in our securities and on the use of our securities as collateral for loans to any borrowers. These regulations and restrictions may limit our ability to obtain funds from the Bank for our cash needs, including funds for acquisitions and for payment of dividends, interest and operating expenses. Further, the BHCA, certain regulations of the Federal Reserve, state laws and many other Federal laws govern the extensions of credit and generally prohibit a bank from extending credit, engaging in a lease or sale of property, or furnishing services to a customer on the condition that the customer obtain additional services from the bank’s holding company or from one of its subsidiaries.
7

The Bank is also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, or any related interest of such persons. Extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, and subject to credit underwriting procedures that are at least as stringent as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non affiliates, and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. The Bank is also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons.
Reserve Requirements — The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction account deposits. For 2019, the Bank must maintain reserves of 3.00% against net transaction accounts greater than $16.30 million and up to $124.20 million (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve) and reserves of 10.00% must be maintained against that portion of net transaction accounts in excess of $124.20 million. These amounts are indexed to inflation and adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve.
Dividends — The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is limited by state and Federal laws and regulations that require the Bank to obtain the prior approval of the DFI and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago before paying a dividend that, together with other dividends it has paid during a calendar year, would exceed the sum of its net income for the year to date combined with its retained net income for the previous two years. The amount of dividends the Bank may pay may also be limited by certain covenant agreements and by the principles of prudent bank management. See Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for further discussion of dividend limitations.
Monetary Policy and Economic Control — The commercial banking business in which we engage is affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing, availability of borrowing at the “discount window,” open market operations, the imposition of changes in reserve requirements against member banks’ deposits and assets of foreign branches, and the imposition of, and changes in, reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve. These monetary policies are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distributions of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and such use may affect interest rates charged on loans and leases or paid on deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to do so in the future. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve are influenced by various factors, including economic growth, inflation, unemployment, short-term and long-term changes in the international trade balance, and in the fiscal policies of the U.S. Government. Future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on our future business and earnings, and the effect on the future business and earnings of the Bank cannot be predicted.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 — The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOA) includes provisions intended to enhance corporate responsibility and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws, and which increase penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at public traded companies. The SOA generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act.
Among other things, the SOA creates the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as an independent body subject to SEC supervision with responsibility for setting auditing, quality control, and ethical standards for auditors of public companies. The SOA also requires public companies to make faster and more-extensive financial disclosures, requires the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of public companies to provide signed certifications as to the accuracy and completeness of financial information filed with the SEC, and provides enhanced criminal and civil penalties for violations of the Federal securities laws.
The SOA also addresses functions and responsibilities of audit committees of public companies. The statute, by mandating certain stock exchange listing rules, makes the audit committee directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of the company’s outside auditor, and requires the auditor to report directly to the audit committee. The SOA authorizes each audit committee to engage independent counsel and other advisors, and requires a public company to provide the appropriate funding, as determined by its audit committee, to pay the company’s auditors and any advisors that its audit committee retains. The SOA also requires public companies to prepare an internal control report and assessment by management, along with an attestation to this report prepared by the company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in their annual reports to stockholders.

Consumer Financial Protection Laws — The Bank is subject to a number of federal and state consumer financial protection laws and regulations that extensively govern its transactions with consumers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Service Members Civil Relief Act. 1st Source Bank must also comply with applicable state usury laws and other laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and the terms of deposit accounts, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, restrict the Bank’s ability to raise interest rates and subject the Bank to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of these laws may expose us to liability from potential lawsuits brought by affected customers. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce these consumer financial protection laws, in which case we may be subject to regulatory sanctions, civil money penalties, and customer rescission rights. Failure to comply with these laws may also cause the Federal Reserve or DFI to deny approval of any applications we may file to engage in merger and acquisition transactions with other financial institutions. 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act — The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in 2010, significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that profoundly affected the regulation of community banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies. Among other things, these provisions relaxed rules on interstate branching, allow financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, and impose heightened capital requirements on bank and thrift holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act also includes several corporate governance provisions that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions. These include provisions mandating certain disclosures regarding executive compensation and provisions addressing proxy access by shareholders.
The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve and transferred to the CFPB primary responsibility for administering substantially all of the consumer compliance protection laws formerly administered by other federal agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the CFPB to promulgate consumer protection regulations that will apply to all entities, including banks, that offer consumer financial services or products. It also includes a series of provisions covering mortgage loan origination standards affecting, among other things, originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, and pre-payment penalties. 
The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types, including some that may affect our business in substantial and unpredictable ways. We have incurred higher operating costs in complying with the Dodd -Frank Act, and we expect that these higher costs will continue for the foreseeable future. Our management continues to monitor the ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and as new regulations are issued, will assess their effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The Volcker Rule — The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The provision of the statute imposing these restrictions is commonly called the “Volcker Rule.” The regulations implementing the Volcker Rule require institutions to conform their activities to the requirements of the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015, and to conform their investments in certain “legacy covered funds” by July 21, 2017. These regulations exempt the Bank, as a bank with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets that does not engage in any covered activities other than trading in certain government, agency, state or municipal obligations, from any significant compliance obligations under the Volcker Rule.
Liquidity Requirements — Historically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III final framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio, or NSFR, is designed to promote more medium and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements are expected to incentivize banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source.
In September 2015, the federal bank regulators approved final rules implementing the LCR for advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e,. banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure) and a modified version of the LCR for bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approach banking organizations, neither of which would apply to 1st Source or the Bank. The federal bank regulators have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR, but the Federal Reserve has stated its intent to adopt a version of this measure as well.

2018 Regulatory Reform — In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Regulatory Relief Act), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Regulatory Relief Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory changes for the Bank and 1st Source.
The Regulatory Relief Act, among other things, expands the definition of qualified mortgages a financial institution may hold and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8% and 10%. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds this community bank leverage ratio will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory requirements. Further, any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be “well capitalized” for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules. In addition, the Regulatory Relief Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the proprietary trading prohibitions in the Volcker Rule, mortgage disclosures, and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Regulatory Relief Act will ultimately be applied to the Bank or 1st Source or what specific impact the Regulatory Relief Act and the yet-to-be-written implementation rules and regulations will have on the Bank or 1st Source.
Pending Legislation — Because of concerns relating to competitiveness and the safety and soundness of the banking industry, Congress often considers a number of wide-ranging proposals for altering the structure, regulation, and competitive relationships of the nation’s financial institutions. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposals will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected.
