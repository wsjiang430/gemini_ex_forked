 Item 1. Business
Overview
Founded in 1997, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BioMarin, we, us or our) is a global biotechnology company dedicated to transforming lives through genetic discovery. We develop and commercialize targeted therapies that address the root cause of genetic conditions. Our robust research and development capabilities have resulted in multiple innovative commercial therapies for patients with rare genetic disorders. Our distinctive approach to drug discovery has produced a diverse pipeline of commercial, clinical, and pre-clinical candidates that address a significant unmet medical need, have well-understood biology, and provide an opportunity to be first-to-market or offer a substantial benefit over existing treatment options. 
Recent Developments 
In 2022, we achieved nearly $2.1 billion in total revenues, including a significant contribution from our ongoing launch of VOXZOGO, and we continued making important advancements in our product development pipeline. Our key business developments since the beginning of 2022 include the conditional approval of ROCTAVIAN (formerly referred to as valoctocogene roxaparvovec) in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of severe hemophilia A in adult patients, our release of positive three-year data from our Phase 3 study of ROCTAVIAN, the acceptance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of our resubmission of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for ROCTAVIAN, and approvals of VOXZOGO in Australia for patients with achondroplasia ages two and older and in Japan for children with achondroplasia of all ages. We also continued progress in our earlier stage clinical programs, BMN 255 for the treatment of hyperoxaluria in chronic liver disease and BMN 331, a gene therapy product candidate for Hereditary Angioedema (HAE). Please see the disclosures below in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these recent developments.

(6)    Marketed by Sanofi
VIMIZIM
VIMIZIM is an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of MPS IVA, a lysosomal storage disorder. MPS IVA is a disease characterized by deficient activity of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) causing excessive lysosomal storage of certain complex carbohydrates known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. This excessive storage causes a systemic skeletal dysplasia, short stature, and joint abnormalities, which limit mobility and endurance. 
Malformation of the chest impairs respiratory function, and looseness of joints in the neck cause spinal instability and potentially spinal cord compression. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, corneal clouding, and heart disease. Initial symptoms often become evident in the first five years of life. The disease substantially limits both the quality and length of life of those affected. 
VIMIZIM is approved for marketing in the U.S., the EU and other international markets.
NAGLAZYME
NAGLAZYME is a recombinant form of N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B) indicated for patients with MPS VI. MPS VI is a debilitating life-threatening genetic disease for which no other drug treatment currently exists and is caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase B, an enzyme normally required for the breakdown of GAGs. Patients with MPS VI typically become progressively worse and experience multiple severe and debilitating symptoms resulting from the build-up of carbohydrate residues in tissues in the body. These symptoms include: inhibited growth, spinal cord compression, enlarged liver and spleen, joint deformities and reduced range of motion, skeletal deformities, impaired cardiovascular function, upper airway obstruction, reduced pulmonary function, frequent ear and lung infections, impaired hearing and vision, sleep apnea, malaise and reduced endurance.
NAGLAZYME is approved for marketing in the U.S., the EU and other international markets.
PALYNZIQ
PALYNZIQ is a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine (Phe) ammonia lyase enzyme, which is delivered through subcutaneous injection to reduce blood Phe concentrations. PALYNZIQ is our second approved treatment for PKU. PALYNZIQ is approved for marketing in the U.S. for adult patients with PKU who have uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 micromol/L on existing management. PALYNZIQ is also approved for marketing in the EU and Australia for patients ages 16 and older who have inadequate blood Phe control (blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 micromol/L) despite prior management with available treatment options.
In the U.S., PALYNZIQ is only available through the PALYNZIQ Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program, which is required by the FDA to mitigate the risk of anaphylaxis while using the product. Notable requirements of our REMS program include the following:
•prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the REMS program and completing training;
•prescribers must prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine with PALYNZIQ;
•pharmacies must be certified with the REMS program and must dispense PALYNZIQ only to patients who are authorized to receive it;
•patients must enroll in the REMS program and be educated about the risk of anaphylaxis by a certified prescriber to ensure they understand the risks and benefits of treatment with PALYNZIQ; and
•patients must have auto-injectable epinephrine available at all times while taking PALYNZIQ.
Please see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks posed by the REMS program.
KUVAN
KUVAN is a proprietary synthetic oral form of 6R-BH4, a naturally occurring enzyme co-factor for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), indicated for patients with PKU. KUVAN is the first drug for the treatment of PKU, which is an inherited metabolic disease that affects at least 50,000 diagnosed patients under the age of 40 in the developed world. We believe that approximately 30% to 50% of those with PKU could benefit from treatment with KUVAN. PKU is caused by a deficiency of activity of an enzyme, PAH, which is required for the metabolism of Phe. Phe is an essential amino acid found in all protein-containing foods. Without sufficient quantity or activity of PAH, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood, resulting in a variety of serious neurological complications, including severe mental retardation and brain damage, mental illness, seizures and other cognitive problems. As a result of newborn screening efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all PKU patients under the age of 40 in developed countries have been diagnosed at birth. Currently, PKU can be managed by a Phe-restricted diet, which is supplemented by nutritional replacement products, like formulas and specially manufactured foods; however, it is difficult for most patients to adhere to the strict diet to the extent needed for achieving adequate control of blood Phe levels.
KUVAN is approved for marketing in the U.S., the EU and other international markets (excluding Japan). In certain international markets, KUVAN is also approved for, or is only approved for, the treatment of primary BH4 deficiency, a different disorder than PKU.
Generic versions of KUVAN are available in several countries around the world, including multiple generic versions in the U.S. We are also aware that manufacturers are challenging our patent portfolio related to KUVAN in several jurisdictions, and several generic versions of KUVAN have been approved either centrally by the EMA or on a country-by-country basis throughout the EU. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks posed by generic versions of KUVAN in the U.S. and international markets.
VOXZOGO
VOXZOGO is a once daily injection analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) for the treatment of achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans. In patients with achondroplasia, endochondral bone growth, an essential process by which bone tissue is created, is negatively regulated due to a gain of function mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3). VOXZOGO acts as a positive regulator of the signaling pathway downstream of FGFR3 to promote endochondral bone growth.
VOXZOGO is approved for marketing in the EU, Australia and Brazil for patients with achondroplasia ages two and older with open growth plates and in Japan for children with achondroplasia of all ages with open growth plates. The FDA granted accelerated approval for the use of VOXZOGO in the U.S. for patients with achondroplasia ages five and older with open growth plates. The FDA issued us a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) in connection with VOXZOGO’s accelerated approval, which confers priority review to a subsequent drug application that would not otherwise qualify for priority review. The PRV program is designed to encourage development of new drugs and biologics for the treatment of rare pediatric diseases. In the first quarter of 2022, we sold the PRV we obtained in connection with VOXZOGO’s accelerated approval for a gross lump sum payment of $110.0 million. 
We continue to research VOXZOGO’s safety and effectiveness in children with achondroplasia. On February 23, 2022, we announced results from our Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of VOXZOGO in infants and young children up to five years of age with achondroplasia, and on June 13, 2022, we announced additional details from the analysis. Results at 52 weeks trended in favor of VOXZOGO compared to placebo on height (adjusted for age and gender) and annualized growth velocity, consistent with improvements previously observed after one year of treatment in children over five years of age and without significantly impacting upper-to-lower body segment ratio. The safety profile was generally consistent with older children from the Phase 3 study and product label population. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were higher in the placebo group (18%) compared to children treated with VOXZOGO (7%). All SAEs, including a fatal respiratory arrest (reported as a sudden infant death syndrome in a treated infant with pre-existing respiratory morbidity), were deemed by the study investigators to be unrelated to treatment. The most common adverse events were mild and self-limiting injection site reactions. As part of our efforts to expand access to VOXZOGO for younger children, on January 3, 2023, we announced that we submitted, and the EMA subsequently validated, our Type II Variation application to extend the indication for VOXZOGO in the EU to treat children with achondroplasia under the age of 2. We also announced that we submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA to treat children with achondroplasia under the age of 5. Additionally, on August 3, 2022, we announced our interventional Phase 2 study with VOXZOGO for the treatment of infants under the age of two who are at risk for foramen magnum compression completed enrollment. The study is investigating the safety of VOXZOGO in infants at risk of requiring surgery to alleviate compression at the foramen magnum, the opening in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord passes. 
Moreover, we are evaluating VOXZOGO as a potential treatment for children with other genetic short stature conditions beyond achondroplasia. A 52-week investigator-initiated study sponsored by Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C. to investigate VOXZOGO in children with selected genetic forms of short stature is ongoing and expected to complete in 2023. Preliminary 6-month results from 12 subjects demonstrated a positive response in all subgroups with interindividual variability. 
BRINEURA
BRINEURA is a recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) for the treatment of patients with CLN2, a form of Batten disease. CLN2 is an incurable, rapidly progressive disease that typically ends in patient death by 10-12 years of age. Patients are initially healthy but begin to decline at approximately the age of three. We estimate that up to 1,200 to 1,600 cases exist worldwide. BRINEURA is the first treatment approved to slow the progression of loss of ambulation in children with CLN2 disease and was one of the first therapies to go through an accelerated review procedure in the EU.
BRINEURA is administered via intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion and intended to be used in combination with a delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. Please see “Government Regulation – Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion – Combination Products” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on combination products.
BRINEURA is approved for marketing in the U.S. (for ages three and older) and in the EU (for all ages from birth) and in other international markets.
ROCTAVIAN 
ROCTAVIAN is an adeno associated virus (AAV5) vector gene therapy designed to restore factor VIII plasma concentrations in patients with severe hemophilia A. Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII, a clotting protein. According to the World Federation of Hemophilia rankings of severity of hemophilia A, the normal range of factor VIII activity levels is between 50% and 150%, expressed as a percentage of normal factor activity in blood, the mild hemophilia A range of factor VIII activity levels is between 5% and 40%, the moderate hemophilia A range of factor VIII activity levels is between 1% and 5%, and the severe hemophilia range of factor VIII activity levels is less than 1%. People living with hemophilia A are not able to form blood clots efficiently and are at risk for excessive bleeding from modest injuries, potentially endangering their lives. People with severe hemophilia often bleed spontaneously into their muscles or joints. 
Our European launch of ROCTAVIAN is underway following ROCTAVIAN'S conditional approval for marketing in the EU in August 2022 for the treatment of severe hemophilia A in adult patients without a history of factor VIII inhibitors and without detectable antibodies to AAV5. We plan to provide the EMA further clinical data to convert our conditional approval to a standard marketing authorization. Please see “Government Regulation – Adaptive Pathways” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on conditional marketing authorizations. Moreover, we completed outcomes-based agreements (OBAs) for ROCTAVIAN with third-party payers in Germany, which make us subject to potential repayments if a patient does not respond to therapy or the therapeutic effect of the drug falls below specified thresholds. We continue to collaborate with other payers to secure additional OBAs for ROCTAVIAN, which are intended to assist payers with realizing the value and sharing the risk of a one-time treatment.
On October 12, 2022, we announced that the FDA accepted for review our resubmission of the BLA for ROCTAVIAN for the treatment of adults with severe hemophilia A. The BLA resubmission incorporates our responses to all deficiencies identified in the FDA’s August 2020 Complete Response Letter to our original BLA submission. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date for the resubmitted BLA is March 31, 2023. Typically, BLA resubmissions are followed by a six-month review procedure. However, three additional months of review may be necessary in connection with our recent submission to the FDA of data from our three-year analysis of the global Phase 3 study of ROCTAVIAN, as discussed below. Additionally, the FDA completed a Pre-License Inspection of the ROCTAVIAN manufacturing facility in early December 2022. We have provided responses to the FDA’s comments and observations received at the close of the inspection, and we believe all are addressable.
On May 31, 2022, we announced an update to our previously reported results of an open-label Phase 1/2 study of ROCTAVIAN for the treatment of adults with severe hemophilia A. The six-year update for the 6e13 vg/kg and five-year update for the 4e13 vg/kg cohorts showed a sustained treatment benefit of ROCTAVIAN. All participants, except one in the 4e13 vg/kg cohort as discussed below, had remained off prophylactic factor VIII treatment since receiving their single dose of ROCTAVIAN. Six months prior to the data cut, one participant in the 4e13 vg/kg cohort temporarily resumed prophylactic factor VIII treatment for one month, after which he was bleed free through the last follow up. In addition, the mean annualized bleed rates (ABR) for the most recent year were less than one in both cohorts and below pre-treatment baseline levels.
On January 8, 2023, we announced topline results from our three-year analysis of the global Phase 3 study of ROCTAVIAN for the treatment of adults with severe hemophilia A. All 132 study participants received a single dose of ROCTAVIAN and had a minimum of 36 months of follow-up. For a pre-specified group of 112 participants (two of whom discontinued from the study prior to reaching three years of follow-up) in a non-interventional prospective baseline observational study after dosing with ROCTAVIAN (the Rollover Population), in year three the mean ABR was reduced by 80% from baseline, with a mean ABR for treated bleeds of 1.0 (median 0.0). For the Rollover Population, in year three the mean annualized factor VIII infusion rate was reduced by 94% from baseline, with a mean annualized infusion rate of 8.4 (median 0.0). As of the three-year data cut, 92% of the Rollover Population participants remained off factor VIII prophylactic therapy. At the end of the three year post-infusion with ROCTAVIAN, the population of 132 participants had a mean factor VIII activity level of 18.8 (median 8.4) IU/dL, as measured by the chromogenic substrate (CS) assay. In the 17 participants (one of whom discontinued from the study prior to reaching four years of follow-up) who had been dosed at least four years prior to the data cut, mean factor VIII activity was 15.2 (median 7.4) IU/dL by the CS assay at the end of year three. The mean ABR for treated bleeds in year four for this subpopulation was 0.8 (median 0.0) and the mean annualized infusion rate was 11.1 (median 0.0).
In addition to the ongoing Phase 1/2 and Phase 3 studies of ROCTAVIAN described above, we have multiple other clinical studies of ROCTAVIAN underway. We are conducting an ongoing Phase 3, single arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ROCTAVIAN at a dose of 6e13 vg/kg with prophylactic corticosteroids in people with severe hemophilia A. We are also conducting an ongoing Phase 1/2 Study with the 6e13 vg/kg dose of ROCTAVIAN in people with severe hemophilia A with pre-existing AAV5 antibodies and a Phase 1/2 Study with the 6e13 vg/kg dose of ROCTAVIAN in people with severe hemophilia A with active or prior factor VIII inhibitors.
Overall, ROCTAVIAN continues to have a favorable safety profile and has been generally well tolerated by participants across all doses in the Phase 1/2 and Phase 3 studies. No participants developed inhibitors to factor VIII, malignancy, or thromboembolic events. The most common adverse events associated with ROCTAVIAN across studies occurred early and included transient infusion-associated reactions and mild to moderate rise in liver enzymes with no long-lasting clinical sequelae. 
During year three of the Phase 3 study, no new treatment-related SAEs or Grade 3 events attributed to ROCTAVIAN or corticosteroid use emerged.
ALDURAZYME
ALDURAZYME is a highly purified protein that is designed to be identical to a naturally occurring form of the human enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, a lysosomal enzyme normally required for the breakdown of GAGs. MPS I is a progressive and debilitating life-threatening genetic disease, for which no other drug treatment currently exists, that is caused by the deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase. Patients with MPS I typically become progressively worse and experience multiple severe and debilitating symptoms resulting from the build-up of carbohydrate residues in all tissues in the body. These symptoms include: inhibited growth, delayed and regressed mental development (in the severe form of the disease), enlarged liver and spleen, joint deformities and reduced range of motion, impaired cardiovascular function, upper airway obstruction, reduced pulmonary function, frequent ear and lung infections, impaired hearing and vision, sleep apnea, malaise and reduced endurance.
We developed ALDURAZYME through collaboration with Sanofi. Under our collaboration agreement with Sanofi, we are responsible for manufacturing ALDURAZYME and supplying it to Sanofi. We receive payments ranging from 39.5% to 50% on worldwide net ALDURAZYME sales by Sanofi depending on sales volume. Sanofi and BioMarin are members of BioMarin/Genzyme LLC, a 50/50 limited liability company (the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC) that: (1) holds the intellectual property relating to ALDURAZYME and other collaboration products and licenses all such intellectual property on a royalty-free basis to Sanofi and BioMarin to allow us to exercise our rights and perform our obligations under the agreements related to the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC, and (2) engages in research and development activities that are mutually selected and funded by Sanofi and us.
ALDURAZYME is approved for marketing in the U.S., the EU and other international markets. 
Clinical Development Programs
A summary of our clinical development programs is provided below:

Clinical Development Programs | TargetIndication | Stage 
ROCTAVIAN | Severe Hemophilia A | FDA regulatory review
BMN 255 | Hyperoxaluria | Clinical Phase 1/2 
BMN 331 | Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) | Clinical Phase 1/2 

BMN 255
BMN 255 is a small-molecule therapy that is designed to treat hyperoxaluria in chronic liver disease. We concluded the multiple-ascending dose phase of the first-in-human study with BMN 255. In January 2023, we shared early data that demonstrated a rapid and potent increase in plasma glycolate following treatment with BMN 255, which is predicted to have a profound reduction in oxalate excretion in patients. We plan to initiate and fully enroll an expanded study in patients with chronic liver disease and hyperoxaluria in 2023. We believe the availability of a potent, orally bioavailable, small molecule like BMN 255 may be able to significantly reduce disease and treatment burden in a patient population with significant unmet need.
BMN 331
BMN 331 is a gene therapy product candidate for HAE. Dosing continues in the Phase 1/2 HAERMONY study to evaluate BMN 331, an investigational AAV5-mediated gene therapy for people living with HAE, including dose escalation to the 6e13vg/kg dose, which our non-clinical studies project to provide therapeutic levels of C1-Inhibitor. In January 2023, we shared that the first participant treated with the 6e13vg/kg dose of BMN 331 demonstrated C1-Inhibitor levels that were approaching the normal range. A second participant is scheduled for dosing at the 6e13vg/kg dose level in the near term.
Manufacturing
We manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) for ALDURAZYME, NAGLAZYME, PALYNZIQ and VOXZOGO in our production facilities located in Novato, California. We manufacture the API for BRINEURA and VIMIZIM in our manufacturing facility in Shanbally, Cork, Ireland. These facilities have been inspected and have demonstrated compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EC and health agencies in other countries.
We contract with third parties to manufacture KUVAN API. All our product manufacturing (which includes vials, syringes, tablets, and powder) and most packaging operations are performed by contract manufacturers. We expect to continue to contract with outside service providers for certain manufacturing services, including drug substance, drug product, and packaging operations for our products. All of our facilities and those of any third-party manufacturers will be subject to periodic inspections 
confirming compliance with applicable law and must pass inspection before we can manufacture our drugs for commercial sales. Third-party manufacturers’ facilities are subject to periodic inspections to confirm compliance with applicable law and must be cGMP certified. We believe that our current agreements with third-party manufacturers and suppliers provide for ample operating capacity to support the anticipated clinical and commercial demand for these products. In certain instances, there is only one approved contract manufacturer for certain aspects of the manufacturing process. In such cases, we attempt to prevent disruption of supplies through supply agreements, maintaining safety stock and other appropriate strategies.
In July 2017, we commissioned our commercial-scale gene therapy manufacturing facility, located in Novato, California, where we conduct cGMP production of ROCTAVIAN to support commercial sales in Europe, anticipated commercial demand in other markets and clinical development activities. The facility has been inspected and has demonstrated compliance with cGMPs to the satisfaction of the EC. This facility also supports cGMP production of BMN 331 to support clinical development activities. This facility has the potential to produce multiple gene therapy products to meet global commercial demand, depending on dose and production mix. The facility holds a GMP certificate and its production processes have been developed in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use facilitating worldwide registration with health authorities. 
Raw Materials
Raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products and product candidates are available in some instances from one supplier and in other instances from multiple suppliers. In those cases where raw materials are only available through one supplier, such supplier may be either a sole source (the only recognized supply source available to us) or a single source (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We have adopted policies to attempt, to the extent feasible, to minimize our raw material supply risks, including maintenance of greater levels of raw materials inventory and implementation of multiple raw materials sourcing strategies, especially for critical raw materials. Although to date we have not experienced any significant delays in obtaining any raw materials from our suppliers, we cannot provide assurance that we will not face shortages from one or more of them in the future.
Sales and Marketing
We have established a commercial organization, including a sales force, to support our product lines directly in the U.S., Europe, South America and certain other significant markets. For other selected markets, we have signed agreements with other companies to act as distributors of all our products, other than ALDURAZYME. Most of these agreements generally grant the distributor the right to market the product in the territory and the obligation to secure all necessary regulatory approvals for commercial or named patient sales. Additional markets are being assessed at this time and additional agreements may be signed in the future.
Sanofi has the exclusive right to distribute, market and sell ALDURAZYME globally and is required to purchase its requirements exclusively from us.
In the U.S., our products (other than ALDURAZYME) are marketed through our commercial teams, including sales representatives and supporting staff members, who promote our products directly to physicians in specialties appropriate for each product. Outside of the U.S., our sales representatives and supporting staff members market our products (other than ALDURAZYME). We believe that with moderate changes in 2023, the size of our sales force will be appropriate to effectively reach our target customers in markets where our products are directly marketed. The launch of any future products, if approved, will likely require expansion of our commercial organization, including our sales force, in the U.S. and international markets.
We utilize third-party logistics companies to store and distribute our products. Moreover, we use third-party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support-related services, to assist with our commercial activities. 
Customers
Customers for our products (other than ALDURAZYME) include a limited number of specialty pharmacies and end-users, such as hospitals and non-U.S. government agencies. We also sell our products (other than ALDURAZYME) to our authorized distributors and to certain larger pharmaceutical wholesalers globally, which act as intermediaries between us and end-users and generally do not stock significant quantities of our products. However, in certain countries, governments place large periodic orders for NAGLAZYME and VIMIZIM. The timing of these orders can be inconsistent and can create significant quarter to quarter variation in our revenue. PALYNZIQ is currently distributed in the U.S. pursuant to the REMS program through a limited number of 
certified specialty pharmacies. During 2022, 37% of our net product revenue was generated by three customers. Sanofi is our sole customer for ALDURAZYME and is responsible for marketing and selling ALDURAZYME to third parties.
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Within the industry, there are many public and private companies, including pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that have or may soon initiate programs for the same indications that our products and product candidates are intended to treat. Furthermore, universities and non-profit research organizations may have research programs, both early-stage and clinical, in the same disease areas. Our larger competitors may have advantages over us due to greater financial or scientific resources, lower labor and other costs, or higher headcount and more robust organizational structures, while smaller competitors may have advantages over us due to lower overhead costs, being more nimble, or being able to focus on a narrower set of indications or development programs. Our competitors have considerable experience in drug manufacturing, preclinical and clinical research and development, regulatory affairs, marketing, sales, and distribution. They pursue broad patent portfolios and other intellectual property to protect the products they are developing. Their products may outcompete ours due to one or more factors, including faster progress through preclinical and clinical development, lower manufacturing costs, superior safety and efficacy, lower pricing, stronger patent protection, and better marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities. In this event, our products and product candidates, if approved, could fail to gain significant market share, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Other than ROCTAVIAN and KUVAN, as described below, our products have no direct approved competition currently on the market in the U.S. or the EU; however, other companies are in the development phase with new and generic products. Our products and product candidates have potential competition from products under development either using similar technology to our programs or different treatment strategies. The following is a summary of some of the primary possible future competitors for our products and product candidates, but the information below may not include all potential competition. 
Commercial Products
ALDURAZYME, NAGLAZYME, and VIMIZIM
In the mucopolysaccharidosis field, several companies are researching treatments using small molecules, gene therapy, and other novel technologies. ALDURAZYME, for the treatment of MPS I, has potential competition from clinical stage product candidates from ArmaGen, Inc., JCR Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd (acquired by ArmaGen, Inc.)., Orchard Therapeutics Plc and RegenxBio Inc. and earlier stage product candidates, including product candidates from Denali Therapeutics Inc. and Immusoft Corporation. NAGLAZYME, for the treatment of MPS VI, has potential competition from clinical stage product candidates from Inventiva S.A. and Paradigm Biopharmaceuticals Limited and other potential candidates in earlier stages. VIMIZIM, for the treatment of MPS IVA, has potential competition from preclinical product candidates from Esteve Pharmaceuticals, S.A., and RegenxBio Inc. and other potential candidates in earlier stages.
BRINEURA
BRINEURA, for the treatment of CLN2, has potential competition from preclinical product candidates from Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc., RegenxBio Inc. and the Roche Group.
KUVAN and PALYNZIQ
There are currently no other approved, non-generic drugs on the market in the U.S. or the EU for the treatment of PKU. However, generic versions of KUVAN are available in several countries around the world, including multiple generic versions in the U.S. We are also aware that manufacturers are challenging our patent portfolio related to KUVAN in several jurisdictions, and several generic versions of KUVAN have been approved either centrally by the EMA or on a country-by-country basis throughout the EU. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks posed by generic versions of KUVAN in the U.S. and international markets. KUVAN and PALYNZIQ also have potential competition from clinical stage product candidates from Homology Medicines, Inc., Jnana Therapeutics Inc., Nestle Health Science, S.A., PTC Therapeutics, Inc. and Synlogic, Inc. and earlier stage product candidates, including product candidates from Codexis, Inc, Generation Bio Co., LogicBio Therapeutics, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. and SOM Innovation Biotech, S.A. We and other companies are also developing gene therapy product candidates for PKU.
VOXZOGO
VOXZOGO, for the treatment of achondroplasia, could have competition from clinical stage products under development by Ascendis Pharma A/S, Pfizer, Inc., QED Therapeutics, Inc.

Patents, Proprietary Rights and Regulatory Exclusivity
Our success depends on an intellectual property portfolio that supports our future revenue streams and also erects barriers to our competitors. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through: filing new patent applications; prosecuting existing applications; and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications. Furthermore we seek to protect our ownership of know-how, trade secrets and trademarks through an active program of legal mechanisms including registrations, assignments, confidentiality agreements, material transfer agreements, research collaborations and licenses.
U.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest application was filed. U.S. patents that were issued on applications filed before June 8, 1995, may be effective until 17 years from the issue date, if that is later than the 20-year date. In some cases, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review of the claimed therapeutic or, in the case of the U.S., because of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) delays in prosecuting the application. In the U.S., under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act), a patent that covers a drug approved by the FDA may be eligible for patent term extension (for up to five years, but not beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The duration and extension of the term of foreign patents varies in accordance with local law. In the EU, Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs, are available to extend a patent term up to five years to compensate for patent protection lost during regulatory review. Although all EU Member States must provide SPCs, SPCs must be applied for and granted on a country-by-country basis. Limited exceptions apply to the protection conferred by the SPC.

With respect to our clinical product candidates, we believe we have the necessary intellectual property rights to allow us to undertake the development of these candidates. Certain of our product candidates are in therapeutic areas that have been the subject of many years of extensive research and development by academic organizations and third parties who may control patents or other intellectual property that they might assert against us, should one or more of our product candidates in these therapeutic areas succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and thereafter be commercialized. We continually evaluate the intellectual property rights of others in these areas in order to determine whether a claim of infringement may be made by others against us. Should we determine that a third party has intellectual property rights that could impact our ability to freely market a compound we consider a number of factors in determining how best to prepare for the commercialization of any such product candidate. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the stage of development of our product candidate and whether we and our outside counsel believe the intellectual property rights of others are valid, whether we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, whether a license is available upon commercially reasonable terms, whether we will seek to challenge the intellectual property rights of others, and the likelihood of and liability resulting from an adverse outcome should we be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others.
Government Regulation
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S., European countries and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, commercialization, pricing and reimbursement of our products. Our industry is subject to significant federal, state, local and non-U.S. regulation. Our products require approval from the FDA, the EC (on the basis of the scientific opinions issued by the EMA) and corresponding agencies in other countries before they can be marketed. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. and foreign requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension or withdrawal of marketing, production or distribution authorizations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Approval Process in the U.S. and EU
Satisfaction of FDA and EU pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. and the EU typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the applicable regulatory agency of an application (e.g., an IND in the U.S. or a CTA in the EU), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which marketing approval is sought. On January 31, 2022, Regulation EU No 536/2014 (CTR) became fully applicable in the EU. The CTR established a centralized application procedure where one of the National Competent Authorities 
(NCA) of the Member States where the trial will take place takes the lead in reviewing certain aspects of the application, while the other NCAs have a lesser involvement than they had under the previous regime established by Directive 2001/20/EC (CTD). The CTD indeed introduced the first set of harmonized rules on clinical trials in the EU but resulted in a patchwork of different national regimes. The CTR was adopted with a view to introducing a more uniform set of the rules across the EU for the authorization of clinical trials. Such authorization still involves the national regulatory authorities and Ethics Committees of each of the EU Member States where the trial is to be conducted. However, the relevant procedures have now been streamlined with a view to facilitating a swifter and more seamless authorization and deployment of multi-center trials occurring in more than one EU Member State. More specifically, the CTR allows sponsors to rely on one single submission for CTAs regardless of the number of Member States where the trial takes place and based on a single harmonized application. Furthermore, under the CTR, deadlines for regulatory approvals are shortened with a view to accelerating the authorization process. The CTR also established an EU Portal which will act as a single-entry point for submission of data and information relating to clinical trials. Until January 30, 2025, the CTD will continue to apply in parallel to the CTR for a transitional period. From January 31, 2025 all trials will have to comply with the CTR.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation, as well as animal studies, to assess the characteristics and potential pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with FDA and/or EU and national regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices (GLP). The results of preclinical testing, along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol are reviewed by the applicable regulatory agency as part of an IND or CTA. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND or CTA is submitted. Until the CTA or IND is approved, or becomes effective following a waiting period, and appropriate reviews have been satisfactorily completed by the applicable Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) or Ethics Committees, we may not start the clinical trial in the relevant jurisdiction.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with applicable regulations, good clinical practices (GCP), as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial and the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and to the relevant regulatory agency in the EU as part of a new CTA.
The regulatory agencies may order the temporary halt or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if they believe that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB/Ethics Committee may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB/Ethics Committee’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials that are deployed to support NDAs, BLAs or Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Typically, we undertake a three-phase human clinical testing program as follows:
•Phase 1 - the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness.
•Phase 2 - usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations.
•Phase 3 - undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an application is prepared and submitted to the applicable regulatory agency. Approval of the application by the applicable regulatory agency is required before marketing of the product may begin. In the European Economic Area (i.e., the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (the EEA), there are two types of marketing authorizations (MA), namely: (i) the “Union” MA, which is issued by the EC through the so-called “centralized procedure”, based on the positive opinion of the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), and results in a single marketing authorization that is valid across the EEA; and (ii) “National MAs,” which are issued by the competent NCAs and only cover their respective territory. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products such as: (i) medicinal products derived from certain biotechnology processes, (ii) designated orphan medicinal products, (iii) medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other auto-immune dysfunctions, viral diseases; and (iv) Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines). The NDA, BLA or MAA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing, a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls and proposed labeling, among other things. In the U.S., each NDA or BLA is subject to a significant user fee at the time of submission, unless a waiver is granted by the FDA. Similarly, in the EU, the submission of an MAA is subject to the payment of fees, a waiver of which may be obtained only under limited circumstances. The FDA and the EMA initially review the applications for a threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The regulatory agency 
may request additional information rather than accepting an application for filing or validation. Once the submission is accepted, the applicable agency begins an in-depth review. For the FDA, the review period for standard review applications is typically an additional ten months and, for priority review of drugs, that is, drugs that the FDA determines address a significant unmet need and represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, the review period is typically an additional six months in duration. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information submitted during the review or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. After the FDA evaluates the information provided in the NDA/BLA, it issues an approval letter, or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed and the NDA/BLA has been resubmitted, the FDA will re-initiate review. If it is satisfied that the deficiencies have been addressed, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes so-called clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the EC. If the opinion is favorable, the EC may then adopt a decision to grant marketing authorization. In the event of a negative opinion, the company may request a re-examination of the application within 15 days of receipt of the negative opinion. The company then has 60 days to provide the CHMP with detailed grounds for requesting the re-examination. Within 60 days of providing this information, the CHMP must re-examine its opinion. The EC follows the recommendation of the CHMP in almost all cases. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of an MAA in no more than 150 days. This is usually when the product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation.
During the review period, the FDA and/or the European authorities may typically inspect one or more clinical sites and/or the sponsor to assure compliance with GCP regulations and may equally inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured to ensure compliance with cGMPs regulations. Neither the FDA nor the EC will approve the product unless compliance is satisfactory and the application contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the FDA’s fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Under the fast track program and the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of a Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trial to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct a required post-approval study or confirm a clinical benefit through a post-marketing study will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA) was recently enacted, which included provisions related to the accelerated approval pathway. Pursuant to FDORA, the FDA is authorized to require a post-approval study to be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period following approval. FDORA also requires the FDA to specify conditions of any required post-approval study, which may include milestones such as a target date of study completion and requires sponsors to submit progress reports for required post-approval studies and any conditions required by the FDA not later than 180 days following approval and not less frequently than every 180 days thereafter until completion or 
termination of the study. FDORA enables the FDA to initiate criminal prosecutions for the failure to conduct with due diligence a required post-approval study, including a failure to meet any required conditions specified by the FDA or to submit timely reports.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Adaptive Pathways
The EMA has an adaptive pathways approach which allows for early and progressive patient access to a medicine in cases of high medical need. To achieve this goal, several approaches are envisaged including for example identifying small populations with severe disease where a medicine’s benefit-risk balance could be favorable or making more use of real-world data where appropriate to support clinical trial data. The adaptive pathways concept applies primarily to treatments in areas of high medical need where it is difficult to collect data via traditional routes and where large clinical trials would unnecessarily expose patients who are unlikely to benefit from the medicine. The approach builds on regulatory processes already in place within the existing EU legal framework. These include: scientific advice; compassionate use; the conditional MA; patient registries and other pharmacovigilance tools that allow collection of real-life data and development of a risk-management plan for each medicine.
A conditional MA may be granted prior to the submission of comprehensive clinical data if the benefit of the immediate availability on the market of the product is deemed to outweigh the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. In emergency situations, a MA for such medicinal products may be granted also where comprehensive pre-clinical or pharmaceutical data have not been provided. Under this procedure a MA can be granted as soon as sufficient data becomes available to demonstrate that the drug's benefits outweigh its risks, with safeguards and controls in place post-authorization. This procedure can also be combined with a rolling review of data during the development of a promising medicine, to further expedite its evaluation. Conditional MAs are typically subject to obligations that are reviewed annually. These include the obligation to complete ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, with a view to confirming that the risk-benefit balance is favorable. Conditional MAs are valid for one year and are renewable.
PRIME Program
The EMA launched its PRIME regulatory program to enhance support for the development of therapies that target an unmet medical need. The initiative focuses on drugs that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients with no treatment options. These therapies are considered priority medicines within the EU. Through PRIME, the EMA offers early, proactive and enhanced support to drug developers to optimize the generation of robust data on a therapy’s benefits and risks and enable accelerated assessment of drug applications.
Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion
A marketing approval authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Similar rules apply outside of the U.S. For example, products approved in the EU may be subject to post-authorization requirements such as the obligation to perform post-authorization efficacy studies (PAES) or post-authorization safety studies (PASS) imposed as conditions to the MA, or other Risk Minimization Measures (RMMs), such as educational programs or controlled access programs, which may sometimes vary from one EU Member State to another. 
Regulation of Manufacturing Standards
The FDA as well as other regulatory agencies around the world, regulate and inspect the equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to granting approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA and other agencies such as the EC we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. We also must adhere to cGMP regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies through their facilities inspection program. The FDA and 
other regulatory agencies around the world conduct regular, periodic visits to reinspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval.
Combination Products
Combination products are defined by the FDA as products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. For example, in the EU, if a device intended to administer a medicinal product is sold together with such medicinal product in such a way that they form a single integral product which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable, that single integral product is regulated as a medicinal product. In addition, the relevant general safety and performance requirements established for medical devices by EU medical devices legislation apply to the device component of such combination products. A number of our products qualify as combination products and are regulated under the applicable framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under such framework as well.
Post-Approval Regulatory Requirements
Following approval, the FDA and the regulatory authorities around the world will impose certain post-approval requirements related to a product. For instance, the FDA and European authorities closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of approved products, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising (which is prohibited in the EU for prescription products such as our products), off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Moreover, if a company obtains original approval for a product via an accelerated approval pathway, the company will be typically required to conduct a post-marketing confirmatory trial to verify and describe the clinical benefit in support of full approval. An unsuccessful post-marketing study or failure to complete such a study could result in the withdrawal of the marketing approval for a product.
Approved products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a submission to and approval by the FDA or the EC, as applicable, before the change can be implemented. An NDA/BLA or MAA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and similar procedures and actions in reviewing NDA/ BLA or MAA supplements as in reviewing NDAs/BLAs and MAAs.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following marketing approval. Either the FDA or the EC/EMA may also require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as the manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug and biological product manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, the EMA/NCAs, during which the inspectors audit manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, prescription drug manufacturers in the U.S. must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate products. Similarly, in the EU, stringent rules have been introduced to fight medicine falsifications and to ensure that the trade in medicines is subject to rigorous controls. Measures required to ensure that include: a unique identifier and an anti-tampering device on the outer packaging of drugs, stringent rules on import of active pharmaceutical ingredients and record-keeping requirements for wholesale distributors.
Approval Regulation Outside of the U.S. and the EU
For marketing outside the U.S. and the EU, we are subject to non-U.S. regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for our products. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, can differ from those in the U.S. and the EU and may require us to perform additional preclinical or clinical testing. The amount of time required to obtain necessary approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or EC approval. In many countries outside of the U.S., approvals for pricing, coverage and reimbursement offered by third-party payers, including government payers and private insurance plans, are also required.
Other Regulation
Exclusivity for Biologics in the U.S.
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, the PPACA), created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-licensed product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical study, absent a waiver from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In order to meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. The first biosimilar product was approved under the BPCIA in 2015, and the first interchangeable product was approved in 2021. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) eighteen months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is not patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
Data Exclusivity and Market Exclusivity in the EU
The EU provides opportunities for market and data exclusivity for all products containing a New Active Substance, or NAS (such as a chemical, biological or radiopharmaceutical substance not previously authorized as a medicinal product in the EU), which have been granted an MA. These products receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial MA of the reference product in the EU. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Orphan Drug Designation
Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA and the EC to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which in the U.S. is defined as having a prevalence of less than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. In the EU, orphan drug designation is available if a sponsor can establish: that the medicine is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU, which is equivalent to around 250,000 people or fewer, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives derived from the orphan status, it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicinal product in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these criteria, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application and, in the EU, it must be maintained until the time of the granting of the MA. Orphan designation is indeed lost in the EU if it is established that the product no longer meets the orphan criteria at the time a MA is granted for such product.
Orphan drug designation does not shorten the regulatory review and approval process. However, if an orphan drug later receives approval for the indication for which it has designation, the relevant regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU (extendable to twelve years for medicines that have complied with an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) pursuant to Regulation 1901/2006) and, in addition, a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process are available in the EU, including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. Among the benefits of orphan drug designation in the U.S. are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA/BLA 
application user fee. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost under certain conditions, such as if the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug. In the EU, a MA may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the regulatory exclusivity period with the consent of the MA holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the MA holder of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. A MA may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the second applicant can establish that its medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the criteria for its designation as an orphan medicine are no longer satisfied, for example if the original orphan medicinal product has become sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry, including legislation that seeks to directly or indirectly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors “Government healthcare reform could increase our costs and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.”
Other Regulatory Requirements
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims, patient data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The PPACA amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback and certain other criminal healthcare fraud statutes such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. The PPACA amended the statute so that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims laws. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn are used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, certain types of advanced practice nurses and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. 
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states while other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities. Other states require submission or disclosure of certain pricing information. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, states including California, Connecticut, 
Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Currently, several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include significant penalties, including administrative and criminal sanctions, civil monetary penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, exclusion of a company from federal healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, criminal fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, curtailment of operations and imprisonment.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any non-U.S. government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Similar laws exist in other countries, such as the U.K., that restrict improper payments to public and private parties. Many countries have laws prohibiting these types of payments within the respective country. In the EU, for example, harmonized rules prohibit gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind to Health Care Professionals (HCPs) unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. Similarly, strict rules apply to hospitality at sales promotion events. Based on these rules, a body of industry guidelines and sometimes national laws in force in individual EU Member States has been introduced to fight improper payments or other transfers of value to HCPs, and in general inducements that may have a broadly promotional character. Historically, pharmaceutical companies have been the target of FCPA and other anti-corruption and similar investigations, as well as of wide media attention, sometimes resulting in significant penalties, image and other costs for such companies.
Pricing and Reimbursement
Because the course of treatment for patients using our products is expensive, sales of our products depend, in significant part, on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement offered by third-party payers, including government payers and private insurance plans. Governments may regulate access to, prices of or reimbursement levels for our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products, and private insurers may be influenced by government reimbursement methodologies.
Third-party payers carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for drugs, examine their medical necessity, and review their cost effectiveness. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the third-party payer, the insurance plan and other factors. One payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the product. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payer will pay for the product. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain high enough price levels to realize sufficient revenues from our investment in product development. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Outside of the U.S. our products are paid for by a variety of payers, with governments being the primary source of payment. Reimbursement in the EU and many other territories must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until pricing and/or reimbursement is approved. In many countries the government closely regulates drug pricing and reimbursement and often has a significant discretion in determining whether a product will be reimbursed at all and, if it is, how much will be paid. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization of our products. Payers in many countries use a variety of cost-containment measures that can include referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set their own price, mandatory price cuts and rebates. This international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices across countries and some cross-border trade in our products from markets with lower prices. Even after a price is negotiated, countries frequently request or require adjustments to the price and other concessions over time.
Government Pricing and Reimbursement Programs for Marketed Drugs in the U.S.
Medicaid, the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and Medicare
Federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having its products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for all units of its covered outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program under either a fee-for-service arrangement or through a managed care organization. This federal requirement is effectuated through a Medicaid drug rebate agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. CMS administers the Medicaid drug rebate agreements, which provide, among other things, that the drug manufacturer will pay rebates to each state Medicaid agency 
on a quarterly basis and report certain price information on a monthly and quarterly basis. The rebates are based on prices reported to CMS by manufacturers for their covered outpatient drugs. For non-innovator products, generally generic drugs marketed under abbreviated new drug applications (referred to as ANDAs), the rebate amount is 13% of the average manufacturer price (AMP) for the quarter. The AMP is the weighted average of prices paid to the manufacturer (1) directly by retail community pharmacies and (2) by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies. For innovator products (i.e., drugs that are marketed under NDAs or BLAs), the rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the AMP for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the best price for that same quarter. The best price is essentially the lowest price available to non-governmental entities. Innovator products may also be subject to an additional rebate that is based on the amount, if any, by which the product’s AMP for a given quarter exceeds the inflation-adjusted baseline AMP, which for most drugs is the AMP for the first full quarter after launch. Since 2017, non-innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate. To date, the rebate amount for a drug has been capped at 100% of the AMP; however, effective January 1, 2024, this cap will be eliminated, which means that a manufacturer could pay a rebate amount on a unit of the drug that is greater than the average price the manufacturer receives for the drug.
The terms of participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in additional or lesser rebate liability, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if a manufacturer were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
A manufacturer must also participate in a federal program known as the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available to pay for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under this program, the participating manufacturer agrees to charge certain safety net healthcare providers no more than an established discounted price for its covered outpatient drugs. The formula for determining the discounted price is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and the unit rebate amount as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above. Manufacturers are required to report pricing information to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) on a quarterly basis. HRSA has also issued regulations relating to the calculation of the ceiling price as well as imposition of civil monetary penalties for each instance of knowingly and intentionally overcharging a 340B covered entity.
Federal law also requires that manufacturers report data on a quarterly basis to CMS regarding the pricing of drugs that are separately reimbursable under Medicare Part B. These are generally drugs, such as injectable products, that are administered “incident to” a physician service and are not generally self-administered. The pricing information submitted by manufacturers is the basis for reimbursement to physicians and suppliers for drugs covered under Medicare Part B. As with the Medicaid drug rebate program, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
Medicare Part D provides prescription drug benefits for seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare Part D enrollees once had a gap in their coverage (between the initial coverage limit and the point at which catastrophic coverage begins) where Medicare did not cover their prescription drug costs, known as the coverage gap. However, beginning in 2019, Medicare Part D enrollees paid 25% of brand drug costs after they reached the initial coverage limit - the same percentage they were responsible for before they reached that limit - thereby closing the coverage gap from the enrollee’s point of view. Most of the cost of closing the coverage gap is being borne by innovator companies and the government through subsidies. Each manufacturer of drugs approved under NDAs or BLAs is required to enter into a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount agreement and provide a 70% discount on those drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D enrollees in the coverage gap, in order for its drugs to be reimbursed by Medicare Part D. Beginning in 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) eliminates the coverage gap under Medicare Part D by significantly lowering the enrollee maximum out-of-pocket cost and requiring manufacturers to subsidize, through a newly established manufacturer discount program, 10% of Part D enrollees’ prescription costs for brand drugs below the out-of-pocket maximum, and 20% once the out-of-pocket maximum has been reached. Although these discounts represent a lower percentage of enrollees’ costs than the current discounts required below the out-of-pocket maximum (that is, in the coverage gap phase of Part D coverage), the new manufacturer contribution required above the out-of-pocket maximum could be considerable for very high-cost patients and the total contributions by manufacturers to a Part D enrollee’s drug expenses may exceed those currently provided.
The IRA will also allow the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate the selling price of certain drugs and biologics that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D, although only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least 7 years (11 years for biologics) can be selected by CMS for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. The negotiated prices, which will first become effective in 2026, will be capped at a statutory ceiling price. Beginning in October 2022 for Medicare Part D and January 2023 for Medicare Part B, the IRA will also penalize drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part D and Part B drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation.
U.S. Federal Contracting and Pricing Requirements
Manufacturers are also required to make their covered drugs, which are generally drugs approved under NDAs or BLAs, available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) of the General Services Administration. The law also requires manufacturers to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases of their covered drugs by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement or purchase of the manufacturer’s drugs under certain federal programs. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies for covered drugs must be no more than the Federal Ceiling Price (FCP), which is at least 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP) for the prior year. The Non-FAMP is the average price for covered drugs sold to wholesalers or other middlemen, net of any price reductions.
The accuracy of a manufacturer’s reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs, or FSS contract prices may be audited by the government. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. If a manufacturer were found to have knowingly reported false prices, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the law provides for significant civil monetary penalties per incorrect item. Finally, manufacturers are required to disclose in FSS contract proposals all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than the proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, manufacturers are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. In certain circumstances, disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. In the EU there is an increasing trend requiring public disclosure of development data, in particular clinical trial data. These data were traditionally regarded as Confidential Commercial Information (CCI); however, under policies adopted in the EU, clinical study data submitted to the EMA in MAAs, including preclinical data, and patient level data, may be subject to public disclosure. This is confirmed in the CTR, the new EU legislation on clinical trials, according to which clinical trial applications and all the related documentation are uploaded and stored in the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) which is managed by the EMA. Confirming the transparency principle, the CTR provides that the information stored in such system is publicly accessible unless confidentiality is justified on the basis of a limited set of exceptions. These exceptions, which are to be interpreted narrowly in the EU, include the protection of CCI, in particular through taking into account the status of the MA for the applicable product; however, CCI is overridden in those cases where the authorities conclude that there is an overriding public interest in disclosure. Case law of the Court of Justice of the EU has also confirmed the absence of a general presumption of confidentiality over documents containing clinical and preclinical data provided to the EMA in support of a MAA.
Pediatric Indications
In the U.S., under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007 (PREA), NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indication(s) in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by statute or regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides sponsors of NDAs with an additional six-month period of market exclusivity for all unexpired patent or non-patent exclusivity on all forms of the drug containing the active moiety if the sponsor submits results of pediatric studies specifically requested by the FDA under BPCA within required timeframes. The BPCIA provides sponsors of BLAs an additional six-month extension for all unexpired non-patent market exclusivity on all forms of the biological containing the active moiety pursuant to the BPCA if the conditions under the BPCA are met.
In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree to a PIP with the EMA and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a deferral or waiver is granted by the EMA on request by the applicant (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The PIP requirement also applies when a MA holder intends to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicinal product that has already been authorized. The MAA for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Once all the studies and measures agreed have been conducted in accordance with the PIP, products are eligible for a six -month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two -year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is granted subject to specific conditions. These conditions include that the applicant demonstrates having complied with all the measures contained in the PIP, that the summary of product characteristics, and if appropriate the package leaflet, reflects the results of studies conducted in compliance with such PIP, and that the product is authorized in all Member States. The rewards for conducting studies in the pediatric population can be granted irrespective of the fact that the information generated in compliance with the agreed PIP fails to lead to the authorization of a pediatric indication.
Privacy and Security Legislation
In the ordinary course of our business, we may process personal or sensitive data. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy, security, and protection. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (EU GDPR), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (UK) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (UK GDPR).
The legislative and regulatory environments regarding privacy and data protection are continually evolving and developing, in response to increasing global attention. In the U.S., for example, we are subject to the CCPA along with the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA). The CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collecting, using, and disclosing personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. In addition, the CPRA, effective January 1, 2023, expanded the CCPA. The CPRA, among other things, gives California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, establish restrictions on personal data retention, expands the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law.
Other jurisdictions where we operate have enacted or proposed similar legislation and/or regulations. Several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. Additionally, we are, or may become, subject to various U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws which require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data.
We are also subject to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation GDPR, which requires that personal data is only collected for specified, explicit and legal purposes as set out in the GDPR or local laws, and the data may then only be processed in a manner consistent with those purposes. The personal data collected and processed must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and processed, it must be held securely, not transferred outside of the EEA (unless certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection), and must not be retained for longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. The GDPR also requires companies processing personal data to implement adequate technical measures in order to ensure the most appropriate level of security which may vary depending on different factors such as the categories of processed personal data, the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In addition, the GDPR requires companies processing personal data to take certain organizational steps to ensure that they have adequate records, policies, security, training and governance frameworks in place to ensure the protection of data subject rights, including as required to respond to complaints and requests from data subjects. For example, the GDPR requires us to make more detailed disclosures to data subjects, requires disclosure of the legal basis on which we can process personal data, provides for conditions under which a valid consent for processing can be obtained, requires the appointment of a data protection officer where sensitive personal data (i.e., health data) is processed on a large scale, imposes mandatory data breach notification throughout the EEA and imposes additional obligations when contracting with service providers or partners. In addition, to the extent a company processes, controls or otherwise uses “special category” of personal data (including patients’ health or medical information, genetic information and biometric information), more stringent rules apply, further limiting the circumstances and the manner in which a company is legally permitted to process that data.
Failure to comply with these laws could result in significant penalties, including, under GDPR, fines of up to 20 million Euro or 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. The CCPA and EU GDPR are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal data processing that may increase compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,082 full-time employees worldwide, of whom 1,343 were in operations, 736 were in research and development, 495 were in sales and marketing and 508 were in administration. Of the 3,082 full-time employees as of December 31, 2022, 2,066 employees were in the U.S. and Canada, and 1,016 employees were in other non-U.S. countries, including 818 in Europe and the Middle East, 129 in Latin America and 69 in Asia Pacific. We also leverage temporary workers to fill short-term positions for our business and manufacturing needs. A significant portion of our employee base in the U.S. and Ireland works onsite supporting manufacturing and laboratory operations. As restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic have eased, 
a significant portion of our global workforce who worked remotely during the pandemic has made a return to their respective office locations on a hybrid basis, with a small number of employees continuing to fully work remotely.
On October 6, 2022, we announced a plan to simplify our organization, which included a planned reduction in headcount of approximately 120 employees (representing approximately 4% of the Company’s global workforce), most of whom were from the Company's U.S. operations.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
At BioMarin, prejudice, racism and intolerance are unacceptable. We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) across all aspects of our organization, including hiring, promotion and development practices. At the direction of BioMarin's senior leadership team, our human resources department has implemented policies and programs to foster DEI at all levels of the organization. In addition, the Corporate Governance and Nominating and Compensation Committees of our Board of Directors regularly receive reports on our DEI policies and programs and offer valuable insights and recommendations to management in addition to providing appropriate oversight. 
As of December 31, 2022, racial and ethnic minorities represented 47% of our employees in the U.S. Globally, 50% of our workforce were women and 47% of our positions at director-level and above were held by women. We are committed to continuing our ongoing efforts to ensure diversity in all positions, including leadership. 
We remain steadfast in our commitment to fostering a community that reflects equality and inclusiveness and working towards making BioMarin a place where every employee feels heard, respected and valued. This commitment is a cultural value, and we believe incorporating and encouraging different perspectives from employees of varied backgrounds and experiences helps us better serve our patients, achieve our business goals and objectives and provide employees with a fulfilling work experience. Since 2020, BioMarin’s DEI Employee Advisory Committee has helped to define our DEI roadmap and ensure that perspectives from employees of different age, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, tenure, level and location are considered in how we build the most inclusive environment. We also continue to support and increase the number of our employee resource groups that build community for employees from underrepresented groups. In addition, our foundational DEI training is required for all employees, with a 100% global participation rate in 2022, and we offer opportunities for advanced DEI training as well.
We are honored to be recognized as a company of choice. In 2022, we were recognized for the second year in a row as a Best Place to Work for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) equality by the Human Rights Campaign, scoring 100% on their Corporate Equality Index, one of the foremost benchmarking surveys and reports in the U.S. measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. In JUST Capital’s America’s Most JUST Companies 2023 rankings, our overall rank was eight out of 41 in our industry, and our “Workers” rank, which is intended to measure how a company invests in its employees, was 29 out of 951 companies across all industries and 4 out of 41 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
Compensation, Benefits and Well-being
We offer competitive compensation and benefits in order to attract and retain excellent employees and support their overall well-being. Our total rewards compensation package includes market-competitive salary, the potential to earn bonuses or sales commissions, equity, healthcare benefits, retirement savings plans, paid time off and family leave, wellness programs, free flu vaccinations and an Employee Assistance Program and other mental health services. 
We believe employees should be paid for the value of their work, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender or other protected characteristics. To this end, we benchmark and tie compensation to market data as well as to an employee’s experience, function, and performance. We regularly review our workforce compensation practices and strive for equity. Specifically, we partner with independent, third-party experts to conduct a regular and detailed pay equity assessment to determine whether gender and race/ethnicity have a significant impact on pay levels across the organization. This pay equity analysis is conducted on an employee’s total compensation, including base pay, bonus and equity. If we identify any pay gap across the organization, we typically make adjustments to mitigate such gaps. Our managers also receive training in how to recognize and prevent discrimination in hiring, performance management and compensation decisions. 
Professional Growth and Development
We help our employees develop the skills and capabilities to support BioMarin’s growth and innovation. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide them with a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual and self-directed learning, mentoring, mobile coaching and external development. We offer our employees career-specific training and resources and support development opportunities through company sponsored programs in addition to our tuition 
reimbursement program. We also provide our high-potential employees with a variety of leadership coaching and management programs.
Patient and Community Connections
We are striving to support our local communities around the world by developing programs that inspire and enrich both our patient populations and the areas where we live and work. We actively engage with underrepresented populations through a variety of outreach and programs. We collaborate with Biotech Partners, a non-profit organization in the San Francisco Bay Area focused on helping students who are underrepresented in the biotechnology field to gain experience through classroom instruction and paid internships. We also partner with Health Career Connection, a national non-profit that prepares the next generation of diverse, transformational health, equity and racial justice leaders by providing promising undergraduate college students from underrepresented backgrounds and under-resourced communities with paid internship programs, health equity scholars programs and alumni professional development initiatives. In addition, we award annual scholarships to students living with rare disease through our Rare Scholars program.
