Item 1.Business
General Overview
New Media Investment Group Inc. (“New Media,” “Company,” “us,” or “we”) owns, operates and invests in high-quality local media assets focused in small to mid-size markets. With our collection of assets, we are focused on the local audience and small to medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) in our communities.
Our current portfolio of media assets spans across 581 markets and 37 states. Our products include 678 community print publications and 581 websites. As of December 30, 2018, we reached over 22 million people per week and served over 199,000 business customers.
Our mission is to be the local audience and small business expert in the markets that we operate in. We leverage this local expertise to sell our unique, hyperlocal content to consumers and our market-leading technology solutions to SMBs. There are three key elements of our strategy:
1.We aim to grow our business organically through both our consumer and SMB strategies, 
2.We pursue strategic acquisitions of high-quality local media and digital marketing assets at attractive valuation levels, and
3.We intend to distribute a portion of our free cash flow generated from operations or other sources as a dividend to stockholders through a quarterly dividend, subject to satisfactory financial performance, approval by our board of directors (the “Board of Directors” or “Board”) and dividend restrictions in the New Media Credit Agreement (as defined below). The Board of Directors’ determinations regarding dividends will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) net income, free cash flow generated from operations or other sources, liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash, such as acquisitions, as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results. 
We believe that our focus on owning and operating leading local-content-oriented media properties in small to mid-size markets puts us in a position to better execute on our strategy. We believe that being the leading provider of local news and information in the markets in which we operate, and distributing that content across multiple print and digital platforms, gives us an opportunity to grow our audiences and reach. Further, we believe our strong local media brands and our market presence give us the opportunity to expand our advertising and lead generation products with local business customers. 
For our SMB category, we focus on leveraging our strong local media brands, our in-market sales force and our high consumer penetration rates to offer technology solutions that allow SMBs to operate efficiently and effectively in a digital world. Central to this business strategy is our wholly-owned subsidiary UpCurve, Inc. ("UpCurve"). UpCurve provides two broad categories of services: ThriveHive, previously known as Propel Marketing, which provides guided marketing solutions for SMBs, and UpCurve Cloud, which offers cloud-based products with expert guidance and support. ThriveHive is designed to offer a complete set of turn-key guided marketing and business solutions to SMBs that provide transparent results to the business owners. In 2016, we acquired a turn-key proprietary software application that enables SMB owners to run their own digital and guided marketing campaigns, and we have made a number of strategic acquisitions since. 
We launched the UpCurve products in 2012 and have seen rapid growth since then. We believe UpCurve, combined with our strong local brands and in-market sales force, is positioned to continue to be a key contributor to our overall organic growth strategy. UpCurve is well positioned to seize upon the approximately 30.2 million SMBs in the U.S. in 2015 according to the U.S. Small Business Administration. Of these, approximately 29.0 million had 20 employees or fewer.
Many of the owners and managers of these SMBs do not have the resources or expertise to navigate the fast evolving workplace technologies market but are increasingly aware of the need to embrace the digital disruption to their business model. 
GateHouse Live, our events and promotions business, was started in late 2015 to leverage our local brands to create world-class events in the markets we serve.  In 2018, GateHouse Live produced over 350 events with a collective attendance over 400,000.  Among our core event offerings are a variety of themed expos focused on target audiences, including men, women, seniors and young families.  Other signature event series produced across many of our markets include one of the nation's largest high school sports recognition events and the official community's choice awards for dozens of markets across the country.  In 2018, GateHouse Live expanded into endurance events that include a network of over 90 marathons, half 
marathons, other footraces and obstacle course races across the United States and Canada with over 250,000 attendees annually.  GateHouse Live also offers white label event services for retailers and other media companies.
Portfolio Detail
Our core products include:

• | 146 daily newspapers with total paid circulation of approximately 1.5 million;


• | 323 weekly newspapers (published up to three times per week) with total paid circulation of approximately 268,000 and total free circulation of approximately 1.4 million;


• | 132 “shoppers” (generally advertising-only publications) with total circulation of approximately 3.1 million;


• | 581 locally-focused websites, which extend our businesses onto the internet and mobile devices with approximately 364 million page views per month;


• | 77 business publications;


• | UpCurve Cloud and ThriveHive digital marketing; and


• | GateHouse Live.

In addition to our core products, we also opportunistically produce niche publications that address specific local market interests such as recreation, sports, healthcare and real estate. Our print and online products focus on the local community from a content, advertising, and digital marketing perspective. As a result of our focus on small and mid-size markets, we are usually the primary, and, sometimes the sole provider of comprehensive local market news and information in the communities we serve. Our content is primarily devoted to topics that we believe are highly relevant and of interest to our audiences such as local news and politics, community and regional events, youth sports, opinion and editorial pages, local schools, obituaries, weddings and police reports. 
We believe our local media properties and local sales infrastructure are uniquely positioned to sell digital marketing and business services to local business owners and give us distinct advantages, including:

• | our strong and trusted local brands, with 88% of our daily newspapers having published local content for more than 100 years;


• | our ability to market through our print and online properties, driving branding and traffic; and


• | our more than 1,160 local, direct, in-market sales professionals with long-standing relationships with small businesses in the communities we serve.

More than 88% of our daily newspapers have been published for more than 100 years, and all have been published for more than 50 years. We believe that the longevity of our publications demonstrates the value and relevance of the local information that we provide and has created a strong foundation of reader loyalty and a highly-recognized media brand name in each community we serve. As a result of these factors, we believe that our publications have high local audience penetration rates in our markets, thereby providing advertisers with strong local market reach.
We believe the large number of publications we have, our focus on smaller markets, and our geographic diversity also provide the following benefits to our strategy:

• | Diversified revenue streams, both in terms of customers and markets;


• | Operational efficiencies realized from clustering of business assets;


• | Operational efficiencies realized from centralization of back office functions;


• | Operational efficiencies realized from improved buying power for key operating cost items through our increased size and scale;


• | Ability to provide consistent management practices and ensure best practices; and


• | Less competition and high barriers to entry.

The revenues derived from our SMB category come from a variety of print and guided online marketing and business solutions products we offer through UpCurve and commercial printing services. Our consumer revenue category comes primarily from subscription income from consumers that pay for our deep, rich local content, primarily in print and also online.
Our operating costs consist primarily of labor, newsprint, and delivery costs. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of labor costs. Compensation represents just under 50% of our expenses. Over the last few years, we have worked to drive efficiencies and centralization of work throughout our Company. Additionally, we have taken steps to cluster our operations, thereby increasing the production volume of our facilities and equipment while increasing the productivity of our labor force. We expect to continue to employ these steps as part of our business strategy.
New Media was formed as a Delaware corporation on June 18, 2013. New Media had no operations until November 26, 2013, when it assumed control of GateHouse Media, Inc. ("GateHouse") and Local Media Group Holdings LLC. GateHouse was determined to be the predecessor to New Media, as the operations of GateHouse comprised substantially all of the business operations of the combined companies. Pursuant to a restructuring, Newcastle Investment Corp. (“Newcastle”) owned approximately 84.6% of New Media until February 13, 2014, upon which date Newcastle distributed the shares that it held in New Media to its shareholders on a pro rata basis. New Media is externally managed and advised by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC (“Fortress”).
Management Agreement
On November 26, 2013, New Media entered into a management agreement (as amended and restated, the "Management Agreement") with FIG LLC (the "Manager"), an affiliate of Fortress, pursuant to which the Manager manages the operations of New Media. We pay the Manager an annual management fee equal to 1.50% of New Media’s Total Equity (as defined in the Management Agreement), and the Manager is eligible to receive incentive compensation. On December 27, 2017, SoftBank Group Corp. (“SoftBank”) acquired Fortress (the “SoftBank Merger”). Subsequent to the SoftBank Merger, Fortress operates within SoftBank as an independent business headquartered in New York. Fortress’s senior investment professionals who perform services for us have and are expected to continue to remain in place.
Acquisitions
During 2016, we acquired substantially all the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of certain publications/businesses, which included 68 business publications, seven daily newspapers, seven weekly publications, eleven shoppers and digital platforms for an aggregate purchase price of $135.9 million, including working capital. 
During 2017, we acquired substantially all the assets, properties, and business of certain publications/businesses, which included four business publications, 22 daily newspapers, 34 weekly publications, 24 shoppers, two customer relationship management solutions providers, a social media app and an event production business for an aggregate purchase price of $165.1 million, including working capital.
During 2018, we acquired substantially all the assets, properties, and business of certain publications/businesses, which included seven business publications, eight daily newspapers, 16 weekly newspapers, one shopper, a print facility, an events production business, cloud services and digital platforms and related domains, for an aggregate purchase price of $205.7 million, including estimated working capital and contingent consideration.
Long-Lived Asset Impairment
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company ceased printing operations at 15 facilities as part of ongoing cost reduction programs.  As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge related to retired equipment of $7.1 million and accelerated depreciation of $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.
 During the year ended December 30, 2018, the Company ceased operations of seven print publications and six printing operations as part of ongoing cost reduction programs. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge related to retired equipment of $0.5 million and intangibles of $0.6 million and accelerated depreciation of $3.6 million during the year ended December 30, 2018.
Dispositions
On June 2, 2017, we completed the sale of the Mail Tribune, located in Medford, Oregon, for approximately $14.7 million, including working capital.  As a result, a pre-tax gain of approximately $5.4 million, net of selling expenses, is included in net (gain) loss on sale or disposal of assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) during the year ended December 31, 2017.
On February 27, 2018, the Company sold a parcel of land and a building located in Framingham, Massachusetts for a sale price of $9.3 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $3.3 million, net of selling expenses, which is included in 
net (gain) loss on sale or disposal of assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) during the year ended December 30, 2018.
On May 11, 2018, the Company completed its sale of certain publications and related assets in Alaska for approximately $2.4 million, including working capital. As a result, a nominal pre-tax gain, net of selling expenses, is included in net (gain) loss on sale or disposal of assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) during the year ended December 30, 2018.
Subsequent Events
Dividends
On February 27, 2019, we announced a fourth quarter 2018 cash dividend of $0.38 per share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of New Media ("New Media Common Stock" or our "Common Stock"). The dividend will be paid on March 20, 2019, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 11, 2019.
Acquisitions
On January 31, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of substantially all of the publishing and related assets of Schurz Communications, Inc. for $30 million, plus working capital. The acquisition was financed from cash on hand. The acquisition includes ten daily newspapers, nine weekly publications and fourteen other community publications serving areas of Indiana, Maryland, South Dakota and Michigan.
Industry Overview
We operate in what is sometimes referred to as the “hyper-local” or community news markets within the media industry. Media companies that serve this segment provide highly-focused local content and advertising that is generally unique to each market they serve and is not readily obtainable from other sources. Local publications include community newspapers, websites, shoppers, traders, real estate guides, special interest magazines and directories. Due to the unique local nature of their content and audience, community publications compete for advertising customers with other forms of traditional media, including direct mail, directories, radio, television, and outdoor advertising. They also compete with new local and national digital and social media businesses for advertising and digital and business services customers. We believe that local print and online publications in smaller markets are the most effective medium for local retail advertising, which emphasizes the price of goods in an effort to move inventory on a regular basis, in contrast to radio, broadcast and cable, television, and the internet, which are generally used for image or branding advertising. In addition, we believe local print and online publications generally have the highest local audience penetration rates, which allows local advertisers to get their message to a large portion of the local audience. Finally, national digital competitors tend to have no local in-market sales presence, which we believe gives the local community publications an advantage when selling these types of products and services.
Locally-focused media in small and mid-size communities is distinct from national and urban media delivered through outlets such as television, radio, metropolitan and national newspapers and the internet. Larger media outlets tend to offer broad based information to a geographically-scattered audience, which tends to be more of a commodity. In contrast, locally-focused media delivers a highly-focused product that is often the only source of local news and information in the market it serves. Our segment of the media industry is also characterized by high barriers to entry, both economic and social. Small and mid-size communities can generally only sustain one newspaper. Moreover, the brand value associated with long-term reader and advertiser loyalty and the high start-up costs associated with developing and distributing content and selling advertisements help to limit competition.
We also believe there is a growing need among SMBs to be able to generate leads and interact with consumers across all digital platforms -- including websites, mobile sites, mobile and tablet applications, and social media. These local business owners and managers lack the time, expertise and resources to capitalize on the potential of these consumer-reaching channels. National competitors in this category do not generally have a local in-market presence. Newly-formed competitors lack a known and credible brand name and generally do not have a local in-market presence. We believe this represents a substantial opportunity for our local media business.
Advertising Market
The primary sources of advertising revenue for local publications are small businesses, corporations, government agencies and individuals that reside in the market that a publication serves. By combining paid circulation publications with total market coverage (“TMC”) publications, such as shoppers and other specialty publications (tailored to the specific attributes of a local community), local publications are able to reach nearly 100% of the households in a distribution area. As macroeconomic conditions in advertising change, due to increasing internet and mobile usage and the wide array of available 
information sources, we have seen advertisers shift their focus to incorporate a digital advertising and services component into their overall local marketing strategy. To that end, in addition to printed products, the majority of our local publications have an online presence that further leverages the local brand, ensures higher penetration into the market, and provides a digital alternative for local advertisers to reach consumers. We also have strong digital marketing and business services offered through ThriveHive and UpCurve Cloud.
Digital Media
The time spent online and on mobile devices each day by media consumers continues to grow, and newspaper websites offer a wide variety of content providing comprehensive, in-depth and up-to-the-minute coverage of news and current events. The ability to generate, publish and archive more news and information than most other sources has allowed newspapers to produce some of the most visited sites on the internet. 
We believe that our local publications are well positioned to capitalize on their existing market presence and grow their total audience base by publishing proprietary local content digitally: via the internet and mobile applications. Local digital media include traditional classifieds, directories of business information, local advertising, databases, audience-contributed content and mobile applications. We believe this additional community-specific content will further extend and expand both the reach and the brand of our publications with readers and advertisers. We believe that building a strong local digital business extends the core audience of a local publication.
The opportunity created by the digital extension of the core audience makes local digital advertising an attractive complement for existing print advertisers, while opening up opportunities to attract new local advertisers that have not previously advertised with local publications. In addition, we believe that national advertisers have an interest in reaching buyers on a hyper-local level and, although they historically have not been significant advertisers in community publications, we believe that digital media offers them a powerful medium to reach local audiences. We seek to attract national advertisers in part through our behavioral-targeting products, which allow advertisers to reach specific demographics of our audience and follow that audience across multiple websites, delivering advertisements across the platforms. As a digital marketing services businesses, we are poised to benefit from the rise in internet marketing spend, which grew 21% between 2016 and 2017, and 315% between 2007 and 2018, according to the 2017 IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report issued in May 2018.
We believe that a strong digital business will enhance our revenues. In addition, we believe that we have the expertise and sales resources to help other businesses maximize their digital opportunities. UpCurve, which we started in order to focus on helping SMBs adopt technology solutions, has grown its digital and business services revenue derived from advertising, marketing, and other revenue since the launch of ThriveHive in 2012. New Media’s digital and business services revenue was $179.2 million for the year ended December 30, 2018, a 25.0% growth as compared with the same period in 2017, which had digital and business services revenue of $143.4 million. Of this, $95.8 million, or 53.5% of digital revenue for the year ended December 30, 2018 was attributable to UpCurve. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We have invested in UpCurve, but such investments may not be successful, which could adversely affect our results of operations.”
We anticipate that the digital marketing and business services sector will continue to grow as SMBs move from print to digital marketing in connection with consumers spending more time online. According to a BIA Advisory Services, digital revenues are expected to grow to $59.6 billion in 2019. We believe that UpCurve is well positioned to assist SMBs in the digital space and expect UpCurve to contribute meaningfully to future revenue growth.
Circulation
Overall daily newspaper print circulation, including national and urban newspapers, has been declining over the past several years. Small and mid-size local market newspapers, however, have generally had smaller declines and more stability in their paid print circulation volumes due to the relevant and unique hyper-local news they produce combined with less competition than in larger markets. In addition, we believe this unique and valuable hyper-local content, along with the multiple delivery platforms that are now available, will allow smaller market newspapers to continue to raise prices, leading to stable circulation revenues. Data and technology now available to newspaper companies allow them to target pricing more at the household level rather than purely by market. This will lead to more effective pricing strategies and enhance stability for circulation revenues. 
Our Strengths
High Quality Assets with Leading Local Businesses. Our publications benefit from a long history in the communities we serve as one of the leading, and often, the sole providers of comprehensive local content. More than 88% of our daily newspapers have been published for more than 100 years, and all have been published for more than 50 years. This has resulted in brand recognition for our publications, reader loyalty and high local audience penetration rates, which are highly valued by 
local advertisers. We continue to build on long-standing relationships with local advertisers and our in-depth knowledge of the consumers in our local markets. We believe our local news content is unique and highly valued by consumers who live in our markets, and there are limited, and in some cases no competing sources of local content for our target customers.
Large Locally Focused Sales Force. We have large and well known “in-market” local sales forces in the markets we serve, consisting of over 1,160 sales representatives, including 61 dedicated to UpCurve and seven third-party sales affiliations. Our sales forces are generally among the largest locally-oriented media sales forces in their respective communities. We have long-standing relationships with many local businesses and have the ability to be face to face with most local businesses due to these unique characteristics we enjoy. We believe our strong brands combined with our “in-market” presence give us a distinct advantage in selling and growing in the digital services sector given the complex nature of these products. We also believe that these qualities provide leverage for our sales force to grow additional future revenue streams in our markets, particularly in the digital sector.
Ability to Acquire and Integrate New Assets. We have created a national platform for consolidating local media businesses and have demonstrated an ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate local media asset acquisitions. Together with our predecessor, we have acquired over $2.7 billion of assets since 2006, including traditional newspaper, business publication, business services and directory businesses. We have a scalable infrastructure and platform to leverage for future acquisitions.
Scale Yields Operating Profit Margins and Allows Us to Realize Operating Synergies. We believe we can generate higher operating profit margins than our publications could achieve on a stand-alone basis by leveraging our operations and implementing revenue initiatives, especially digital and business services initiatives, across a broader local footprint in a geographic cluster and by centralizing certain back-office production, accounting, administrative and corporate operations. We also benefit from economies of scale in the purchase of insurance, newsprint and other large strategic supplies and equipment. Finally, we have the ability to further leverage our centralized services and buying power to reduce operating costs when making future strategic accretive acquisitions.
Local Business Profile Generates Significant Cash Flow. Our local business profile allows us to generate significant recurring cash flow due to our diversified revenue base and high operating profit margins while maintaining our low capital expenditure and working capital requirements. As of December 30, 2018, our debt structure consists of the New Media Credit Agreement and Advantage Credit Agreement (as defined below). We believe that we have the ability to generate significant free cash flow that has the potential to lead to stockholder value creation through our investments in organic growth, investments in accretive acquisitions and the return of cash to stockholders in the form of dividends, subject to satisfactory financial performance, approval by our Board of Directors and dividend restrictions in the New Media Credit Agreement. We further believe the strong cash flows generated and available to be invested will lead to consistent future dividend growth.
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team is made up of executives who have an average of over 27 years of experience in the media industry, including strong traditional and digital media expertise. Our management team has broad industry experience with regard to both growing new digital and business services lines and identifying and integrating strategic acquisitions. Our management team also has key strengths in managing geographically dispersed teams, including the sales force, and identifying and centralizing duplicate functions across businesses leading to reduced core infrastructure costs.
Our Strategy
We intend to create stockholder value through a variety of factors including organic growth driven by our consumer and SMB strategies, pursuing attractive strategic acquisitions of high-quality local media assets, and through the distribution of a portion of our free cash flow generated from operations and other sources as a dividend, subject to satisfactory financial performance, approval by our Board of Directors and dividend restrictions in the New Media Credit Agreement. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to accomplish any of these strategic initiatives.
A key component of our strategy is to acquire and operate traditional local media businesses and transform them from print-centric operations to dynamic multi-media operations through our existing online advertising, guided marketing and business solutions. We will also leverage our existing platform to operate these businesses more efficiently. We believe all of these initiatives will lead to revenue and cash flow growth for New Media. We intend to distribute a portion of our free cash flow generated from operations and other sources as a dividend to stockholders, through a quarterly dividend, subject to satisfactory financial performance, approval by our Board of Directors and dividend restrictions in the New Media Credit Agreement. The Board of Directors’ determinations regarding dividends will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s GAAP net income, free cash flow generated from operations or other sources, liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash, such as acquisitions, as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results. The key elements of our strategy include:
Maintain Our Leading Position in the Delivery of Proprietary Local Content in Our Communities. We seek to maintain our position as a leading provider of unique local content in the markets we serve and to leverage this position to strengthen our relationships with both readers and local businesses, thereby increasing penetration rates and market share. A critical aspect of this approach is to continue to provide local content that is not readily obtainable elsewhere and to be able to deliver that content to our customers across multiple print and digital platforms.
Grow Our Digital Marketing and Business Services. We plan to continue to scale and expand our guided marketing and business solutions platform, UpCurve. We believe UpCurve will allow us to sell guided marketing and business solutions to SMBs both in and outside of existing New Media markets. The SMB demand for digital and business service solutions is great and represents a rapidly expanding opportunity. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, in 2015 there were approximately 30.2 million SMBs in the U.S. and, according to a BIA Advisory Services, digital revenues are expected to grow to $59.6 billion in 2019. Owners of SMBs often lack the resources and expertise to navigate the digital marketing services sector, with 29% of SMBs not having a website, and 17% of SMBs with websites do not have a mobile-friendly website according to Clutch’s 2017 Small Business Survey. We believe local SMBs will turn to our trusted local media brands to help them navigate through developing their digital marketing presence and business strategy. We believe our local media properties and local sales infrastructure gives us a distinct advantage to being the leading local provider of digital marketing and business services.
Pursue Strategic Accretive Acquisitions. We intend to capitalize on the highly fragmented and distressed local print industries which have greatly reduced valuation levels. We continue to expect to focus our investments primarily in the local newspaper sector in small to mid-size markets. We believe we have a strong operational platform as well as scalable digital marketing and business services. This platform, along with our deep industry-specific knowledge and our experienced management team, can be leveraged to reduce costs, stabilize the core business and grow digital revenues at acquired properties. The size and fragmentation of the addressable print media market place in the United States, the greatly reduced valuation levels that exist in these industries, and our deep experience make this an attractive place for our initial consolidation focus and capital allocation. Over the longer term we also believe there may be opportunity to diversify and acquire these types of assets internationally, as well as other traditional local media assets such as broadcast TV, out of home advertising (billboards) and radio, in the United States and internationally. We also believe there may be opportunities to acquire other strong businesses that have strong local brands and local sales infrastructure or digital product companies, both of which could quickly scale our digital marketing and business services platform.
Stabilize Our Core Business Operations. We have four primary drivers in our strategic plans to stabilize our core business operations, including: (i) identifying permanent structural expense reductions in our traditional business cost infrastructure and re-deploying a portion of those costs toward future growth opportunities, primarily on the digital side of our business; (ii) accelerating the growth of both our digital audiences and revenues through improvements to current products, new product development, training, opportunistic changes in hiring to create an employee base with a more diversified skill set and sharing of best practices; (iii) accelerating our consumer revenue growth through subscription pricing increases, pay meters for digital content and growth in our overall subscriber base; and (iv) stabilizing our core print advertising revenues through improvements to pricing, packaging of products for customers that will produce the best results for them, and more technology and training for sales management and sales representatives.
New Media intends to focus its business strategy on building its digital marketing and business services and growing its online advertising business. With its improved capital structure and digital focus, combined with its strengths and strategy and dividend strategy, we believe that New Media will be able to grow stockholder value. However, there can be no assurance of this. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Challenges
As a publisher of locally-based print and online media, we face a number of challenges, including the risks that:

• | the growing shift within the publishing industry from traditional print media to digital forms of publication may compromise our ability to generate sufficient advertising revenues;


• | investments in growing our digital and business services may not be successful, which could adversely affect our results of operations;


• | our advertising and circulation revenues may decline if we are unable to compete effectively with other companies in the local media industry; and


• | we may not be able to successfully acquire local print media assets at attractive valuations due to a rise in valuations from a more competitive landscape of acquirers.

For more information about New Media’s risks and challenges, see “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Guided by a veteran team of award-winning journalists and attorneys, the Legal Group provides relevant, actionable news, analysis and legal opinions for lawyers, judges and legislators.

Leveraging its proprietary surveys, Best Companies Group collects data from employers and employees of its client companies and then analyzes that information to assess employee engagement. Based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Best Companies also conducts custom research projects within industries such as automotive, banking and healthcare.
Home Furnishings Division. Formerly known as Progressive Business Media, the Home Furnishings Division was acquired in November 2018. Based in Greensboro, North Carolina, this division is anchored by Furniture Today, a weekly publication, and several monthly publications, including Home Accents Today, Casual Living, HFN, Exterior Design, Designers Today, Gifts & Decorative Accessories, Kids Today and Home Textiles Today. The Home Furnishings Division produces several live events, including the annual Furniture Today Leadership Conference. The division also has a custom solutions team that builds advertisements, logos, custom content, videos and other marketing assets for the division’s advertising clients.
UpCurve
We believe that SMBs will adopt digital solutions to manage every aspect of their businesses and we created UpCurve to pursue that opportunity. UpCurve is focused on building technology solutions that allow SMBs to operate efficiently and effectively in an increasingly digital world. UpCurve provides two broad categories of solutions: ThriveHive, which provides guided marketing solutions for SMBs, and UpCurve Cloud, which offers best-in-breed cloud-based products for SMBs with expert guidance and support.
Through both organic and inorganic growth initiatives, UpCurve has grown into a recognized leader in the SMB space. In February of 2016 we acquired ThriveHive, an award-winning marketing automation system for SMBs, and subsequently rebranded our marketing division, formerly Propel Marketing, to ThriveHive. We also acquired ViWo, a SMB cloud product provider and W-Systems, a CRM provider in 2016. In 2017, ThriveHive won a national award from the Local Media Association for Best Digital Agency and in November of 2017 we acquired Closely, makers of the guided social marketing application Perch. In 2018, we released the free ThriveHive Grader product to help guide businesses to achieve better search engine optimization. Additionally, in 2018 we started attracting large affinity associations, which resulted in signed partnerships with the American Society of Interior Designers and the Associated Bodywork & Massage Professionals.
There were approximately 29.6 million SMBs in the U.S. in 2014 and about 29.0 million had 20 employees or less according to the U.S. Small Business Administration. Although these businesses are increasingly beginning to recognize the need to leverage technology solutions to operate their businesses, most do not have the time, expertise or resources to handle this themselves. This has led UpCurve to focus on guided solutions that bridge the gap between the needs and the capabilities of SMBs. Through guidance, provided by the right blend of software and service, we are able to help small businesses effectively utilize technology solutions. Because most SMBs in the United States are not yet using comprehensive technology solutions to operate their businesses, we see a large market opportunity using guidance to drive customer adoption and retention.
In order to rapidly scale to meet the large market opportunity, we have been able to successfully leverage the unique trusted local GateHouse brands. We believe that significant media reach, combined with a large local salesforce in our operating markets has enabled us to sell our guided solutions much faster and more efficiently than we could have done without the GateHouse brands. We expect this unique relationship to allow us to continue to drive sales of existing products, as well as any potential new products that we may add to the UpCurve portfolio. As our scale has [expanded] our product and brand leadership, we are seeing increasing sales outside of our GateHouse geographic boundaries. We expect both future publication acquisitions and adoption outside of GateHouse markets to allow us to effectively further pursue the market opportunity.
GateHouse Live
Founded in late 2015, our community events and promotions business, GateHouse Live, leverages our local brands to create world-class events in the markets that we serve. In 2018, GateHouse Live produced over 350 annual events with a collective attendance over 400,000.  Among our core event offerings are a variety of themed expos focused on target audiences, including men, women, seniors and young families.  Other signature event series produced across many of our markets include one of the nation's largest high school sports recognition events and the official community's choice awards for dozens of markets across the country.  In 2018, GateHouse Live expanded into endurance events that include a network of over 90 marathons, half marathons, other footraces and obstacle course races across the United States and Canada with over 250,000 attendees annually.  GateHouse Live also offers white label event services for retailers and other media companies.
Revenue
Our operations generate revenue primarily from three primary sources: (i) advertising, (ii) circulation (including home delivery subscriptions, single copy sales and digital subscriptions) and (iii) other (primarily commercial printing, alternate delivery, digital marketing and business services and events). In 2018, these revenue streams accounted for approximately 48%, 38% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenue. The contribution of advertising, circulation and other revenue to our total revenue for New Media for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016 was as follows:

 | Year Ended December 30, 2018 | | Year Ended December 31, 2017 | | Year Ended December 25, 2016
(in thousands) | | | | | 
Revenue: | | | | | 
Advertising | $ | 728,327 | | | $ | 683,990 | | $ | 684,900 
Circulation | 574,963 | | | 474,324 | | | 421,497
Commercial printing and other | 222,734 | | | 183,690 | | | 148,959
Total revenue | $ | 1,526,024 | | | $ | 1,342,004 | | $ | 1,255,356

Advertising
Advertising revenue, which includes revenue generated from online and mobile products, is the largest component of our revenue, accounting for approximately 48%, 51% and 55% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We categorize advertising as follows:

• | Local Retail—local retailers, local stores for national retailers, grocers, drug stores, department and furniture stores, local financial institutions, niche shops, restaurants and other consumer related businesses.


• | Local Classified—local legal, obituaries, employment, automotive, real estate and other advertising.


• | Online—banner, display, classified, behavioral targeting, audience extension, search and other advertising on websites or mobile devices.


• | National—national and major accounts such as wireless communications companies, airlines and hotels, generally placed with us through agencies.

We believe that our advertising revenue tends to be less volatile than the advertising revenue of large metropolitan and national print media because we rely primarily on local, rather than national advertising and our classified revenue tends to be more local market oriented (job listing, for example). We generally derive 95% or more of our advertising revenue from local advertising (local retail, local classified and online) and less than 5% from national advertising. We believe that local advertising tends to be less sensitive to economic cycles than national advertising because local businesses generally have fewer effective advertising channels through which they may reach their customers.
Our advertising rate structures vary among our publications and are a function of various factors, including local market conditions, competition, circulation, readership and demographics. Management works with local newspaper management to set advertising rates and a portion of our publishers’ incentive compensation is based upon growing advertising revenue. Our sales compensation program emphasizes digital and new business growth. We share advertising concepts throughout our network of publishers and advertising directors, including periodic special section programs, enabling them to utilize advertising products and sales strategies that are successful in other markets we serve.
Substantially all of our advertising revenue is derived from a diverse group of local retailers and local classified advertisers, resulting in very limited customer concentration. No single advertiser accounted for more than 1% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016 and our 20 largest advertisers account for less than 10% of total revenue.
Our advertising revenue tends to follow a seasonal pattern, with higher advertising revenue in months containing significant events or holidays. Accordingly, our first quarter, followed by our third quarter, historically, are our weakest quarters of the year in terms of revenue. Correspondingly, our second and fourth fiscal quarters, historically, are our strongest quarters. We expect that this seasonality will continue to affect our advertising revenue in future periods.
We have experienced declines in advertising revenue over the past few years, due primarily to the secular pressures on the business as consumers and advertisers shift time and spend from traditional media to the internet. We continue to search for organic growth opportunities, specifically with digital advertising and ways to stabilize print revenue declines through strengthening local news product, value based pricing and training of sales staff.
Circulation
Our circulation revenue is derived from home delivery sales to subscribers, single copy sales at retail stores and vending racks and boxes, and digital subscriptions. We own 146 paid daily publications that range in circulation from approximately 500 to 101,000 and 194 paid weekly publications that range in circulation from approximately 100 to 14,000. Circulation revenue accounted for approximately 38%, 35% and 34% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016, respectively.
Subscriptions are typically sold for three to twelve-month terms and often include promotions to extend the average subscription period or convert someone to become a subscriber. We also provide bundled print and digital subscriptions and employ pay meters for our website content at most of our daily publications. We implement marketing programs to increase readership through subscription and single copy sales, including company-wide and local circulation contests, direct mail programs, door-to-door sales and strategic alliances with local schools in the form of “Newspapers in Education” programs. In addition, since the adoption of the Telemarketing Sales Rule by the Federal Trade Commission in 2003, which created a national “do not call” registry, we have increased our use of “EZ Pay” programs, kiosks, sampling programs, in-paper promotions and online promotions to increase our circulation.
We encourage subscriber use of EZ Pay, a monthly credit card charge or direct bank debit payment program, which has led to higher retention rates for subscribers. We also use an active stop-loss program for all expiring subscribers. Additionally, in order to improve our circulation revenue and circulation trends, we periodically review the need for quality enhancements, such as:

• | Consumer research to better understand local content of interest;


• | Increasing the amount of unique hyper-local content;


• | Increasing the use of color and color photographs;


• | Improving graphic design, including complete redesigns;


• | Developing creative and interactive promotional campaigns;


• | Improving customer service and company-wide customer retention efforts; and


• | Better use of demographic data to specifically target pricing and customer acquisition opportunities.

We believe that our unique and valuable hyper-local content allows us to continue to produce products of great relevance to our local market audiences. This allows us to be able to periodically raise prices, both for home delivery and on a single copy basis, resulting in increased circulation revenues. We also believe this unique hyper-local content will allow us to find ways to grow circulation revenues from our wide array of digital products.
Other
We provide commercial printing services to third parties on a competitive bid basis as a means to generate incremental revenue and utilize excess printing capacity. These customers consist primarily of other publishers that do not have their own 
printing presses and do not compete with our publications. We also print other commercial materials, including flyers, business cards and invitations. Additionally, this category includes UpCurve which provides digital marketing and business services for SMBs and GateHouse Live, our events business. Other sources of revenue, including commercial printing and UpCurve, accounted for approximately 14%, 14% and 12% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016, respectively.
Printing and Distribution
We own and operate 46 print facilities. Our print facilities produce nine publications on average and are generally located within 60 miles of the communities served. By clustering our production resources or outsourcing where cost beneficial, we are able to reduce the operating costs of our publications while increasing the quality of our small and midsize market publications that would typically not otherwise have access to high quality production facilities. We also believe that we are able to reduce future capital expenditure needs by having fewer overall pressrooms and buildings. We believe our superior production quality is critical to maintaining and enhancing our position as the leading provider of local news coverage in the markets we serve. As other print media businesses look to reduce costs, we believe we have the opportunity to leverage our unutilized press time to grow our commercial print customer base and revenue.
The distribution of our daily newspapers is typically outsourced to independent, locally based, third-party distributors that also distribute a majority of our weekly newspapers and non-newspaper publications. We continuously evaluate lower cost options for newspaper delivery. In addition, certain of our shopper and weekly publications are delivered via the U.S. Postal Service.
Availability of Raw Materials for Our Business—Newsprint
The basic raw material for our publications is newsprint. We generally maintain only a 45 to 55-day inventory of newsprint.
Historically, the market price of newsprint has been volatile, reaching a high of approximately $823 per metric ton in 2008 and a low of $410 per metric ton in 2002. However, from 2010 to 2018, there was much less volatility in newsprint pricing, and we have benefited from negotiating a fixed annual price for a majority of our newsprint. The average market price of newsprint during 2018 was approximately $728 per metric ton.
In 2017, we consumed approximately 115,900 metric tons of newsprint (inclusive of commercial printing), and the cost of our newsprint consumption totaled approximately $66.3 million. In contrast, in 2018, we consumed approximately 117,500 metric tons of newsprint (inclusive of commercial printing), and the cost of our newsprint consumption totaled approximately $85.7 million. Our newsprint expense typically averages less than 6% of total revenue, which we believe generally compares favorably to larger, metropolitan newspapers.
Competition
Each of our publications compete for advertising revenue to varying degrees with traditional media outlets such as direct mail, yellow pages, radio, outdoor advertising, broadcast and cable television, magazines, local, regional and national newspapers, shoppers and other print and online media sources, including local blogs. We also increasingly compete with new digital and social media companies for advertising revenue. However, we believe that competitive barriers to entry remain high in many of the markets we serve in terms of being the preeminent source for local news and information therein, because our markets are generally not large enough to support a second newspaper and because our local news gathering infrastructures, sales networks and relationships would be time consuming and costly to replicate. We also have highly-recognizable local brand names and long histories in the towns we serve.
We also provide our readers with community-specific content, which is generally not available from other media sources. We believe that our direct and focused coverage of the market and our cost effective advertising rates relative to more broadly circulated metropolitan newspapers allow us to tailor an approach for the advertisers. As a result, our publications generally capture a large share of local advertising in the markets they serve.
The level of competition and the primary competitors that we face vary from market to market. Competition tends to be based on market penetration, demographic and quality factors, as opposed to price factors. The competitive environment in each of our operating regions is discussed in greater detail below.
The Boston Globe and boston.com, a metropolitan daily and website, respectively, owned by John Henry, compete with the publications throughout eastern Massachusetts. In addition, competition from other Massachusetts companies include approximately 16 dailies and 50 weeklies, three major radio station operators, five local network television broadcasters, one cable company and numerous niche publications for advertising revenues.
The Cape Cod and New Bedford, Massachusetts newspapers experience competition from weekly newspapers, local radio stations, shopping guides, directories and niche publications.
In Middletown, New York, The Times Herald-Record is the leading print and digital media and has an audience far larger than its competitors, including Daily newspapers owned by Gannett Company, Inc. (Poughkeepsie Journal in Poughkeepsie, New York) and 21st Century Media, Inc. (Daily Freeman in Kingston, New York) which compete within the New York market. The Times Herald-Record also competes with 46 weekly, bi-weekly and monthly print products and Spectrum, radio stations and directories. The market is formally known as the Hudson Valley New York region. In the Middletown market, the nationally known Legoland, already ahead of construction timelines, will open in the spring of 2020 in the heart of the Times Herald-Record footprint. Additionally, a new casino opened on February 2017 in Sullivan County - a market also within the footprint of the Times Herald-Record. This was a one billion dollar project that has full casino, hotels, golf course and waterpark.
The Providence Journal is the leading daily newspaper in the state of Rhode Island and is complimented by the Newport Daily News. Other daily newspaper operators in the state include RISN Operations, Inc., which publish five daily papers and six weekly publications serving communities in Rhode Island. Three other companies publish more than 16 weeklies in Rhode Island. The Providence market has seven local network television stations and three major radio station operators, one cable company and numerous print and online niche publications, such as Rhode Island Monthly Magazine and the business publication, Providence Business News.
The Fayetteville Observer delivers to 10 counties in southeastern North Carolina. It is based in Cumberland County, home to Fayetteville and Fort Bragg, the nation’s largest Army installation. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox affiliates based in Raleigh, Durham and Wilmington cover the Fayetteville region, with at least two stations having small bureaus in Fayetteville. Beasley Broadcast Group and Cumulus Media Inc. dominate the radio market with stations including WFCN 640 AM news talk, WZFX 99.1 FM Foxy 99 urban contemporary, WKML 95.7 FM country, WQSM 98.1 FM hot adult contemporary and WRCQ 103.5 FM rock. Mspark is the primary direct mail competitor. Lamar Advertising and Fairway Outdoor serve the billboard needs of the market. Niche print publications based in Fayetteville include Up & Coming Weekly, CityView Magazine and The Fayetteville Press. The Fayetteville Observer is by far the leading print and digital publication in the region.
Our publications, The Gainesville Sun and Ocala Star Banner, are the leading media in their respective markets, primarily Alachua and Marion counties. Competition in this market include four television stations, which is unusual for markets this size. Gainesville has its own DMA and Ocala falls into the Orlando DMA. There are no other dailies in the market other than a slow movement by the Villages Daily Sun into Marion county (Ocala), a concern due to their offering the lowest home delivery and single copy rates of any Florida daily. They operate as part of one of the fastest-growing developments in the county, The Villages. Our Gainesville Sun also publishes a weekly newspaper, Gainesville Guardian, in east Gainesville and also a very successful city magazine, Gainesville Magazine.
In the Daytona Beach market, The Daytona Beach News-Journal is the leading media. Primary print competition for the west side of the coverage area is the Orlando Sentinel, owned by Tribune Publishing Company. Smaller weekly competitive publications, including The Observer Group and Hometown News, are also in the market. Major radio and network television stations are out of the Orlando market.
In the Sarasota market, The Herald-Tribune publications are generally the leading media and have an audience far larger than the competitors for the main areas we serve. Daily newspapers owned by McClatchy (Bradenton Herald) and Sun Coast Media Group, the Charlotte Sun, border on the north and south ends of the market, respectively and distribute in some circulation areas on the fringes. The Herald-Tribune prints the Bradenton Herald and is contracted to distribute all home delivery copies. The Sarasota market has one local network television station and several local radio station operators and cable companies as well as numerous non-daily print and online niche publications.
Located in central Florida, the publication, The Ledger in Lakeland is bordered by the Orlando Sentinel to the east and the Tampa Bay Times to the west. In addition, competitors include multiple weekly newspapers and two radio stations. The Ledger is the leading media in the central Florida area it serves. The Lakeland Ledger began printing the Orlando Sentinel in September 2017.
In Tuscaloosa and Gadsden, the Tuscaloosa News and Gadsden Times, respectively, are the leading media in the markets they serve. Television that serves both markets is out of Birmingham, Alabama. The digital space is highly competitive with the competing site al.com, owned by Advance Local, which covers the state.
In the Columbus, Ohio market, the advertising competition in print is minimal with just a weekly business journal and a few small monthly magazines. On the electronic and digital side, the competition is intense and is comprised of six network TV 
stations, three cable companies, ten radio stations and twelve digital agencies, with SMART 1 being the most aligned with UpCurve’s product set.
Lee Enterprises publishes the Southern Illinoisan in Carbondale, a regional newspaper that competes with our publication in West Frankfort. We believe our publication is the leading local daily, but regional competition does exist from the larger dailies, shoppers and weekly newspapers. Television competition does not exist in this group because of the geographic location in relation to major markets. There are no local television affiliates in our markets.
In the Upstate New York and northwest Pennsylvania markets, we see competition from major newspaper companies: daily newspapers owned by Gannett Company, Inc. (The Star-Gazette in Elmira, New York and the Chambersburg, Pennsylvania Public-Opinion); Times-Shamrock Company’s Scranton, Pennsylvania The Times-Tribune and Towanda Daily/Sunday Review; Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc.’s Sunbury Daily Item; and Ogden-Nutting’s Williamsport Sun-Gazette.
In the Great Lakes markets, the only significant competition comes from regional television stations in Adrian, Michigan. Competition from other local daily and weekly papers and niche publications, as well as radio and television stations, directories, direct mail and non-local internet websites can be found in the market, but none have proven to be significant.
In the Louisiana markets, major competition comes from regional daily newspapers, such as The Advocate in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and The American Press in Lake Charles, Louisiana. In Central Kansas and Missouri, we compete with The Joplin Globe and the Wichita Eagle. We also face competition from numerous other daily and weekly papers, local radio stations, shopping guides, directories and niche publications. Our community newspapers operate in relatively isolated markets where they are the leading sources of local news and print/digital advertising.
In the Sherman, Texas market, our publications are the leading media with minor competition with The Dallas Morning News, which has minimal circulation and does not focus on local content. We own all the weeklies in the Sherman, Texas market, though there is some weekly competition in outlying Texas and Oklahoma communities. The Herald Democrat also competes with local TV stations and several locally-owned radio stations in the market.
In Arkansas, there is some minor competition from the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in northern Crawford county, Arkansas, but they have limited circulation and news coverage in the Fort Smith market. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette circulates in the market with our publication, The Pine Bluff Commercial, but does not deliver the community coverage that is most relevant to Pine Bluff and the surrounding counties. There are several locally-owned radio stations in the market that also compete with The Pine Bluff Commercial.
In the U.S. mid-western states, our publications control every local weekly and daily paper in Story County, Iowa and have weeklies in other neighboring counties, the principal print competition is the Des Moines Register, but it does not deliver meaningful local community content.
The San Joaquin Media Group, with its flagship, The Record, is the leading local news source in Stockton, California, but there is significant competition for print and digital dollars. In the county, competition comes from three community newspapers, each within 10 miles of Stockton, as well as The Sacramento Bee and Modesto Bee with smaller distribution in the county. Additionally, there are two successful glossy monthly magazines, a business journal, Red Plum (Valassis), Lincoln Center Chronicle monthly, outdoor advertising everywhere and a few digital agencies including the marketing agency, Excelerate, owned by The McClatchy Company.
While there is tougher competition in larger markets as compared to the smaller markets across the Western U.S., the strength of each of these groups comes from being local and having built trusted relationships over the last 100 years. None of our competitors have proven to be significant. Our publications and websites have a rich history in local markets which we believe uniquely positions them for unmatched reach and relevancy.
BridgeTower.  Across the Business and Legal groups, we believe the majority of BridgeTower titles are the leading information provider within their respective niche, and many of our brands face no direct competition. In Baltimore and Minneapolis, we contend with business journals run by American City Business Journals, part of Advance Publications Inc. In states like Pennsylvania, we straddle counties that are covered by other business media but are the leading business brands in Lehigh Valley and Central Pennsylvania. Our monthly magazine Pet Age, geared toward pet store owners, competes with Pet Business and Pet Product News.
In the legal space, we coexist and partner with state bar associations but otherwise face limited direct local competition. ALM continues to be the largest media company covering attorneys, but BridgeTower and ALM’s regional brands operate in separate regions. We believe Best Companies Group maintains the highest market share within the employee satisfaction research vertical, which includes Great Place to Work Institute and Workplace Dynamics.
In the Home Furnishings Division, we believe most of the brands are the leading publications in their segments. However, the magazines focused on exterior and interior design face a number of direct and indirect competitors based on the continued growth in those market segments.
Employees
As of December 30, 2018, we employed 10,638 employees. We employ union personnel at a number of our core publications representing 1,225 employees. As of December 30, 2018, there were 43 collective bargaining agreements covering union personnel. Most of our unionized employees work under collective bargaining agreements that expired in 2018. We believe that relations with our employees are generally good, and we have had no work stoppages at any of our publications.
Environmental Matters
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of our employees based upon existing facts presently known to us. Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other related activities has had, and will continue to have, an impact on our operations, but has been accomplished to date without having a material adverse effect on its operations. While it is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate costs to be incurred due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations and technology, based on information currently known to us and insurance procured with respect to certain environmental matters, we do not expect environmental costs or contingencies to be material or to have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Our operations involve risks in these areas, however, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect us.
