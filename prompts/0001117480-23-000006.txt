ITEM 1.      BUSINESS
Chimerix Overview
Chimerix (Chimerix, we, our, us or the Company) is a biopharmaceutical company whose mission it is to develop medicines that meaningfully improve and extend the lives of patients facing deadly diseases. The Company is focused on developing imipridones as a potential new class of selective cancer therapies. The most advanced imipridone is ONC201 which is in clinical-stage development for H3 K27M-mutant glioma as its lead indication. In addition, imipridone ONC206 is currently in dose escalating clinical trials. 
Imipridones and ONC201 (dordaviprone)
Imipridones are a potential new class of selective cancer therapies. These drug candidates bind specifically with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and mitochondrial caseinolytic protease P (ClpP), which may result in cancer cell death. The imipridone chemical scaffold provides an opportunity to target GPCRs and ClpP with differential specificity and function. This presents an opportunity to develop potential imipridone therapies broadly within cancer and other diseases.
ONC201 (International Nonproprietary Name (INN): dordaviprone) binds with specificity to Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2) and ClpP. ONC201 has been shown to selectively induce cell death in cancer cells by binding to and differentially altering activity of DRD2 and ClpP.
ONC201 Development Program
Following recent interactions with FDA, we believe the best path to approval for ONC201 is successful execution of the Phase 3 ACTION study. Interim data is expected in early 2025, and final data in 2026. 
Phase 3 ACTION Study of ONC201
In November 2022, Chimerix announced the launch of its Phase 3 ACTION study at the annual Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) conference. The ACTION trial enrolls patients shortly after they have completed front-line radiation therapy that is the standard of care for glioma. The study is designed to enroll 450 patients randomized 1:1:1 to receive ONC201 at one of two dosing frequencies or placebo. Participants will be randomized to receive either: (i) 625mg of ONC201 once per week (the Phase 2 dosing regimen), (ii) 625mg twice per week on two consecutive days or (iii) placebo. The study is open to pediatric and adult patients >10kg body weight and the dose will be scaled by body weight for patients weighing less than 52.5kg. Primary endpoints include Overall Survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). OS will be assessed for efficacy at three alpha-allocated timepoints consisting of two interim assessments by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) at 164 events and 246 events, respectively, and a final assessment at 327 events. The final PFS analysis will be performed after 286 events, with progression assessed using response assessment in neuro-oncology-high grade glioma (RANO HGG) and response assessment in neuro-oncology-low grade glioma (RANO-LGG) criteria by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints include corticosteroid response, performance status response, change from baseline in quality of life 
(QoL) assessments and change from baseline in neurologic function as assessed by the Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale. 
Future Regulatory Interactions
The Company's plan is to initiate a submission to regulators for approval upon a positive overall survival analysis at either of the interim or the final overall survival analyses. The first submission for marketing authorization will likely be initiated in the US with submissions outside the US to follow. In addition, in the event the result of the progression free survival analysis is positive, we would discuss the potential for submission and approval of ONC201 with the regulatory authorities based on this data. The Company plans to engage the US FDA on the need for a companion diagnostic for ONC201 as early as this year. 
2022 Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) Conference

The SNO conference featured two external presentations that reported longer survival for patients with glioma who received ONC201 compared to patients with glioma who received alternative therapies. One of these presentations, from an academic group led by researchers at the University of Michigan, examined clinical trials and institutional experiences in the United States and Europe for patients who received ONC201. These researchers concluded that patients who received ONC201, either prior to or after disease progression, showed superior outcomes in terms of OS when compared to patients who never received ONC201. For patients who received ONC201 prior to disease progression, the same treatment setting being evaluated in the Phase 3 ACTION study, the median OS was 26.3 months (n=35). This was compared to 12 months for patients who did not receive ONC201 (n=274, p<0.0001). In the recurrent setting, patients treated with ONC201 (n=37) had a median overall survival of 16.2 months compared to 8.1 months for those not treated with ONC201 (n=99, p=0.05). The researchers concluded that ONC201 efficacy was enriched in patients treated prior to recurrence.
Separately, a poster presentation at SNO from xCures evaluated real world outcomes and treatment patterns among patients with Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG), concluding that patients who received ONC201 survived longer than patients who were not treated with ONC201.
Natural Disease History Study
In addition, in December 2022, the Company reported data from its sponsored Natural Disease History study. The findings of this study support the poor prognosis for recurrent H3 K27M-mutant glioma patients. The study gathered data across eleven sites. The analysis was divided into two separate cohorts.
•Overall Survival Cohort. In relapsed patients who did not receive ONC201, the median overall survival following first disease progression was 5.1 months. This is in contrast to the previously reported ONC201 Phase 2 data set which showed a median OS of 13.7 months from the start of ONC201 treatment following disease progression. Rates of survival at 12 (57% (95% CI: 41 - 70%)) and 24 months (35% (95% CI: 21 - 49%)) in the ONC201 Phase 2 analysis were approximately 2 - 3 times the rates observed in this analysis of patients who did not receive ONC201 (survival at 12 (24% (95% CI: 12-38%)) and 24 months (11% (95% CI: 3.3-24.2))). 
•Objective Response Cohort. The Company also evaluated objective response by RANO-HGG criteria in patients who received therapies other than ONC201 but met similar selection criteria used for the Phase 2 analysis of ONC201 designed to isolate single agent responses in the recurrent setting. In the two patients who were evaluable, neither achieved an objective response. The low number of patients who qualified was primarily due to the high prevalence of ONC201, bevacizumab and/or radiotherapy use following relapse, which would confound an objective response determination. 
Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) of ONC201 Patient Data 
The ONC201 Phase 2 Efficacy Analysis by BICR in recurrent H3 K27M-mutant DMG demonstrated a 30% best overall response rate by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria for high grade glioma (RANO-HGG) and/or low grade glioma (LGG). This data was based on strict criteria to ensure responses were attributable to a single agent. Each response required imaging and clinical criteria and was subject to a dual reader BICR. 
RANO-HGG
As shown in the following waterfall plot, the RANO-HGG that quantitatively evaluates neuroimaging with contrast enhancement assessed by dual reader BICR with adjudication determined:
•Overall response rate (ORR) to be 20.0% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 10.0 - 34%); including one complete response
•Disease control rate to be 40% (95% CI: 26 - 55%)
RANO-LGG
As shown in the following waterfall plot, the RANO-LGG that quantitatively evaluates neuroimaging without contrast enhancement assessed by dual reader BICR with adjudication determined: 
•ORR to be 26% (95% CI: 15 - 40%) 
•Disease control rate to be 42% (95% CI: 28 - 57%)
The proportion of patients achieving either a RANO-HGG and/or a RANO-LGG response was 30% (95% CI: 17.9 - 44.6%).
Among evaluable patients (those receiving at least 4mg of dexamethasone daily at baseline), 46.7% achieved at least a 50% confirmed reduction in corticosteroid dose. Among evaluable patients (those with a baseline performance status (KPS/LPS) score of 80 or lower), 20.6% achieved a confirmed improvement, indicative of improved quality of life.
Overall survival:
•12 months: 57% (95% CI: 41 - 70%)
•24 months: 35% (95% CI: 21 - 49%)
The cohort was comprised of the first 50 patients enrolled across five ONC201 clinical protocols, who met specific criteria designed to isolate the tumor response from ONC201 monotherapy, based on feedback from the FDA. These patients were two years of age or older, had measurable diffuse midline glioma with the H3 K27M-mutation, and had evidence of disease progression following prior therapy with radiation completed at least 90 days prior to enrollment. 
One serious adverse event, considered to be possibly ONC201-related by the investigator and unlikely to be ONC201-related by the sponsor, was identified. Full safety data collection and analysis for this cohort is ongoing. Prior safety review of ONC201 identified the most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) as nausea/vomiting, fatigue and decreased lymphocyte counts. 
Fast Track Designation by FDA
The FDA has granted ONC201 Fast Track Designation for the treatment of adult recurrent H3 K27M-mutant high-grade glioma, Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for treatment of H3 K27M-mutant glioma, and Orphan Drug Designations for the treatment of glioblastoma and for the treatment of malignant glioma.
ONC201 in Other Cancers
In addition to clinical trials in glioma, ONC201 has been evaluated in an open label Phase 2 investigator-initiated study that treated 30 patients at the Cleveland Clinic with rare neuroendocrine tumors. Paraganglioma patients were enrolled in two cohorts initiating ONC201 either once or twice weekly. A third cohort included patients with other neuroendocrine tumors, including desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), dosed weekly with ONC201. The primary endpoint was radiographic response as measured by RECIST criteria. Investigator-assessed data from this study were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in 2021 and published in the journal Clinical Cancer Research in 2022.
In the cohort of recurrent metastatic paraganglioma patients receiving ONC201 monotherapy once weekly, 50% (5/10) of patients exhibited a partial response (PR) and two additional patients had stable disease (SD) that lasted longer than three months. Five of the 10 patients in this cohort were treated longer than one year. Among the cohort of paraganglioma patients receiving ONC201 twice weekly 1 PR and 7 SD were observed; this cohort includes four of eight patients who crossed over from the weekly dosing cohort. The third cohort of other neuroendocrine tumors included one PR (DSRCT) and two SD (DSRCT; neuroblastoma) that lasted longer than three months. Importantly, across all cohorts there was no decline in Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) at week 12 for 93% of patients (28/30) and no dose modification due to treatment-related adverse events.
ONC206
ONC206 is an imipridone, DRD2 antagonist and ClpP agonist that has demonstrated enhanced non-competitive DRD2 antagonism relative to ONC201 in preclinical studies and additionally showed disruption of DRD2 homodimers. ONC206 exhibits nanomolar potency and showed anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of difficult-to-treat neuroendocrine tumors, endometrial cancer and high-grade gliomas. In vitro, ONC206 has affected some of the same downstream pathways as ONC201, including activation of the integrated stress response and inhibition of Ras signaling, leading to selective killing of tumor cells.
The first-in-human clinical trial of ONC206 for adults with recurrent primary central nervous system tumors is ongoing at the National Institute of Health (NCT04541082). In addition, the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC), is conducting a dose escalating clinical trial of ONC206 for pediatric patients with central nervous system tumors. 
In March 2023, the Company reported a finding of an investigator- assessed response in a recurrent glioblastoma patient without the H3K27M-mutation who received monotherapy ONC206 has emerged during dose escalation in the PNOC study. 
ONC212
ONC212 is an imipridone, investigational agonist of the orphan GPCR tumor suppressor GPR132, as well as ClpP. Similar to the potential downstream effects of ONC201 and ONC206, in vitro studies of ONC212 demonstrate activation of integrated stress response, inhibition of Ras signaling and selective killing of tumor cells. ONC212 showed broad-spectrum activity across both solid tumors and hematological malignancies, including ONC201-refractory pancreatic cancer and leukemias that exhibit high GPR132 and/or ClpP expression.
Initial IND-enabling studies with ONC212 have been completed and are being evaluated to determine next steps, including potentially first-in-human studies. 
CMX521
CMX521 is a nucleoside analog antiviral drug candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. CMX521 is not mutagenic, clastogenic, or associated with mitochondrial toxicity. In addition, oral CMX521 demonstrated a favorable profile in GLP toxicology studies and was well-tolerated up to 2,400 mg in a healthy volunteer Phase 1 study for a different indication.
Pursuant to a 2006 agreement between the Company and The Regents of the University of Michigan (UM), the Company obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to UM’s patent rights in certain inventions related to certain compounds originally synthesized at UM, including CMX521. Under the license agreement, the Company is permitted to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products utilizing the UM Patent Rights, and to sublicense such rights subject to certain sublicensing fees and royalty payments. 
Rapidly Emerging Antiviral Drug Development Initiative (READDI)
The Company is currently working with READDI at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) which is the co-recipient of a grant for approximately $1.7 million from the state of North Carolina for the development of CMX521 as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2. READDI is a global public-private partnership founded at UNC by the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, UNC School of Medicine, Gilling School of Global Public Health, Eshelman Institute for Innovation and the Structural Genomics Consortium. The grant will fund prodrug synthesis and animal studies to optimize delivery of CMX521 to the lungs via a convenient oral formulation. In addition, UNC will conduct COVID-19 disease mouse efficacy models and evaluate lung delivery of the active antiviral.
Chimerix Antiviral Chemical Library
The Chimerix Chemical Library contains over 10,000 heterocyclic ring systems and nucleosides. This library includes approximately 3,500 nucleoside analog compounds, most of which are candidates for lipid conjugation. In a collaboration with the scientists at UNC, we continue to evaluate our library of antiviral molecules to identify candidates that may have the potential to accelerate pandemic preparedness or response to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. COVID-19) or other potential future pandemics. 
TEMBEXA (brincidofovir, BCV)
TEMBEXA is a lipid conjugate which acts via inhibition of viral DNA synthesis that is a medical countermeasure for smallpox. On June 4, 2021, the FDA granted TEMBEXA approval for the treatment of smallpox. TEMBEXA is available in tablets and oral suspension. It is approved for adult and pediatric patients, including neonates. TEMBEXA was developed as a medical countermeasure for the treatment of smallpox under a collaboration with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). 
On August 26, 2022, the Company entered into a procurement contract (the BARDA Agreement) with BARDA for the delivery of up to 1.7 million treatment courses of tablet and suspension formulations of TEMBEXA® to the U.S. government. The BARDA Agreement consists of a five-year base period of performance and a total contract period of performance (base period plus option exercises) of up to ten years, if necessary. 
On September 26, 2022, the Company sold its exclusive worldwide rights to brincidofovir, including TEMBEXA® and specified related assets (the Asset Sale) to Emergent. Upon closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement for the Asset Sale, the Company received $238 million upfront and could receive additional milestone payment of up to $136.5 million to be paid contingent upon the execution of optional future procurement awards from BARDA and other development milestones. The Company may also earn a 20% royalty on future gross profit of TEMBEXA in the United States associated with volumes above 1.7 million treatment courses of therapy during the exclusivity period of TEMBEXA. The agreement also allows the Company to earn a 15% royalty on all gross profit associated with TEMBEXA sales outside of the United States during the exclusivity period of TEMBEXA on a market-to-market basis.
The Company continues to provide operational support to Emergent in furtherance of its obligations under both the Asset Purchase Agreement (and related agreements) and the BARDA Agreement. The BARDA Agreement was novated to Emergent in December 2022.
Our Strategy
The principal components of our business strategy are to:
•Successfully execute the randomized controlled Phase 3 ACTION study.  ONC201 is currently being developed for H3 K27M-mutant diffuse glioma. In November 2022 we initiated ACTION, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 3 international trial for newly diagnosed patients with H3 K27M-mutant diffuse glioma shortly following radiation with targeted enrollment of approximately 450 patients randomized 1:1:1 to receive ONC201 at one of two dosing frequencies or placebo. Available Phase 2 data demonstrate durable responses (as measured by RANO) in recurrent H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma associated with other forms of clinical benefit. The Phase 2 program was designed to isolate single agent activity in difficult treatment settings. Independent and company sponsored natural disease history studies support a potential survival advantage. The genetically selected patient population limits patient heterogeneity. In the 
current neuro-oncology community there exists high awareness of ONC201 which we believe will aid in the enrollment of this study. 
•Upon approval, successfully commercialize ONC201.  Patients with H3 K27M mutant glioma are faced with a terminal disease with no known effective therapeutic options beyond radiation. In the current neuro-oncology community there exists high awareness of ONC201 which we believe will aid in the potential commercialization. The global potential annual revenue of ONC201 for its first indication exceeds ~$750 million, based on our internal estimates. 
•Maintain corporate capability and financial flexibility. Our leadership team has successfully executed large-scale clinical studies and regulatory approvals of investigational agents. We intend to continue to leverage external capital to develop our early-stage pipeline consisting of ONC206, ONC212 and derivatives of CMX521. 
•Seek opportunities to in-license other development programs. We continue to review transactions designed to build our product candidate pipeline, including, but not limited to, merger or acquisition transactions, or the license, purchase or sale of specific assets, in addition to other potential actions aimed at maximizing stockholder value. There can be no assurance that this review will result in the identification or consummation of any additional transaction.
Significant Agreements
Emergent Biodefense Operations Lansing LLC
On September 26, 2022, the Company completed the Asset Sale to Emergent of the Company’s exclusive worldwide rights to brincidofovir, including TEMBEXA® and specified related assets (the Asset Sale). Emergent paid the Company an upfront cash payment of approximately $238 million upon the closing of the Asset Sale. In addition, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company is eligible to receive from Emergent: (i) up to an aggregate of approximately $124 million in milestone payments payable upon the exercise of the options under the BARDA Agreement for the delivery of up to 1.7 million treatment courses of tablet and suspension formulations of TEMBEXA to the U.S. government; (ii) royalty payments equal to 15% of the gross profits from the sales of TEMBEXA made outside of the United States; (iii) royalty payments equal to 20% of the gross profits from the sales of TEMBEXA made in the United States in excess of 1.7 million treatment courses; and (iv) up to an additional $12.5 million upon the achievement of certain other developmental milestones. The effects of recording certain adjustments associated with contingent consideration related to TEMBEXA have been excluded as the Company has made a policy election to account for these amounts when the contingency has been resolved in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 450, Contingencies.
The Company continues to provide operational support to Emergent in furtherance of its obligations under both the Asset Purchase Agreement (and related agreements) and the BARDA Agreement. The BARDA Agreement was novated to Emergent LLC in December 2022. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company recognized approximately $0.5 million of contract revenue for support provided for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.
The sale of TEMBEXA constitutes a significant disposition of a business, however, the Company determined the disposition does not represent a strategic shift, and accordingly, the Company has not accounted for the disposition as a discontinued operation. The Company recorded a $229.7 million net gain on sale of business in other income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.
2022 BARDA Procurement and Development Contract
On August 26, 2022, the Company entered into a procurement contract (the BARDA Agreement) with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the delivery of up to 1.7 million treatment courses of tablet and suspension formulations of TEMBEXA® to the U.S. government. The BARDA Agreement consists of a five-year base period of performance and a total contract period of performance (base period plus option exercises) of up to ten years (if necessary). Under the terms of the BARDA Agreement, the base period activities are valued at approximately $127 million, consisting of an initial shipment of treatment courses of TEMBEXA to be procured and shipped to the U.S. Government for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $115 million, and reimbursement for certain post-marketing activities of approximately $12 million. The options under the BARDA Agreement are valued at approximately $553 million (if all such options are exercised during the 10-year contract period), which consists of options to purchase up to an additional 1.381 million treatment courses of TEMBEXA for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $551 million and funding for certain post-marketing activities of approximately $2 million. 
In connection with the sale of the TEMBEXA franchise to Emergent, the BARDA Agreement was novated to Emergent in December 2022. In accordance with federal regulations, the terms of the novation agreement require that the company 
guarantee the performance of all obligations transferred to Emergent should Emergent not have the ability to deliver on the terms of the BARDA Agreement. In this instance BARDA may request that we perform the obligations in place of Emergent. 
TEMBEXA International Supply Agreements
In June 2022, the Company entered into a Supply Agreement (the Supply Agreement) with a third-party outside of North America (the Purchaser), pursuant to which the Company was responsible for supplying to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser was responsible for purchasing from the Company, TEMBEXA treatment courses for use in a jurisdiction outside of the United States. Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, the Purchaser paid the Company an aggregate purchase price of approximately $9.3 million, in two equal installments in June 2022 and July 2022. The Company recognized $9.3 million of procurement revenue under the Supply Agreement for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.
Additionally, in June 2022, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) awarded a Contract (the PHAC Contract) to the Company, pursuant to which PHAC agreed to purchase up to approximately $25.3 million (CAD $33.0 million) of TEMBEXA treatment courses for use in Canada. Substantially all of the procurement was delivered and accepted by PHAC in July 2022, completing the performance obligation for those shipments and resulting in $22.6 million of procurement revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. PHAC assigned the PHAC Contract to Emergent in November 2022. The remaining deliveries of treatment courses were delivered by Emergent and are subject to the royalty terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement applicable to gross profits outside the United States. The Company recognized approximately $0.4 million of royalty revenue in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.
Merger Agreement with Oncoceutics 
On January 7, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire Oncoceutics, a privately-held, clinical-stage biotechnology company developing imipridones, a novel potential class of compounds. As consideration for the acquisition, we (a) paid an upfront cash payment of approximately $25.0 million, (b) issued an aggregate of 8,723,769 shares of our common stock, (c) made an additional cash payment of $14.0 million upon the one year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition, and (d) agreed to make contingent payments up to an aggregate of $360.0 million based on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercialization events, as well as additional tiered royalty payments based upon combined future net sales of ONC201 and ONC206 products of 15% up to $750 million in annual revenue and 20% above $750 million in annual revenue, subject to certain reductions, and a contingent payment in the event we receive any proceeds from the sale of a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher based on the Oncoceutics products. Pursuant to the merger agreement we have certain diligence obligations with respect to further development and commercialization of the Oncoceutics product candidates.
Ohara Pharmaceutical Co.
In 2019, Oncoceutics entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with Ohara Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. for ONC201 in Japan. We are entitled to receive up to $2.5 million in nonrefundable regulatory milestone payments, and to tiered royalties based on the aggregate annual net sales of all products, as defined in the agreement, in Japan. 
China Resources Sanjiu Medical & Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (CR Sanjiu)
In December 2020, Oncoceutics entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement for ONC201 with China Resources Sanjiu Medical & Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (CR Sanjiu). Oncoceutics granted CR Sanjiu an exclusive royalty bearing license to develop and commercialize ONC201 in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (CR Sanjiu Territory). We are entitled to receive up to $5.0 million in nonrefundable regulatory milestone payments, and to tiered royalties based on the aggregate annual net sales of all licensed products, as defined in the agreement, in the CR Sanjiu Territory. 
Commercial Operations
If ONC201 is approved for H3 K27M-mutant glioma, we plan to commercialize ONC201 in the United States. We anticipate that commercialization would entail a relatively small commercial infrastructure, which may include a contract sales force, partner sales force, or an internally developed commercial organization. 
Outside of the United States, subject to obtaining necessary marketing approvals, we may seek to commercialize ONC201 ourselves or through distribution or other collaboration arrangements. If we elect to develop ONC201 for other indications, we will plan to do so selectively either on our own or by establishing alliances with one or more pharmaceutical company collaborators, depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the related development costs, reimbursement complexities and our available resources.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our therapeutic experience, scientific and commercial knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we will face competition from large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and other emerging technologies.
We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of ONC201 and our other product candidates are the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile and the risk-benefit trade-off compared to alternative therapies or procedures. Securing market access and reimbursement will be an important element of product uptake and market penetration. Our commercial opportunity could be negatively impacted if our competitors develop or market products or other technologies that are more effective, better tolerated, safer, more convenient or have greater market access than ONC201 or any product candidate, or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do. In addition, our ability to compete will be affected by the availability of generic products.
ONC201 is the most clinically advanced program in the industry for potentially treating tumors which harbor the H3 K27M mutation. If approved, treatment with ONC201 is expected to be targeted to patients whose tumor harbors the H3 K27M mutation. There are currently no commercially available treatments that target the H3 K27M mutant patient population. 
If approved, ONC201 could compete with a number of existing products, new products in development and possible combination therapies used for brain cancers including generic drugs such as chemotherapy, targeted agents, immunotherapies, and other therapies. Select products that are currently used, or being developed for use, to treat brain cancers include, but are not limited to:
•Systemic therapies approved to treat brain cancer: temozolomide, lomustine, carmustine, everolimus, and bevacizumab; 
•Tumor-treating fields such as Optune®; and
•Other investigational agents for the treatment of brain cancer: immunotherapies (CAR-T, durvalumab, VBI-1901, etc), viral therapies (DCVax-L, etc.), targeted agents (panobinostat, paxalisib, MDNA55), and other therapies.
Changes in the health care system may limit our ability to price ONC201 and our other product candidates at a level that would allow recovery of our research and development costs and may impede our ability to generate or maintain a profit.
We believe that ONC201 has potential benefits over existing and potential competitive products, and as a result, we believe that our products should be well positioned to gain adoption if we obtain the required regulatory approvals. However, even with those benefits, we may not be able to make promotional claims that these products are superior to competing products without conducting additional studies, which delivers differentiated data. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates.”
Our Intellectual Property 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies we believe are important to our business, including by seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain licenses to our intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
Imipridone Patent Portfolio
At February 15, 2023, our worldwide imipridone patent portfolio included:
•416 patents or patent applications related to imipridones that we have acquired rights to through our merger with Oncoceutics, Inc. (owned or in-licensed by Oncoceutics);
•This includes 213 US and foreign issued patents and 65 pending US and foreign applications related to ONC201; and
•Patent protection for ONC201's lead indication is expected to extend into 2037 in the U.S., with the potential for 2042 in the U.S. in the event of full patent term restoration.
Antiviral Patent Portfolio
At February 10, 2023, our worldwide antiviral patent portfolio included:
•28 patents or patent applications that we own or have in-licensed from academic institutions, related to antivirals, which represented a decrease[1] over the number of patents in our patent portfolio at the end of fiscal year 2021;
•This includes 17 US and foreign exclusively and jointly owned patents and 11 US and foreign applications related to antivirals. Granted European patents are counted as one patent and have been validated throughout Europe;
•Five jointly-owned US and foreign patents and seven jointly-owned US patent applications related to our agreement with UM regarding our proprietary Chemical Library; and
•One US patent, one US patent application, one pending PCT application, and one European patent application exclusively owned by Chimerix directed to a morphic form of a compound from the Chemical Library. 
Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our portfolio, enhancing our freedom of action to exclusively sell our products, upon appropriate regulatory approvals, in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is itself essential to the conduct of our business as a whole.
We also seek to expand our intellectual property portfolio through licensing intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have granted, and will continue to grant to others, licenses under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest.
Manufacturing 
We do not own or operate, and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. In the past, we have relied on third-party manufacturers for supply of our product candidates. 
We expect that in the future we will rely on such manufacturers for supply of drug substance and drug product that will be used in clinical trials of ONC201, our expanded access program for ONC201 and other clinical trials as well as for commercial purposes should ONC201 be approved. When produced on a commercial scale, we expect that cost-of-goods-sold relating to the imipridone class of assets will generally be in-line with that of other targeted oncology therapies.
The manufacturing processes for ONC201 drug substance and drug product are relatively straight-forward and generally in-line with other small molecule pharmaceutical compounds in terms of cost and complexity. The processes are robust and reproducible and do not require dedicated reactors or specialized equipment. The drug substance process uses common synthetic chemistry and readily available materials, including off-the-shelf and made-to-order starting materials, and is readily transferable. The drug product process uses common excipients and readily available materials, and is also readily transferable.
Manufacturers of drug components must meet certain FDA qualifications with respect to manufacturing standards. At present, we have qualified only one firm as a supplier of drug substance. We continually assess our manufacturing needs and may seek to engage additional qualified vendors as circumstances dictate. To ensure continuity in our supply chain, we plan to establish supply arrangements with alternative suppliers for certain portions of our supply chain, as appropriate.
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our systems and contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and this is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program. We have personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience and strong project management discipline to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and government authorities of member states of the EU and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring 
and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Any product candidate that we develop must be approved by the FDA or EMA before it may be legally marketed in the United States or EU and in other countries by the responsible national regulatory agency before it may be legally marketed.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, FDA approval process or after FDA approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, debarment, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action, whether before or after the FDA approval process, could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices (GLP), or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as current good clinical practices (GCPs), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice standards (cGMP), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and FDA review of the NDA.
The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain.
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy subjects or affected patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Patients not meeting protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria may be considered for our expanded access program under the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the good clinical practices requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IRB), at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1.   The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•Phase 2.   The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•Phase 3.   Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to determine if they are substantially complete before it accepts them for filing; this initial review period prior to accepting the NDA for filing is two months in duration. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has 10 months from the date of accepting the NDA for filing in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission without prior agreement reached at a pre-submission meeting.
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with 
cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the drug approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements. If major issues with trial conduct are identified at a site, data collected from that site can be determined to be unacceptable for supporting the application. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information.
The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
U.S. Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of a product for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if a drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a number of programs that are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products for serious conditions that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and/or Priority Review designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. 
Breakthrough Therapy designation is for a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. 
Unique to Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy products, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing approval, including Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy programs, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy for the approved indication. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-review of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track, Breakthrough, and Priority Review designations and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any drug products for which we or our strategic alliance partners receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising agreements include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Our strategic alliance partners may also utilize third parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such strategic alliance partner. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
U.S. Health Care Laws
Our operations may be subject to federal and state health care laws and regulations including, without limitation: anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, patient data privacy and security laws, and health care professional payment transparency laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, as well as contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Reimbursement / Health Reform 
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third-party reimbursement. Third-party payers include government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, including prescription drugs. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of 
newly approved prescription drugs and other healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payers. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow the sale of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved on a competitive and profitable basis.
There have been, and we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals and enacted legislation to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. 
For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, ACA), has had a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA was enacted in an effort to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. Among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. However, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. The ACA may be subject to additional judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact ACA.
There has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices, including several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, increase drug pricing transparency, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, review relationships between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program drug reimbursement methodologies. At the federal level, for example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has recently been enacted in an effort to control drug pricing for drugs that are covered by Medicare. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Such reform efforts are likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their respective national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products for which we receive marketing approval. Historically, the price structures for products launched in the EU do not follow those of the United States and tend to be significantly lower.
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we and our strategic alliance partners will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we or our collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application (CTA), must be submitted. 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we or our strategic alliance partners must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA or a Biologics License Application in the United States is similar to the application dossier (eCTD) required in the EU.
For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we or our strategic alliance partners fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
EU Review and Approval Process
In the EU, there are two main routes for authorizing the marketing of medicines, a centralized route and a national route. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain types of medicinal products which are produced by biotechnology processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and for those which are designated as orphan medicinal products. Besides the products falling under the mandatory scope, the centralized procedure is also optional for medicinal products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation i.e. new active substances or other medicinal products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, that contain an active substance not authorized in the European Union before May 20, 2004 or for which a centralized procedure would be in the interest of patients.
Under the centralized authorization procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing-authorization application to the EMA. EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) carries out a scientific assessment of the application and makes a recommendation to the European Commission whether the medicine should be marketed or not. If authorization is granted by the European Commission, the centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU Member States as well as in the European Economic Area (EEA) countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. 
Additionally, medicines that belong to at least one of the below categories may be granted a conditional market authorization (CMA). 
A CMA may be granted if: (1) the CHMP finds that the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data, (3) the unmet medical needs will be fulfilled, and (4) the benefit to public health of the medicinal product’s immediate availability on the market outweighs the risks due to need for further data.
CMAs are valid for one year and can be renewed annually. The CMA holder will be required to complete specific obligations (to complete ongoing or new studies, and in some cases additional activities) with a view to providing comprehensive data confirming that the benefit-risk balance is positive. Once comprehensive data on the product have been obtained, the CMA may be converted into a full marketing authorization (not subject to specific obligations). Initially, this is valid for five years, but can be renewed for unlimited validity.
Orphan Designation in the EU
In order to qualify for Orphan Designation, a medicine must meet the following criteria:
•it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating;
•the prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than five in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and
•no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
EMA is responsible for reviewing applications from sponsors for orphan designation. The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), through its network of experts, examines applications for Orphan Designation and issues an opinion to EMA. The evaluation process takes approximately of 90 days from validation. Once EMA receives COMP’s opinion, EMA sends it to the European Commission, which is responsible for granting the Orphan Designation. 
At the time a sponsor of a marketing application files for marketing authorization for a medicine that has received Orphan Designation, the sponsor must also submit a report on the maintenance of the Orphan Designation in parallel. EMA uses this report to determine whether the medicine can maintain its status as an orphan medicine and benefit from the extended market exclusivity applicable to orphan products. Market exclusivity is linked to the maintenance of the Orphan Designation when the medicine receives a marketing authorization for the indication concerned.
If it is determined that a medicine still meets the criteria for Orphan Designation at the time of marketing approval, that medicine may benefit from a period of ten years market exclusivity in the EU. This incentive is intended to protect orphan medicines from market competition with similar medicines with similar indications once they are approved, and fundamentally to encourage the development of medicines for rare diseases.
The applicant is obliged to submit an annual report to the EMA every year after their medicine has been granted orphan designation. The annual report needs to provide information on the status of the development of the medicine, such as a review of ongoing clinical studies, a description of the investigation plan for the coming year and any anticipated or current problems in the process, difficulties in testing and potential changes that may have an impact on the medicine’s orphan designation. 
The European Commission is responsible for granting market exclusivity for orphan medicines. Market exclusivity is linked to each specific Orphan Designation for which a marketing authorization has been granted. 
The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for medicines that also have complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan (PIP). Each orphan designation for a product linked to a separate orphan condition is eligible for a two-year extension if this is accounted for in the PIP. The extension is granted by the European Commission based on the positive compliance check from the Pediatric Committee and opinion from the CHMP.

Employee Engagement, Talent Development & Benefits. We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, flexible working arrangements, including work-from-home arrangements, retirement planning and paid time off.
