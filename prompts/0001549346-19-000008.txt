 Item 1.    Business.
Overview
Shutterstock is a global technology company offering a creative platform, which provides high-quality digital content, tools and services to creative professionals. Our platform brings together users and contributors of content by providing readily-searchable content that our customers pay to license and by compensating contributors as their content is licensed. 
The digital content licensed by our customers include: (a) imagery, consisting of licensed photographs, vectors, illustrations and video clips, which is used in visual communications, such as websites, digital and print marketing materials, corporate communications, books, publications and video content; and (b) music, consisting of high-quality music tracks and sound effects, which is often used to complement digital imagery. For customers seeking specialized solutions, we also create custom, on-brand content through our platform by matching our global contributor network against the unique needs of our customers. This model allows us to offer customers a fast and scalable way to produce cost-effective content that is in line with the visual footprint of their brand. The processes we maintain to properly license content and the indemnification protections we provide, allow individuals and businesses of all sizes, including media agencies, publishers, production companies and creative service providers, to enter into licenses with the confidence to utilize such content for their unique commercial or editorial needs. We also offered digital asset management services through Webdam, our cloud-based digital asset management business, which we sold in February 2018. 
We believe that our licensing model and creative platform drive a high volume of download activity that in turn provides a high volume of search, download and other customer behavioral data that enables us to continuously improve the quality and accuracy of our proprietary search algorithms, including keyword and similar image identification, and encourages the creation and contribution of new content to meet our customers’ needs. We enable users to search and discover content to meet their unique needs by searching our collection and previewing our content at no cost prior to licensing.
We also leverage, to the greatest extent possible, the global nature of our user interfaces and marketing efforts, including local languages, currencies and payment methods, and our effective use of current and emerging technology and marketing channels to attract and retain customers and contributors. We believe that we benefit from a network effect between customers and contributors: as we have grown, our broadening audience of paying users has attracted more content from contributors, and the increasing selection of high-quality content has in turn helped to attract more customers to our sites. The success of this network effect is facilitated by the trust that users place in Shutterstock to maintain the quality and integrity of our branded marketplace, and our commitment to seamless integration into users’ creative workflows.
Our Products
We offer licenses for a variety of content types, including current, archival and commissioned photographs, illustrations, vector art, video clips and music tracks. Generally, we provide our content under a royalty-free non-exclusive license and each piece of content available for license has been vetted by a team of reviewers to ensure that it meets our standards of quality and can be appropriately licensed for commercial or editorial use. We provide several offerings across our creative platform, as follows:

• | Shutterstock - Shutterstock is our flagship brand and the majority of our revenue is generated through shutterstock.com. We continuously work to expand the collection of photographs, vectors, illustrations and video clips available on shutterstock.com to further establish Shutterstock as a top source of high-quality digital imagery for multimedia producers world-wide.


• | Bigstock - Bigstock maintains a separate, extensive library of photographs, vectors, illustrations and video clips that is specifically curated to meet the needs of independent creators and others seeking to incorporate cost-effective digital imagery into their projects.


• | Offset - For high-impact use cases that require extraordinary imagery, our Offset brand provides authentic and exceptional imagery, featuring work from top assignment photographers and illustrators from around the world, in addition to work from established and respected collections such as National Geographic®. Every image in the collection is hand-selected, chosen for its artistic distinction and narrative quality, and is curated into specific categories such as lifestyle, food, travel and fashion.


• | Shutterstock Select - In November 2018, we launched Shutterstock Select, a premium collection of royalty-free video content available on shutterstock.com. This diverse collection of video clips includes exclusive content widely ranging from everyday moments to blockbuster action scenes, all captured by industry professionals using cinema-grade cameras and selected by our expert curators.

• | Shutterstock Custom - Shutterstock Custom is a complementary offering on Shutterstock’s creative platform that fulfills marketers’ need to scale unique branded content including photos, video clips, GIFs, cinemagraphs and 360° video content. Shutterstock Custom is powered by the proprietary technology that we gained through our acquisition of Flashstock Technology, Inc. (“Flashstock”) in 2017, and which we expect to grow in the future as we continue to seek expansion in the market for custom content creation.


• | Shutterstock Editorial - Shutterstock Editorial includes Rex Features and provides editorial imagery, such as entertainment, sports and news images, to a broad range of customers from independent bloggers to traditional media outlets by providing a real-time feed of editorial content and an extensive archive of editorial images. We have entered into distribution agreements with a number of leading editorial image agencies and industry partners including exclusive distribution agreements with several third-party organizations.


• | Shutterstock Music - Shutterstock Music provides thousands of handpicked audio tracks and sound effects at affordable prices, giving businesses, marketers, producers and filmmakers access to the audio content they need to bring their ideas to life. Shutterstock Music, along with the PremiumBeat brand, are curated royalty-free music service offerings that allow access to a full collection of exclusive, high-quality tracks and enables users to search handpicked production music from the world’s leading composers.

In addition to our product offerings, we also provide the following tools to enhance our customers’ workflow and project management needs as well as to enable efficient search capabilities:

• | Superior search - We obtain a high volume of data generated from user searches and content downloads, which enables us to continuously improve our search algorithms. Our behavioral and keyword data, along with our investments in technology and our experience in developing search algorithms, enhance our users’ search experience by increasing the chances that our users find the content they require in a timely and efficient manner.


• | Application programming interface (API) - We maintain an API driven infrastructure, enabling integration of our content platform with various other software tools and services, such as Facebook Ads, IBM Watson® Content Hub, Google Ads and Wix, which allow businesses to gain access to our content without leaving their platform. In addition, we have developed plug-ins that our customers can use to seamlessly access our content directly from Adobe Creative Cloud® desktop applications, Google SlidesTM, Apple’s Final Cut Pro® X video editing application and several Microsoft applications.


• | Showcase - Shutterstock Showcase (www.shutterstock.com/showcase) features deep learning-powered search tools based on our most innovative artificial intelligence technology designed to help customers find the content they need fast.


▪ | Reveal is a Google ChromeTM browser extension allowing users to select any image online and find a similar photo, vector or illustration within Shutterstock’s collection.


▪ | Copy Space is based on Shutterstock’s custom-built computer vision technology enabling users to specifically search for images that have space for text and then select where and how much copy space is needed.


▪ | Refine enables users, from the first page of search results, to select those images most similar to what they are looking for, and Shutterstock's technology will surface other similar images.


▪ | Composition Search enables users to add keywords to a canvas to search for a specific layout of objects within an image.


• | Editor and Editor Pro - Shutterstock Editor and Editor Pro are feature-filled cloud-based workflow tools that provide a robust solution for creative professionals to quickly size, edit and enhance images for immediate use in presentations, social media posts or advertisements. These tools are designed to simplify the process of editing Shutterstock’s millions of photos and illustrations into compelling presentations.

Sales and Distribution Channels
Our online platform provides a freely searchable collection of digital content that our users can pay to license, download and incorporate into their work. We encourage all our customers to take advantage of our creative platform’s comprehensive search capabilities, our credit card-based payment options and the immediate digital delivery of licensed content. We strive to offer simple, transparent purchase options designed to cater to customers’ specific needs. We believe the ability to search for, select, license, download and customize content on our creative platform offers our users a streamlined workflow, convenience and speed, and enables us to achieve greater economies of scale. We also have contractual arrangements with third-party resellers and affiliates to license digital content to customers in markets where we do not have a significant sales and marketing presence. Certain third-party resellers and affiliates sell our products directly to end-users and remit amounts to us based on the type of product sold.
Customer sales are made through the following channels:

• | E-commerce: The majority of our customers license content directly through our self-service web properties. E-commerce customers have the flexibility to purchase a subscription-based plan that is paid on a monthly or annual basis or to license content on a transactional basis. These customers generally license content under our standard or enhanced licenses, with additional licensing options available to meet customers’ individual needs. E-commerce customers typically pay the full amount of the purchase price in advance or at the time of license, generally with a credit card, which has historically resulted in favorable timing of cash flows relative to the time that revenue is recognized and contributor royalties are earned and paid.


• | Enterprise: Our base of enterprise customers is mainly composed of creative professionals and large organizations with unique content, licensing and workflow needs. As our enterprise customer base has grown, the number of unique offerings has also grown, as we continue to address individual business needs. Customers of this size benefit from communication with our dedicated sales, service and research teams which provide a number of tailored enhancements to their creative workflows including non-standard licensing rights, multi-seat access, ability to pay on credit terms, multi-brand licensing packages, increased indemnification protection and content licensed for use-cases outside of those available on our e-commerce platform. We continue to focus on our localization and enterprise expansion strategy and are investing resources in cultivating key international markets which we believe have significant growth potential and strategic importance.


• | Other: Our other sales channel includes revenue from Webdam’s digital asset management offerings which were made available through annual software-as-a-service subscription plans. On February 26, 2018, we completed a sale transaction of our digital asset management business (the “Sale of Webdam”) for an aggregate purchase price of $49.1 million.

Revenues generated from each of the sales channels are as follows (in thousands):

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | 2014
E-Commerce | $ | 365,730 | | | $ | 332,376 | | $ | 318,916 | $ | 300,051 | $ | 263,455

(1) Effective January 1, 2018 we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”) using the modified retrospective approach. Historical revenue totals reflect those previously reported and have not been restated. The historical presentation of the allocation of revenue by sales channel for the periods prior to January 1, 2018 have been adjusted to conform to current presentation.
Our Customers
We serve a diverse array of customers across a variety of industries, organizational sizes and geographies. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 1.9 million customers in more than 150 countries licensed revenue-generating content, with approximately 37%, 33% and 30% of revenue coming from customers in North America, Europe and the rest of the world, respectively. Our top 25 customers in the aggregate accounted for less than 5% of our revenue in 2018. Our customers are classified among three categories, as follows: 

• | Marketing Professionals and Organizations. Marketing professionals and organizations incorporate licensed content in the work they produce for their organizational or clients’ business communications. Whether providing graphic design, web design, interactive design, advertising, public relations, communications or marketing services,

our marketing professional users range from independent freelancers and internal corporate marketing professionals to the largest global agencies and Fortune 500 companies.

• | Media and Broadcast Companies. Media organizations and professionals incorporate licensed content into their work, which includes digital publications, newspapers, books, magazines, television and film, as well as to market their products effectively. Our media users range from independent bloggers to multi-national publishing, broadcast and production organizations. 


• | Small and Medium-Sized Businesses. Organizations of all sizes utilize creative content for a wide range of internal- and external-use communications such as websites, print and digital advertisements, annual reports, brochures, employee communications, newsletters, email marketing campaigns and other presentations. These organizations range in size and type of organization, from sole proprietors to large not-for-profit organizations. 

Content Contributors and Content Review Process
Our collection of content is provided by a community of contributors from around the world and is vetted by our proprietary technology and specialized team of reviewers to ensure that it meets our standards of quality and licensability. Whether photographers, videographers, illustrators, designers or musicians, our community of more than 650,000 approved contributors as of December 31, 2018 ranges from part-time enthusiasts to full-time professionals, and all of them must meet our robust quality standards. Supplementing the content in our collection and enabled by our acquisition of Flashstock, we launched Shutterstock Custom in 2017, which through our platform, connects business customers with a vast network of contributors from whom to request custom branded imagery to meet their most specific content needs. The content contributed by our five highest-earning contributors was together responsible for less than 3% of downloads in 2018, demonstrating the breadth and depth of our contributor population.
The breadth and quality of our content offerings are critical to our success, and we have created an easy-to-use online account creation process, which we are continually improving, through which we enable contributors to create an account, become verified, submit content, and once approved for submission, upload content onto our platform for licensing. We evaluate submissions based on certain technical and legal criteria to ensure we maintain the quality and integrity of our content library, including whether applicable releases have been obtained, whether third-party intellectual property is excluded and seeking to minimize other technical concerns such as excess noise or focus issues. As of December 31, 2018, over 350 million images and video clips have been submitted from verified contributor accounts. For each content submission that is not approved during the review process, we notify the contributor by email with an explanation why the image was not published, including guidance on our standards and insight into customers’ expectations. We believe that this feedback is valuable to contributors and enhances the quality of future content submissions as well as our customers’ experience.
We use proprietary computer vision technology along with a trained team of reviewers to complete a comprehensive evaluation of all content submissions. Our content review process is highly efficient, and our content review team strives to evaluate and process images and video clips within 24 hours of submission to make them available for license on our sites, while working to continually improve our process to reduce review time.
Contributors are required to add a descriptive title and up to 50 keywords to each image and video clip submitted. We guide our contributors to provide terms that not only describe literally the objects in the image or clip, but also what is conveyed conceptually and thematically. We provide technical keywording assistance to contributors through our suggested keyword tools, which include a tool that leverages our proprietary computer vision technology to automatically suggest keywords based on visually similar images. We have compiled a vast amount of data relating to the content in our collection, including keywords and aggregated customer behavioral data, which combined with our proprietary computer vision and artificial intelligence technology, drives discovery of content through our search algorithms and search engine optimization (SEO), therefore empowering customers to discover the content best suited for their needs. 
Content accepted into our collection is added to our web properties where it is available for search, selection, license and download. Contributors are paid based on how many times their content has been licensed in the previous month. Contributors may choose to remove their content from our collection, subject to the terms of service that govern our contributor relationships. 
We provide different earnings structures to contributors based on content type and customers’ licensing needs:

• | Images. Contributors of photographs, vectors and illustrations to our e-commerce platform typically earn a royalty each time their images are licensed. The exact amount earned is determined by the type of license obtained and our published earnings schedule which is based on (i) the contributor’s total historical earnings paid by us, which determines the contributor’s earnings tier; and (ii) the purchase option under which the content was licensed. 

7

Contributors may earn more per download when images are licensed under our personalized licensing options or are licensed for editorial use only and, in these instances, can earn up to 50% of the sales price for a licensed image.

• | Video Clips and Music. Contributors of video clips and music tracks also typically earn a royalty each time their video clips or music tracks are licensed. When a contributed video clip or music track is licensed, the contributor is typically paid between 30% and 50% of the sales price per download. 

In addition to content sourced through direct submission to our e-commerce platform, we also obtain all types of content through exclusive distribution agreements with strategic partners or through the direct acquisition of content, content libraries or archives. In certain cases, we enter into arrangements with contributors or strategic partners whereby we guarantee a minimum royalty, usually paid up-front, in exchange for exclusive rights to distribute content when we believe such exclusivity provides us with a distinct competitive advantage. When we license content that has been obtained through direct acquisition, we pay no royalties. In recent years, we have enhanced our collection through the direct acquisition of content and by entering into other strategic agreements and partnerships. We have also enhanced our collections and our content acquisition capabilities through our acquisitions of PremiumBeat, Rex Features, The Picture Desk Limited, and Flashstock. We continue to seek opportunities for direct acquisition and strategic partnerships to enhance our collection and provide customers with relevant and high-quality content.
Technology and Infrastructure
Our technology is critical to our business and we have developed proprietary technology to power our products and services. We believe that delivering intuitive, fast and effective user experiences, supported by scalable technology platforms, is critical to our success. We employ technology to support both our public-facing web properties and our back-office systems. In developing and enhancing these sites and systems, we focus our internal development efforts on creating and enhancing specialized proprietary software that is unique to our business and we leverage commercially available and open source technologies for our more generalized needs.
Our customer-facing software enables users to search the millions of digital images, vectors, illustrations, video clips and music tracks available in our collection or request custom branded content and then select, organize, pay for, license and download the content that suits their individual needs. Our search platform evolves automatically based on behavioral data, with each search and download that a user performs on our platform providing our search engine with additional information to improve search results in subsequent queries. We consider the data that we have collected and the search technology that it powers to be an important proprietary asset and competitive advantage that allows us to provide exceptional service to our customers and enable our business. We also continue to invest in the localization of our creative platform across many countries and regions, allowing customers to search and make purchases in a variety of languages and currencies.
Further, we have continued to build and launch innovations to the customer experience. Over the last few years, we have launched additional tools on our platform, such as our in-browser image editing tools, Shutterstock Editor and Editor Pro, to further enhance the customer experience, improve the customer’s workflow and eliminate time-consuming steps in the creative process. We continued to improve the features, functionality and availability of these tools during 2018. We also maintain an API driven infrastructure, enabling integration of our content platform with various other software tools and services, which enables businesses to gain access to our content without leaving their platform. 
We have developed contributor-facing web properties that enable individuals and creative professionals to become contributors, upload and tag content, receive feedback on their submissions from our review team, see reports on earnings and payouts, and participate in online discussion forums with other contributors, among other activities. We have also developed proprietary tools to enable our contributors to improve their success on our web properties, including our keyword trends tool that allows contributors to see what terms customers are searching for and how those search terms are trending over time, which, in turn, allows contributors to anticipate demand and generate content that customers may want to license. Our contributor-facing web properties are powered by proprietary technology which supports a content review system that allows our review team to efficiently and effectively review content submissions. Our combination of proprietary technology and large-scale datasets allows us to deliver value to our users and enhances their experience on our platform, which drives and grows our marketplace. 
We use a combination of internally-developed software and third-party applications that enable customer and contributor support, intellectual property rights and license tracking, centralized invoicing and sales order processing, customer database management, language translation and global contributor payouts, in addition to supporting the compliance, finance and accounting functions.
Our systems infrastructure is hosted primarily by third-party cloud hosting providers that offer high-speed network access, auxiliary power generators and back-up systems. Further, we also maintain third-party production data centers to support certain applications and business continuity in the event of an emergency. While we have moved primarily to third-party cloud 
8

hosting providers, we also continue to invest in improvements to our infrastructure to improve the resiliency of our sites and systems. 
By using a cloud services provider, we believe we will be able to dedicate an increasing proportion of our technology resources to running and scaling our business, better serving our rapidly growing collection of content and scaling globally to meet customer demand. We believe continued use of public cloud hosting, along with improvements to our platform, will allow us to further diversify our product offerings, reach new customers and contributors around the world and, by removing inhibitors related to our infrastructure, enable our developers to rapidly deploy new products, features and functionality. 
We have expanded our use of content delivery network solutions to help enable our customers around the world to have sustained and reliable high-speed access to our content marketplace. As we continue to grow our business, our technological needs continue to expand and therefore, we continually invest in our technology to enhance existing products and services and to develop new products and services. We view our investments in technology as integral to our long-term success and we intend to continue to investigate, develop and make increased capital investments in technology and operational systems that support our current business and new areas of potential business expansion.
Marketing and Customer Support
We market to new customers through a diverse set of performance and brand marketing channels including paid search, online display advertising, print advertising, tradeshows, email marketing, direct mail, affiliate marketing, public relations, social media and partnerships. We also use customer relationship management (CRM) marketing to grow the lifetime value of our existing customers. Our marketing activities aim to raise awareness of our brands and attract paying customers to our websites and our direct sales organization by promoting the key value propositions of our offerings: diverse and high-quality content, intuitive and efficient interfaces and economical content options.
As our marketing efforts attract additional paying customers and generate more revenue for us, our contributors are also able to receive increased earnings from us. Increasing contributor earnings helps attract more content submissions, which in turn helps Shutterstock convert and retain even more paying customers. We believe the high degree of satisfaction that customers have with our product drives word-of-mouth recommendations, which helps our marketing efforts attract an even broader and diverse audience than we reach directly. Therefore, we believe our marketing efforts have a self-reinforcing network effect, which powers the growth and success of our marketplace.
Customer Support
In addition to outbound sales and marketing activities, our customer service teams assist users worldwide via email, chat and phone in over 20 languages and 150 countries. We have customer service teams in a variety of locations including Singapore, Berlin and New York. 
Product Rights and Intellectual Property
Product Rights and Indemnification
All of the content that we make available to customers on our websites is offered under perpetual, royalty-free licenses, with the exception of certain custom, editorial, music, and other content with specific licensing requirements. Royalty-free means that once a customer has licensed content from us, that customer may use the associated content in accordance with the license terms in perpetuity without having to pay any ongoing royalties to us. Typically, content from our library are licensed on a non-exclusive basis, meaning that multiple customers can license the same image, video clip or music track under the applicable Shutterstock license agreement. Custom content is one-of-a-kind branded content and licensed on an exclusive basis to our customers to fulfill their specific use-cases. We do not typically require that contributors of content to our library provide their content to us on an exclusive basis, with the exception of custom content and certain editorial, music and other content to which we have exclusive distribution rights. However, once a contributor’s content is licensed through our platform, such content is perpetually subject to the customer’s license even if the contributor removes the image from our marketplace, except in periodic circumstances where content is removed due to concerns about third-party intellectual property rights.
Under our various license agreements, we expressly represent and warrant that unaltered content downloaded and used in compliance with our license agreements and applicable law will not infringe any copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right, violate any third-party’s rights of privacy or publicity, violate any U.S. law, be defamatory or libelous, or be pornographic or obscene. Provided that a customer has not breached the license agreement or any other agreement with us, we will defend, indemnify, and hold a customer harmless from direct damages attributable to breaches of the express representations and warranties provided in our license agreements. From time to time, we agree to customize our license agreements with non-standard indemnification terms. Regardless of customization, indemnification only applies to claims for damages attributable to our breach of the express representations and warranties provided in our license agreement and is generally conditioned on our timely receipt of an indemnification claim and our right to assume the defense of such claim. Our 
9

license agreements generally cap our indemnification obligations at amounts ranging from $10,000 to $250,000, with exceptions for certain products for which our indemnification obligations may be uncapped. We maintain commercially reasonable insurance intended to protect against the costs of intellectual property litigation and our indemnification obligations under our license agreements.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and domain name registrations, as well as trade secret protections.
We own a portfolio of trademarks, including “Shutterstock,” “Offset,” “Bigstock,” “Rex Features,” “PremiumBeat” and “Shutterstock Editor” and associated logos. We will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent that we create any additional material and registrable trademarks or logos. We are the registered owner of a variety of the shutterstock.com, bigstock.com, offset.com, premiumbeat.com, and rexfeatures.com internet domain names and various other related domain names. We have successfully recovered infringing domain names in the past and intend to continue to enforce our rights in the future. We also own copyrights, including certain content on our web properties, publications and designs, as well as patents, including with respect to our display systems and search capabilities. These intellectual property rights are important to our business and marketing efforts. The duration of the protection afforded to our intellectual property depends on the type of property in question, the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction and the terms of our license agreements with others. With respect to our trademarks, trade names and patents, laws and rights are generally territorial in scope and limited to those countries where a mark has been registered or protected. While trademark registrations may generally be maintained in effect for as long as the mark is in use in the respective jurisdictions, there may be occasions where a mark or title is not registrable or protectable or cannot be used in a particular country. In addition, a trademark registration may be canceled or invalidated if challenged by others based on certain use requirements or other limited grounds. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate, relative to the expected lives of our products.
We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, including registration, in the United States and applicable foreign jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions. We enforce and protect our intellectual property rights through litigation from time to time, and by controlling access to our intellectual property and proprietary technology, in part, by entering into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, and vendors. In this way, we have historically chosen to protect our software and other technological intellectual property as trade secrets. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our websites’ terms of use and license agreements.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet as well as companies that provide content. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts, and the manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the internet and online content in general, and how the foregoing will relate to our business in particular, is still unclear in many cases. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data management and cybersecurity, content regulation, intellectual property ownership and infringement, defamation, advertising, marketing, data protection and personal information, taxation, e-commerce, subscription-based billing, quality of products and services, internet neutrality, outsourcing, securities law compliance, and online payment services. Additionally, because we operate internationally, we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the United States, including anti-money laundering, sanctions, anti-corruption and export control laws. A number of federal, state and foreign laws that could have an impact on our business practices and e-commerce generally have already been adopted, including, for example: 

• | The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), which regulates digital material and created updated copyright laws to address the unique challenges of regulating the use of digital content.


• | The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 and similar laws adopted by a number of states, which regulate the format, functionality and distribution of commercial solicitation e-mails, create criminal penalties for unmarked sexually-oriented material, and control other online marketing practices.


• | The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, which regulate the collection or use of information, and restrict the distribution of certain materials, as related to certain protected age groups. In addition, the Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998 provides for reporting and other obligations by online service providers in the area of child pornography.

10


• | The Federal Trade Commission Act and numerous state “mini-FTC” acts, which bar “deceptive” and “unfair” trade practices, including in the contexts of online advertising and representations made in privacy policies and other online representations.


• | The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which governs how we can collect and process the personal data of European Union citizens.

In particular, we are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and data protection as well as foreign, federal and state regulation. Foreign data protection, privacy, content regulation, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States and often have extraterritorial application, and the interpretation and application of these laws are still uncertain and in flux. For example, GDPR, which took effect on May 25, 2018, includes more stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information and significant penalties for non-compliance. Several other foreign jurisdictions, such as Brazil and India, have adopted, are considering adopting, or have updated comprehensive privacy legislation to offer additional data privacy protections for individuals. In the U.S., data protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common at both the federal and state level. There are a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning privacy, security, content regulation, data protection and other consumer issues that could affect us. For example, the State of California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which becomes effective in January 2020, which requires companies that process information on California residents to make disclosures to their consumers about data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. 
In addition, from a taxation perspective, there are applicable and potential government regulatory matters that may impact us. In particular, on December 22, 2017, H.R.1 (commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”)) was signed into law, representing a significant overhaul to the U.S. federal income tax code. The TCJA has a significant impact on our financial statements for 2017 and 2018 and will have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations in future years. Although the U.S. Treasury Department issued several proposed regulations during 2018, the TCJA continues to be open to further interpretation and technical corrections by the U.S. Treasury Department and the I.R.S. The final impact of the TCJA on our tax provisions, may materially differ from the estimates provided. Further, we continue to remain subject to uncertainty related to foreign jurisdictions potential reactions to the TCJA. As these and other tax laws and related regulations evolve, our financial results could prospectively be materially impacted. 
The application, interpretation, and enforcement of these U.S. and foreign laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. Any existing or new legislation applicable to our operations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, to respond to regulatory inquiries or investigations, and to defend individual or class litigation. These events could dampen growth in the use of the internet in general, and cause Shutterstock to divert significant resources and funds to addressing these issues, and possibly require us to change our business practices.
Competition
We compete to be an integral component of the creative process for our customers based on a number of factors including the quality, relevance and breadth of content; ability to source new content; accessibility of content, distribution capabilities; ease and speed of search and fulfillment; content pricing models and practices; content licensing options and the degree to which users are protected from legal risk; brand recognition and reputation; the effective use of current and emerging technology; the global nature of our interfaces and marketing efforts, including the degree of localization; and customer service. We also compete for contributors on the basis of several similar factors including ease and speed of the upload and content review process; the volume of customers who license their submitted content; contributor commission models and practices; the degree to which contributors are protected from legal risk; brand recognition and reputation; the effective use of technology; the global nature of the our interfaces; and customer service.
The industry in which we operate is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving, with low barriers to entry. Some of our currently and potentially significant competitors include:

• | other online platforms that feature marketplaces for stock content or creative workflow tools such as Getty Images and its iStockphoto offering and AdobeStock;


• | specialized visual content companies that are established in local, content or product-specific market segments, such as Visual China Group;

• | providers of commercially licensable music such as Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Warner/Chappell Music, and EMI Music Publishing;


• | websites focused on image search and discovery such as Google Images;


• | websites for image hosting, art and related products such as Flickr;


• | providers of free images, photography, music, stock video clips and related tools;


• | social networking and social media services; and


• | commissioned photographers and photography agencies.

In addition, we compete with the alternative of creating one’s own content or choosing not to consume licensed content due to price considerations or because the user is not aware of how to access licensed content.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, our global workforce included 1,029 full-time employees as compared to 1,130 on December 31, 2017. None of our employees in the United States are covered by collective bargaining arrangements. In several foreign jurisdictions, including Germany, Canada and France, our employees may be subject to national collective bargaining agreements that set minimum salaries, benefits, working conditions and/or termination requirements. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists and other technical staff. 
Seasonality
Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors. Our quarterly and annual results may reflect the effects of intra-period trends in customer behavior. For example, we expect certain customers’ usage to decrease during the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to the year-end holiday season, and to increase in the first quarter of each calendar year as many customers return to work. Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from repeat customers who have purchased subscription plans, our revenues have historically been less volatile than if we had no subscription-based customers.
