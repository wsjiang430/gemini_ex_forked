 Household Products
During 2022, products in our household segment included:
 •Scott’s Liquid Gold® Wood Care;
 •Scott’s Liquid Gold® Floor Restore; 
 •Kids N Pets® and Messy Pet®; and
 •BIZ®.


Scott’s Liquid Gold® Wood Care has been sold in the United States for over 70 years. Our Scott’s Liquid Gold® Floor Restore product is a quick and easy way to renew and protect hardwood floors. On January 23, 2023, we sold the Scott’s Liquid Gold® brand, including the Wood Care and Floor Restore products, to a company that markets and distributes wood care products.
On October 1, 2019, we acquired the Kids N Pets® and Messy Pet® brands. Founded in 1989, Kids N Pets® brands are award-winning, safe, stain and odor removing products targeted toward households with children and pets. These high-quality, high-value products excel at controlling odor and cleaning up kid and pet accidents, and food and drink stains while being products that parents can feel safe using around their children and pets. The primary sales channels for Kids N Pets® and Messy Pet® are through retail stores such as Walmart and Home Depot, and online through e-commerce retailers such as Amazon.
 On July 1, 2020, we acquired BIZ® and Dryel® brands. BIZ® is a top performing detergent in the market, utilizing a proprietary enzyme-based formula to fight stains and eliminate odors. It was established by Procter & Gamble in 1968 and is sold in Powder, Liquid, and Liquid Booster Packs.
 On December 23, 2021, we sold the Dryel® brand. We have reflected the operations of Dryel® as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 3 - “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Health and Beauty Care Products
During 2022, products in our health and beauty care segment included:
 •Alpha® Skin Care; 
 •Neoteric Diabetic Skin Care® ; 
 •Prell® and;
 •Denorex® and Zincon®.
 Our Alpha® Skin Care brand was one of the first to use alpha hydroxy acids (“AHAs”) in lines of facial care products, body lotion, and body wash. Products containing AHAs gently slough off dead skin cells to promote a healthier, more youthful appearance and help to diminish fine lines and wrinkles.
 In 2016, we acquired the Prell®, Denorex® and Zincon® brands of hair and scalp care products. Our Denorex® products are dermatologist-recommended medicated hair care products to control the symptoms of dandruff and other scalp conditions. Our Zincon® product is a medicated anti-dandruff shampoo.
 We were a distributor in the United States for Batiste Dry Shampoo from 2009 through 2021. Under our distribution agreement with the manufacturer of Batiste Dry Shampoo, Church & Dwight Co. Inc. (“Church & Dwight”), we were the exclusive specialty retail distributor in the United States of Batiste Dry Shampoo until our agreement expired on December 31, 2021.
 On December 15, 2022, we sold the Prell® brand to a company that markets and distributes natural hair and skin care products. We have reflected the operations of Prell® as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 3 - “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
 Marketing and Distribution
We primarily market our products through: (1) trade promotions to support price features, displays, slotting fees and other merchandising of our products by our retail customers; (2) consumer marketing in print, social and digital media; and (3) to a lesser extent, consumer incentives such as coupons and rebates.
 Our products are sold nationally through our sales force to mass merchandisers, drugstores, supermarkets, hardware stores, e-commerce retailers, and other retail outlets and to wholesale distributors. Our products were previously sold internationally through independent distributors in Canada and China.


The table set forth below shows net sales to our significant customers as a percentage of consolidated net sales during 2022 and 2021:

 | % of Net Sales | 
 | 2022 | | | 2021
Walmart | | 42.7 | % | | 30.9 | %
Ulta | | 0.7 | % | | 18.8 | %

 As is typical in our industry, we do not have long-term contracts with Walmart, Ulta, or any other retail customer.
 Historically, we have used our websites for sales of our products directly to consumers. Beginning in January 2022, our websites redirect consumers to our e-commerce retail partners to fulfill sales of our products directly to our consumers.
International sales were historically made to distributors who were responsible for the selling and marketing of the products, and we were paid for these products in United States dollars. In February 2022, we discontinued sales of our Denorex® products to Canada due to uneconomic results. With the sale of the Scott’s Liquid Gold® brand in January 2023, we no longer have any products distributed in Canada.
 We terminated our exclusive distribution agreement for sales in China with HK NFS Limited (“HK NFS”) on July 12, 2022 due to breaches of the distribution agreement by HK NFS, and began establishing a direct model to resume sales of our products to consumers in China.
 Under our distribution agreement with Church & Dwight, we were the exclusive distributor of Batiste Dry Shampoo products in the specialty retailer channel in the United States through December 31, 2021.
 From time to time, our customers return products to us. For our household products, we permit returns only for a limited time. For our health and beauty care products, returns are accepted for a greater period of time in order to maintain or enhance our relationship with the customer. Typically, customers are granted a credit equal to the original sale price plus a handling charge.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
As of March 2020, we identified third-party logistics and contract manufacturing partners for our product lines, and we no longer manufacture or ship any of our products directly to our retail partners.
 Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source suppliers. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. Due primarily to COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions that have continued as the economy re-opens, we experienced limited supply constraints and commodity costs increases for certain raw materials and finished goods. When prices for these items change, we may or may not be able to pass the change to our customers. The Company expects continued volatility and increased cost pressures in both commodities and transportation to continue in fiscal year 2023.
 Competition
 Both the household and health and beauty care product categories are highly competitive and innovative. We compete in both categories against a range of competitors, most of which are significantly larger and have greater financial resources, name recognition, innovation capabilities, and product and market diversification than us. We compete in both categories primarily on the basis of quality, brand recognition, and the distinguishing characteristics of our products. The wood care and laundry care product categories are dominated by a small number of companies that are significantly larger than us and each of these competitors produces several competing products. In the health and beauty care category, several of our competitors are also significantly larger than us and each of these competitors produces several competing products.
Regulation
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that pertain to the types of consumer products that we manufacture and sell. Many chemicals used in consumer products, some of which are used in several of our product formulations, have come under scrutiny by various state governments and the federal government. Some of these chemicals are called volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”). All of our products currently meet the most stringent VOC regulations and may be sold throughout the United States. Many of our skin care products, several of which contain AHAs, are considered cosmetics within the definition of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FFDCA”). Our cosmetic products are subject to the regulations under the FFDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. The relevant laws and regulations are enforced by the FDA. We believe that we are producing and marketing all of our products in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the markets in which we participate.
 Our advertising is subject to regulation under the Federal Trade Commission Act and related regulations, which prohibit false and misleading claims in advertising. Private and derivative labeling claims are common in this industry and can result in costly settlements and distraction of management. Changes in these regulations, or interpretations or enforcement of these regulations, could adversely affect our profitability, result in regulatory actions, or private or derivative claims.
 Our international sales are primarily conducted in China. As such, we may be impacted by regulations, economic conditions, and tariffs imposed by the PRC.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed 22 people, who work in administrative, sales, advertising, marketing and operational functions. Through our history, we appreciate the importance of retention, growth and development of our employees. We believe we offer competitive compensation (including salary, incentive bonus, and equity) and benefits packages to our employees. We are also focused on understanding our diversity and inclusion strengths and opportunities and executing on a strategy to support further progress. We continue to focus on building a pipeline for talent to create more opportunities for workplace diversity and to support greater representation within the Company.
 No contracts exist between us and any union. The compensation of our executive officers is subject to annual review by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.
 Patents and Trademarks
At present, we own one patent for our Neoteric Diabetic® Healing Cream. Additionally, we actively use our registered trademarks for Alpha® Skin Care, Denorex®, Zincon®, Neoteric Diabetic Skin Care®, Neoteric®, Kids N Pets®, Messy Pet®, and BIZ® in the United States and have registered trademarks in a number of additional countries. Our registered trademarks protect names and logos relating to our products as well as the design of boxes for certain of our products. We transferred all registered trademarks of our Scott’s Liquid Gold® brand as part of the sale of that brand in January 2023.
