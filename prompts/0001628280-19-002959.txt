Overview
We are a life sciences instrumentation company in the genome analysis space. We develop and market the Saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic targets and to streamline the study of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Our Saphyr system comprises an instrument, chip consumables, reagents and a suite of data analysis tools. 
Structural variation refers to large-scale structural differences in the genomic DNA of one individual compared to another. Each structural variation involves the rearrangement or repetition of as few as hundreds to as many as tens of millions of DNA base pairs. Those rearrangements may be insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions or translocations of segments of one or more chromosomes. Structural variations may be inherited or arise spontaneously, and many cause genetic disorders and diseases. Until our commercial launch of the Saphyr system in February 2017, and since, we believe no products existed or exist that could more comprehensively and cost and time-efficiently detect structural variation. 
Our customers include researchers and clinicians who seek to uncover and understand the biological or clinical impact of genome variation to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with better clinical tests and new medicines or to replace existing cytogenetic tests that are expensive, slow and labor-intense, with a modern solution that simplifies workflow and reduces costs and that has the potential to significantly increase diagnostic yields across the industry. Our customers also include researchers in non-human segments such as agricultural genomics where they seek to advance their understanding of how structural variation impacts industrial applications of plants and animals. We have established relationships with key opinion leaders in genomics research and clinical applications, including rare diseases and oncology, and our installed base of over 110 systems made up of Saphyr and its predecessor system includes some of the world’s most prominent clinical, translational research, basic research, academic and government institutions as well as leading pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies. Examples include Children’s National Health System, DuPont Pioneer, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Genentech, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University, National Institutes of Health, Pennsylvania State University and Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Our revenues in 2017 were $9.5 million, representing approximately 40% growth over the prior year, and for 2018 our revenues were $12 million representing approximately 26% growth over the prior year comparable period. 
Approximately 6,000 research use only, or RUO, high throughput sequencers are currently installed worldwide. These sequencers are developed and sold almost entirely by Illumina and are owned by an estimated 3,000 unique customers. Sequencing is very good at detecting genome differences involving just a few base pairs or single-nucleotide variations, which Saphyr cannot detect, but sequencing including next-generation sequencing, or NGS, cannot reliably detect the larger structural variations that our Saphyr system can detect. Therefore, Saphyr is being adopted alongside this installed base of sequencers as a complement that gives users the ability to see a much wider scope of genome variation than ever before. 
The Saphyr system, which is for RUO, is also beginning to be adopted by cytogenetics labs that seek to use it in commercial clinical tests of its patients as a laboratory-developed test, or LDT. These labs currently rely on existing methods such as karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH, and microarrays for clinical tests and research that look at chromosomal structure, location and function in cells. Major guidelines for oncology and genetic disease clinical diagnostics recommend first-line structural variation testing by these existing methods. The organizations issuing these guidelines include, among many others, World Health Organization (WHO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) and American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ACOG). 
Saphyr and its predecessor system, which we collectively refer to as our system in this Annual Report, have been cited by researchers and clinicians in hundreds of publications covering structural variations in areas of high unmet medical need and research interest, such as rare and undiagnosed pediatric diseases, muscular diseases, developmental delays and disorders, prostate cancer and leukemia. Importantly, Saphyr can be used alone to provide comprehensive detection of structural variations and enable diagnostic calls without the need for any sequencing or cytogenetic technology. 
Industry Background 
Genome analysis is the process of extracting biological information from DNA. DNA is the code that is found in all living cells and determines the characteristics and health of all living organisms. Although each organism’s DNA order is unique, all DNA is composed of the same four nucleotides that come in pairs, which are referred to as base pairs. The human genome is composed of six billion of these base pairs (three billion of which are the maternal copy and three billion of which are the paternal copy of the genome), distributed 
2

across 23 pairs of chromosomes ranging in size from approximately 50 million to approximately 250 million base pairs. Genome variation is defined as at least one base pair differing in a comparison of sequence against a reference standard and can be as large as tens of millions of base pairs. 
It had long been believed by the scientific community that all problems in genome analysis could be addressed by DNA sequencing, which is a method of determining the precise order of the bases adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T) in a genome. Many in the industry felt that the only bottlenecks for sequencing companies to address were the cost per genome and the throughput of the sequencers. If these issues could be addressed, it was generally believed that sequencing would usher in a new wave of medical-grade genome analysis that would give rise to an abundance of highly impactful discoveries in medicine. These discoveries would lead to novel therapies and patient management pathways driven by exquisitely specific and sensitive diagnostic tests. 
In recent years, however, it has become evident that sequencing is not completely fulfilling the needs of researchers and clinicians. For example, after 10 years with next-generation sequencing in use, the diagnostic yields of the leading genetic testing laboratories in the world continue to hover around only 50%, which is where they have been for at least two decades, meaning that only half of patients receive a confirmed pathogenic diagnosis. Researchers and clinicians now agree that despite major advances in the speed and cost-effectiveness of sequencing, it fails to reliably detect structural variations, which represent an entire class of genome variation. 
Structural variation is one of the most biologically important aspects of the human genome. It is the underlying driver of many known human diseases, including numerous genetic disorders, inherited diseases and cancer. Structural variations occur when relatively large groups of base pairs change their existence or position in the genome relative to a normal standard. Structural variations can be as small as a few hundred base pairs or as large as tens of millions of base pairs and can be confined to one chromosome or can unfold between chromosomes. The changes can be rearrangements in location, order or orientation, and they can involve the insertion, deletion or duplication of entire blocks of base pairs. As an example of the importance of structural variations, thousands of base pairs can be rearranged and result in the ABL gene from one chromosome joining the BCR gene on an entirely different chromosome to form BCR-ABL, an oncogenic fusion gene which causes certain leukemias. 
We believe the available methods to detect structural variations for research and clinical applications, other than Saphyr, are antiquated and cumbersome and can only detect a small proportion of the structural variations across an entire genome. These methods therefore have very limited utility in population research studies that seek to discover new structural variations to explain pathology. Without additional tools, researchers and clinicians cannot comprehensively study the genome, which will ultimately result in the failure of genomics to deliver on its full promise of new therapies and diagnostics. 
The Saphyr system provides a solution for comprehensive structural variation analysis. The Saphyr system is a proprietary, sample-to-result platform based on physical mapping of the genome, which is the process of assigning the chromosomal location, order and orientation of the functional elements of the genome. We believe that Saphyr is the only product capable of detecting structural variations at high sensitivity and specificity with a workflow that is cost-effective and time-efficient. A complete and accurate physical map of the genome enables the user to much more readily and systematically detect the structural variations that sequencing and cytogenetics technologies miss. Our mapping makes it possible for researchers and clinicians to more comprehensively detect structural variations and measure the complete scope of genome variation present in their study populations. 
Market Opportunity 
According to Research and Markets, the worldwide market for genomics products and services is expected to reach approximately $23.9 billion by 2022, up from approximately $14.7 billion in 2017, representing a compound annual growth rate of 10.2%. We believe that the market opportunity is predominantly split among three regions: North America, Europe and Asia. Within Asia, one of the fastest growing genomics markets is China, where adoption of genome analysis technology has been growing at approximately 20% per year. 
The two segments of the genomics market that are driving the uptake of our product are: 

• | Sequencing for Discovery Research. In discovery research across patient cohorts, sequencing is primarily used to find single nucleotide variations responsible for disease or therapeutic response. Sequencing alone, however, is significantly limited due to its inability to reveal structural variations. Our Saphyr system has been expanding this market segment by complementing sequencing to expand the scope of genome variation that can be analyzed in a study and achieve a more comprehensive view of the genome.


• | Cytogenetics. To provide a clinical diagnosis, cytogenetic tests detect known variations that are linked to specific diseases or therapeutic responses. The technologies used for detecting structural variations are expensive and involve cumbersome workflows with relatively limited ability to scale to higher volumes or more complex testing panels. Sequencers tend not to be used for cytogenetics due to their inability to reliably detect structural variations. Cytogenetics laboratories are beginning to adopt Saphyr as a more effective and efficient approach to finding the structural variations relevant to cytogenetics. For

3

this segment, Saphyr is used alone to provide comprehensive detection of structural variations and enable diagnostic calls without the need for any sequencing or cytogenetic technology. 
We believe that the discovery research and cytogenetics segments together comprise an addressable opportunity for us to sell up to approximately 8,500 Saphyr systems, representing a current total instrument market opportunity of approximately $2.1 billion. Importantly, we expect this market opportunity to expand at the rate of adoption of new RUO high throughput sequencers which we estimate is over 15% per year. While we do not expect the number of cytogenetics labs to increase significantly, we do expect our growth in this market to be driven by conversion of traditional cytogenetics methodologies to our Saphyr system. 
In addition to the instrument sales opportunity, Saphyr instruments generate recurring revenue from chip consumables that are used on a per-sample basis. We believe each Saphyr instrument has the potential to create recurring revenue in a range of approximately $75,000 to approximately $150,000 per year, suggesting a potential annual recurring revenue opportunity of approximately $0.6 billion to approximately $1.3 billion. 
Therefore, we believe that our currently addressable portion of the genome analysis market is estimated to be between $2.7 billion and $3.4 billion. 
Existing Technologies and Their Limitations 
Existing technologies fail to adequately address the need for structural variation detection because they do not overcome the inherent complexity of the genome or they are not capable of providing a cost-effective, scalable solution to meet the increasing demands of genomics research and clinical applications. 
The Genome Is Complex 
Genome composition itself makes the measurement of genome structure and structural variation inherently difficult. Genome sequence is built from combinations of only the A, G, C and T nucleotides. The nucleotides have a natural pairing system in which A pairs with T and G pairs with C. Each pair of nucleotides is referred to as a base pair. In humans, the approximately six billion base pairs are distributed across 23 pairs of chromosomes. A chromosome is an organizational unit that biology has evolved to compartmentalize genomic information. One set of 23 chromosomes (three billion base pairs) is inherited from each parent. Within each chromosome, the base pairs are organized into functional elements such as genes, which code for protein production, and other elements that regulate how and when the genes are expressed for protein production. 
The six billion base pairs that make up the human genome cannot be read by any existing technology in a simple linear, contiguous fashion. Due in part to only four unique nucleotides being available to write the entire genetic code, it is very common for stretches of sequence to be identical either within the same chromosome or between chromosomes. As much as two-thirds of the human genome is made up of repetitive DNA sequences. This repetition tends to cause structural variations to be flanked by sequences that are identical to sequences in other parts of the genome which further complicates structural variation detection. 
The Genome Orchestrates Life and Genome Structure Is Key 
Genome structure is the way in which the functional elements are organized. Namely, the location on each chromosome where the gene or functional regulatory elements are found, what order and orientation they are in and how many of each element are present. This organization is an essential part of the instructions that the organism uses in every one of its cells to develop and differentiate and to react and respond to its environment over its lifetime. When this critical location, order, orientation or quantity vary, it is termed structural variation. 
Even though both single nucleotide variation and structural variation are each very common, a much larger number of variant nucleotides in the average human genome are found in structural variations as compared to single nucleotide variations. A recent study showed that 30 million base pairs, on average, in the human genome are part of structural variations while only 10 million are single nucleotide variations. Most variations are inconsequential and make up the background variation responsible for the diversity of life. Over time, these variations can randomly affect genes and proteins which, through natural selection, drive diversity and evolution across species and diversity within them. Variations can also cause disease. 
Relative to single nucleotide variations, structural variations are much more apt to be profoundly disruptive. They often cause a tectonic shift in the genome. These genomic shifts can have devastating effects on the health of a human. Examples where structural variations caused a disruption of genes resulting in disease include: 

• | dystrophin gene variation – structural variation disrupting dystrophin production that is found in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy;

4


• | 9pminus variation – deletion found in a rare developmental syndrome in children;


• | TMPRSS2-ERG fusion – gene fusion found in prostate cancer;


• | EML4-ALK fusion – gene fusion found in lung cancer; and


• | BCR-ABL fusion (Philadelphia chromosome) – gene fusion found in leukemias such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia.

It is important to detect these structural variations and the potentially thousands of other structural variations in each individual. Sequencing and cytogenetics simply do not elucidate comprehensive structural variations in a systematic and cost- and time-efficient manner. Most structural variations found to date that have been implicated in disease, such as those listed above, were discovered through laborious, expensive, unindustrialized and non-comprehensive methods over the course of many years. Thousands of additional important structural variations are believed to exist and are expected to be found with a systematic structural variation detection tool such as our Saphyr. 
The Limitations of Sequencing 
As the first complete draft of the human genome was being assembled in 2000, the belief arose that most questions in genome analysis could be addressed by sequencing. Over the course of over 15 years, sequencing proliferated across the entire genome analysis community with Illumina becoming the clear sequencing industry leader. As more sequencing data emerged, it became apparent that sequencing alone would not adequately elucidate the causes of human disease. The promise of sequencing was not fully delivered due to sequencing’s inability to address the complexities of genome composition. 
Nearly all genome sequencing, including next-generation sequencing, uses a method called sequencing by synthesis. Sequencing by synthesis is an in-vitro process for synthesizing a copy of DNA, one base at a time in a way that makes it possible to measure the identity of each base as it is incorporated into the growing DNA copy. Sequencing by synthesis involves cutting genomic DNA into small pieces of a few hundred base pairs each, amplifying these pieces many times and anchoring them to a solid support where they are copied by a polymerase using fluorescently labeled bases. These copies are called sequencing reads. Illumina, which is the world leader in next-generation sequencing technology, markets systems that provide average read lengths that are 100 to 300 base pairs long. These short reads are matched by computer programs to a reference genome in a process called alignment. The reference is meant to represent the “standard” human genome in a normal, non-diseased state. It is the result of billions of dollars spent on the Human Genome Project and other initiatives begun in the late 1990s and early 2000s to put together the first complete set of human DNA code. When a patient’s genome is sequenced today, the short reads are compared against the reference as a template. Using this approach, sequencing attempts to reconstruct, or “resequence,” the genome and infer genome variations. 
The read lengths typical for next-generation sequencing are often too short to determine the right location and orientation of a reading frame in the genome because many of the reads from one chromosome are identical to reads from either another chromosome or even another location on the same chromosome. When reads are indistinguishable from one another, computations cannot be performed to place the reads in the correct location in the genome. 
The other significant limitation with next-generation sequencing is that the genome fragments used as templates in the copying process are also very short. This fragmentation is a result of the methods used for DNA isolation from the cell and the use of polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. These short lengths disconnect and destroy most of the structural information of the original genome and make next-generation sequencing unable to reliably detect genomic variations larger than a few hundred base pairs. 
If the sequencing reads were accurate, on the order of hundreds of thousands of base pairs long and from templates that were even longer, they would overcome the redundancy of genome composition and every read would have a unique position in the genome. It would then be possible to assemble a structurally accurate picture of the genome. Accurate structural variation would be revealed upon comparing structurally accurate assemblies of genomes across a population to determine the structural changes that are driving the observed pathology or physiology. 
The recognition of the need for greater lengths of sequence reads to determine genome structure, birthed the so-called long-read sequencing submarket. Because of the need for long-read sequencing, Pacific Biosciences of California developed a system that uses another alternative form of sequencing by synthesis, while Oxford Nanopore Technologies developed a system that uses nanopore technology. These systems provide users with average read lengths in the tens of thousands of base pairs. However, these read lengths have proven not to be long enough to reliably and comprehensively detect structural variations. Pacific Biosciences’ polymerases cannot regularly produce reads that are the necessary hundreds of thousands of base pairs in length. In addition, Oxford Nanopore’s system has difficulty reliably feeding molecules that are, on average, hundreds of thousands of base pairs in length through each nanopore. The time and cost of providing a comprehensive whole genome analysis of a patient in a clinical setting is prohibitive when using these longer-read technologies.

In summary, all existing sequencing technologies, whether short or long, do no provide a solution for integrating structural variation into patient diagnosis and management. 
The Limitations of Cytogenetics 
Cytogenetics is the study of chromosomal structure and how structural variations impact health. The field has historically relied on karyotyping, FISH and more recently, microarrays. These methods each can detect some structural variations, but they are all inadequate solutions for high volume and low cost genetic testing for structural variations and none is an approach that can comprehensively detect structural variations with the ultra-high sensitivity and ultra-high specificity of the Saphyr system. 
Karyotyping 
Karyotyping is the gross optical examination of the chromosomes using a microscope. It is a laboratory technique, modernized in the 1960s, whereby the chromosomes from one cell are stained and visualized by a pathologist or technician to investigate the total number and structure of chromosomes. 
Karyotyping has many limitations. It is cell culture dependent and therefore requires live and actively dividing cells. Karyotyping has extremely low resolution and is therefore only sensitive for very large structural variations that are unambiguous to identify. Given that chromosomes are being directly viewed on a slide by a pathologist with a microscope, resolution tends to be limited to structural events that are larger than five million base pairs. When karyotyping is used to diagnose unknown genetic disease, only about 5% of karyotyping tests result in a confirmed pathogenic finding. The test is costly, and its results are subject to each pathologist’s interpretation which introduces variability in diagnostic calls and makes the methodology not amenable to automation. 
FISH 
FISH is a molecular cytogenetic technique that is used to detect chromosomal aberrations. FISH is based on the idea of using a specifically developed probe to detect a particular gene abnormality that is suspected to be in the genome. When the probe finds targeted variation, it binds to it and generates a fluorescent signal which is observed with a fluorescence microscope. 
Several characteristics of FISH limit its productivity and efficiency for use in structural variation detection. Like karyotyping, it is cell culture dependent and therefore requires live and actively dividing cells. Also, FISH is limited to known targets and cannot be used for discovery. Every FISH test performed needs to be chosen to look for a specific genetic marker that the clinician anticipates may be found based on the clinical symptoms of the patient. In addition, the test results can be ambiguous and inconclusive, and reproducibility and variability among users can be a significant issue. Like karyotyping, FISH’s diagnostic yield is very low when used to diagnose unknown genetic disease with only an estimated 7% of FISH providing a confirmed pathogenic finding. In addition, FISH is expensive, especially for the limited amount of information that it provides. 
Microarrays 
Chromosomal microarrays and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) arrays are tests consisting of slides that contain thousands of spots of DNA fragments that bind to the DNA of the sample. Microarrays detect gains and losses of specifically chosen DNA sequence and can also infer gene expression levels. Microarrays interrogate thousands of genes simultaneously that are known to be associated with presumed genetic disorders of interest to the user. Probe coverage is typically highly focused in regions of known clinical significance. 
Microarrays have limited utility as a diagnostic tool as they are only useful when there are gains and losses of base pairs within the sample’s genome that are specific to the probes that are populated on the array. Microarrays are also limited in their ability to provide specific locations of gains or losses on a chromosome, or even identify on which chromosome that the gains or losses occur. In addition, microarrays have low resolution as they cannot reliably detect structural variants smaller than 50,000 base pairs. Also, the diagnostic yield of microarrays is low. Only an estimated 20% of microarray tests provide a confirmed pathogenic finding when used to diagnose unknown genetic disease.

Our Solution 
Our approach to measuring genome structure and structural variation is novel and highly differentiated. Most efforts in the genomic industry to address structural variation have been based on taking sequencing by synthesis as the starting point and attempting to overcome its deficiencies to make it applicable to structural variation analysis. In contrast, the Saphyr system directly observes extremely long genomic DNA without any amplification to construct a physical map that accurately assigns the chromosomal location, order, orientation and quantity of all the genome’s functional elements. Our solution is built upon four key elements: 

• | Extremely long molecules for analysis. Structural accuracy can only come from analysis of extremely long chromosomal fragments. The Saphyr system is capable of analyzing single molecules that are on average approximately 250,000 base pairs long. Such fragments will contain enough unique sequence information that they are distinguishable from other fragments. These lengths are over 1,000 times longer than the average read length with Illumina systems and approximately 10 times longer than the average read lengths with Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore systems. Building a picture of the genome with massive building blocks overcomes the inherent challenge of genome complexity and is the key to Saphyr’s unprecedented sensitivity and specificity.


• | Proprietary nanotechnology for massively parallel linearization and analysis of long molecules with single molecule imaging. Analyzing these extremely long chromosomal fragments required invention. Molecules of this size are more like balls of yarn in a test tube and must be unraveled for meaningful analysis. We invented, patented, developed and commercialized nanochannel arrays to capture them from solution and unwind and linearize them for structural variation analysis. Each molecule is imaged separately, making it possible to deconvolute complex mixtures including haplotypes and heterogeneous tumors, as shown in the graphic below.


• | DNA labeling chemistry specifically for physical mapping. The detailed analysis of sequence we use is also highly unique and novel. Instead of identifying the sequence of every base pair in these long fragments, we label and detect specific sequence patterns or motifs that occur universally across every genome with an average frequency of approximately one site for every few thousand base pairs. The key to our method entails introducing fluorescent tags at the sequence-specific site using highly specific and robust enzymatic chemistry along the extremely long fragments. These fragments, stretched out in nanochannels, are then directly imaged allowing us to measure the distance between labels with high accuracy. The pattern of labels detected on all these fragments can then be related to the pattern of sequence motif sites in a reference genome for comparison. Changes in the pattern indicate structural variation.


• | Bioinformatic tools for structural variation analysis. Finally, our approach includes a novel bioinformatics platform that we developed from the ground-up to take advantage of the unique benefits of our solution. It comprises proprietary algorithms for the construction of a structurally accurate physical map of the genome without using a reference genome in assignment of structure. Physical maps of a test subject are then compared in cross-mapping analysis that allows our system to detect genome wide structural variation, including the most complex balanced events. Our system can do so by comparing one physical map against a common reference, or against the maps of a mother and father in the case of an afflicted child with an undiagnosed disease for example, or against maps of normal blood when studying solid tumor cancers. This comparative approach uses our proprietary database of healthy individuals to filter out the non-disease causing structural variants found in the general healthy population.

Our Focus Areas 
Our Saphyr system serves many segments of the genomics market seeking to find and understand structural variation. We have identified focus areas where we concentrate our resources to ensure robust adoption of our system and frequent utilization of consumables. We have selected these segments because of their urgent need to detect structural variations and the significant economic opportunity they represent. Our current focus areas are human genetic diseases, including rare diseases and oncology. Our Saphyr system, which is for RUO, is being used for basic and translational research and also beginning to be adopted by cytogenetics labs that seek to use it in commercial clinical tests of its patients as an LDT. 
Rare Diseases 
In genetic disease, existing tools have reached a plateau where almost half of patients with genetic disease who are tested in clinical laboratories fail to receive a molecular diagnosis. In order to increase diagnostic yield, a massive increase in the understanding of the complete structure and variation of the genome is essential. We believe the various studies presented below illustrate how Saphyr is essential to achieving this objective. 
Example: Undiagnosed Diseases Network Patient 
The National Institutes of Health funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network, or UDN, brings together top clinical and genomics teams from several key institutes in the U.S. to study the most difficult to diagnose genetic disease patients. Through a collaboration with UCLA, Dr. Eric Vilain of Children’s National Medical Center runs all UDN patients of the UCLA cohort on Saphyr to identify pathogenic variants that go undetected using sequencing or cytogenetics in known or novel genes. 
While data collection and a full analysis of the cohort is ongoing, at the American Society of Human Genetics, or ASHG, annual meeting, Dr. Vilain’s team presented preliminary results on the first 12 UDN patients and their parents analyzed with Saphyr. In each family, Saphyr detected thousands of variants of which more than 100 were rare, and typically three to seven structural variations that were new to the patient, referred to as de novo structural variations, were identified. In one case presented at ASHG, whole genome sequencing and chromosomal microarray on the DNA of a girl with developmental delay, autism, poor sleep and self-mutilation failed to identify pathogenic variants. Saphyr was able to detect a 2,500-base pair insertion inherited from the father in a gene where whole genome sequencing had picked up a random mutation inherited from the mother. Together, the two variants create a compound heterozygous mutation in a gene with a known phenotype that includes poor sleep, developmental delay and autism with self-mutilation. Large heterozygous insertions like the one presented here are seldomly detected by next-generation sequencing and are too small for microarrays. The diagnosis of this patient was only possible by the combination of next-generation sequencing and Saphyr. 
Based on Dr. Vilain’s results, including a study on patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy published in Genome Medicine, Saphyr targets the 40% to 70% of genetics patients who cannot be diagnosed with exome or whole genome sequencing. Saphyr has the power to replace multiple tests for genetic disorders, including microarrays, PCR tests and chromosomal cytogenetic tests. Each existing test requires a patient to visit a clinician and most often provides an inconclusive result. Dr. Vilain showed evidence that integration of Saphyr into existing diagnostic regimens can help to change the way that medicine is practiced. 
Example: Rare Familial Cancer 
A rare cancer, occurring in approximately one in one million people, was found in four members of a single extended family. A team at MD Anderson Cancer Center had used all standard clinical tools and whole genome sequencing on the affected family members but failed to identify any causative variants. Using Saphyr data, a 38,000-base pair sequence was found in these patients in six tandem copies, while unaffected family members had a single copy of this sequence. The duplication was found to be upstream of an important gene in the pathway known to be upregulated in this rare cancer. The identification of this mutation could be useful for pre-implantation embryo analysis and targeted treatments. 
Example: Repeat Expansion Disorder 
In a study by Dr. Eric Wang of the University of Florida, Saphyr was able to precisely count the number of times that a sequence segment was repeated in muscle cells derived from a patient with Myotonic Dystrophy. This devastating disease is a repeat expansion disorder, caused by the extreme lengthening of short repeat array in the genome. Other diseases in this category include ALS, Huntington’s Disease, and Fragile-X disease. Current methods that do not utilize our Saphyr system cannot measure the length of such repeat arrays accurately. Saphyr’s ability to measure the normal and expanded repeat with unprecedented accuracy and detail on single molecules could help allow the development of better targeted tests and medicines.

Example: Greenwood Genetic Center 
Greenwood Genetic Center, based in South Carolina, has acquired Saphyr as part of a project to increase the diagnostic yield for patients with genetic disorders and cancer. As one of the first centers in the world to introduce next-generation sequencing in a diagnostic setting, Greenwood Genetic Center aims to introduce a lab developed test, or LDT, based on Saphyr. As such, a number of patients with a variety of birth defects and developmental disorders are being analyzed on Saphyr. 
In genetic disease, the standard of care consists usually of a combination of both phenotype-dependent targeted tests, and whole-genome analysis approaches. Targeted tests can consist of Multiple Ligation Probe Amplification, or MLPA, to test for the presence or absence of specific exons, PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of candidate genes and multiple FISH probes to pick up specific structural variants common to the expected disease. For whole genome approaches, first tier diagnostic tools include karyotyping techniques like metaphase chromosome spreads and in some cases microarrays. More recently, whole exome sequencing or whole genome sequencing are increasingly being introduced. 
A future workflow in which Saphyr replaces the large majority of FISH and MLPA tests for a genetics clinic such as Greenwood Genetic Center would rely on Saphyr to detect all structural variants larger than 500 base pairs, and on next-generation sequencing to detect all single nucleotide variants and other variants smaller than 500 base pairs. Since up to numerous FISH and MLPA tests are often performed, Saphyr’s single whole genome analysis provides a cost effective solution that saves significant amounts of time, labor and analysis in lieu of such tests. 
Oncology 
In cancer, each patient has a unique disease with a complex pattern of genome changes. Traditional and recently-developed treatments do not attack the individual changes in each patient’s tumor. Recent personalized medicine programs aim to provide clinicians with individual treatments specifically targeting the mutations found in each patient’s cancer. For personalized cancer medicine to be successful, all variants in the cancer genome need to be detected, which is not feasible with cytogenetic or whole genome sequencing approaches. The studies presented below demonstrate that Saphyr is critical for a complete understanding of a cancer genome, which is essential to enable truly targeted treatments. 
Example: Hematologic Malignancies 
In a study to be published in Nature Genetics, Dr. James Broach, Director of the Penn State Institute for Personalized Medicine, presented system’s ability to detect large rearrangements in leukemia, with a strong focus on translocations. In his research, our system detected all known translocations identified with standard clinical tools and, importantly, many structural variations never before identified in cancer, plus hundreds of structural variations that could not be seen by other methodologies. 
Attempts by Dr. Broach to detect translocations using next-generation sequencing were unsuccessful because of the large number of false positive translocation calls. Because of the highly repetitive nature of the human genome, many remote genomic regions have high sequence homology, and short-read sequencing often fails to correctly map reads to the correct genomic origin, leading to excessive false positive calls. The extremely long molecules that our system analyzes span long repetitive segments of sequence and can anchor sequences into the correct genomic context, leading to extremely few false positive calls. 
Given the high speed, low cost, industry-leading sensitivity and high reliability of our system displayed in this study, Dr. Broach showed evidence that our system is well positioned to eventually become the primary tool for clinical detection of genomic structural variation. 
Example: Prostate Cancer 
In a study published in Oncotarget, Dr. Vanessa Hayes at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Australia presented a complete tumor-normal comparison from a primary prostate cancer. Dr. Hayes’ team identified 85 large somatic deletions and insertions, of which half directly impact potentially oncogenic genes or regions. Only 11% of these large structural variations were detected using high-coverage, short-read next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analyses using a combination of the leading structural variation calling algorithms for next-generation sequencing data. Many structural variations detected with our system were flanked by repetitive sequences, making them undetectable to short-read sequencing. 
In subsequent studies presented at the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology annual meeting, Dr. Hayes detected several oncogenic driver mutations in metastasized prostate cancer samples. Several of the reported mutations were variants previously found in other cancer types but never before reported in prostate cancer, and for which effective treatments are available. Existing gene panels or FISH tests performed on cancer samples only test for expected variants. Our system’s whole genome analysis approach is the only molecular method that is capable of identifying all major structural variants in a cancer genome with sufficiently high sensitivity. To

make existing targeted cancer therapies more effective and to discover new ones, a complete characterization of the genome is important, making our system valuable in personalized cancer medicine. 
Our Products 
We develop and market the Saphyr system, a complete sample-to-result solution for structural variation analysis that empowers comprehensive genome analysis and facilitates a deeper understanding of genetic variation and function. We believe it is the only solution capable of addressing the needs for structural variation analysis because it is: 

• | Highly sensitive. We believe Saphyr is the most sensitive structural variation detector currently on the market in that it can identify structural variations that no other system can.


• | Highly specific. The structural variations found by Saphyr are found by direct observation rather than inference. Saphyr has a very low false positive rate, typically less than 2%.


• | Cost effective. We expect the cost per sample to continue to decline to less than $300 per sample in 2019 and less than $100 per sample in 2020.


• | Fast. Saphyr generates greater than 640 giga base pairs of information per day, on par with some of the faster short-read sequencers in the market. For highly sensitive structural variation detection, this allows Saphyr to process two human samples per day. We expect Saphyr’s throughput to increase to six per day by the first half of 2019 and 12 per day by the end of 2020. Over this same period, we expect to continuously improve the automation of sample prep and bioinformatics to help drive efficiencies of workflow.

Saphyr is being adopted across an extensive base of customers in world-class clinical, translational research, basic research, academic and governmental institutions as well as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We began marketing the Saphyr system in February 2017 after previously marketing Irys, our first-generation system, which was a slower system. We sell through a direct sales force and support organizations in North America and Europe, and through distribution partners in the Asia-Pacific and other regions of the world. We have sold more than 110 of our systems globally. We continually seek to expand our product offerings to meet the needs of our customers. 
When customers adopt the Saphyr system, they acquire one or more instruments, chips, reagents for DNA isolation and labeling and a suite of bioinformatics tools. The chips and reagents are used on a recurring basis. We also sell them ancillary solutions such as servers, reagents and other non-proprietary components used with the system. We designed Saphyr to accommodate performance upgrades without the need for replacement of the entire instrument. We intend for these performance enhancements to be delivered through software upgrades, purchased hardware upgrades and new chips and reagents. 
The Saphyr Instrument 
The Saphyr instrument is a single-molecule imager that includes high performance optics, automated sample loading based on machine learning algorithms and computational hardware and control software. The instrument’s high-performance optics simultaneously image DNA linearized in hundreds of thousands of nanochannels. The instrument’s control interface is the user’s primary control center to design and monitor experiments as they occur in real time. The computational hardware is responsible for the secondary processing of the image data being produced on the Saphyr.

The Saphyr instrument currently analyzes one Saphyr chip, containing up to two samples, per day with statistically relevant depth of coverage across each whole genome. An upgrade of the capability of the Saphyr instrument to process two chips, instead of one, per run is planned for the first half of 2019. This instrument upgrade along with the planned improvements to the chip mentioned below will enable Saphyr to process up to six human samples per day by the first half of 2019 and 12 per day by the end of 2020. 
The Saphyr Chip 
The Saphyr chip is the consumable that packages the nanochannel arrays for use in genome analysis. In its current form, each Saphyr chip has two flow cells. Each flow cell contains approximately 120,000 nanochannels that are roughly 50 nanometers wide and can hold a unique sample, which enables a researcher to analyze two samples per chip per day. We plan to offer a new chip to our customers in the first half of 2019 that will have three flow cells which, combined with the instrument upgrade mentioned above, will allow Saphyr to process six human samples per day. In 2020, we expect to offer a 12-flow cell version of the chip. The instrument at that time will be able to run two chips per run; however, given the increased processing load of the 12-flow cell chip relative to the three-flow cell chip, Saphyr is expected to take two days to process two 12-flow cell chips, thereby enabling a throughput of 12 samples per day in 2020. 

To manufacture the arrays, we use photolithography in a semiconductor fabrication facility to print hundreds of thousands of tiny grooves on silicon wafers and then dice the wafers into individual chips. Our chips are inexpensive to manufacture and highly scalable. The fluidic environment in each channel allows individual molecules to move swiftly utilizing only the charge of DNA. Our nanochannels allow only a single linearized molecule at a time to enter a given channel while preventing the molecule from tangling or folding back on itself. Importantly, hundreds of thousands of molecules can move through hundreds of thousands of parallel nanochannels simultaneously, enabling extremely high-throughput processing on a single-molecule basis. 
Saphyr Sample Prep and Labeling Kits 
Our Bionano Prep Kits™ and labeling kits provide the critical reagents and protocols needed to extract and label high molecular weight, or HMW, DNA for use with the Saphyr™ system. These kits are optimized for performing our genome mapping applications on a variety of sample types. 
Our workflow begins with the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. Our sample prep kits are optimized for isolating and purifying ultra-high molecular weight DNA in a process that is gentler than existing DNA extraction methods. The resulting purified DNA is millions of base pairs long and optimal for use with our systems. Each Bionano Prep Kit allows customers to perform five to 10 HMW DNA preps. Our kits and protocols enable the extraction of HMW DNA from a variety of sample types including soft or fibrous animal tissue, plant tissue, cell lines and human blood. 
Our labeling reagents are optimized for applications on our genome mapping systems. Starting with HMW DNA purified using the appropriate Bionano Prep Kit, fluorescent labels are attached to specific sequence motifs. The result is uniquely identifiable genome-specific label patterns that enable de novo map assembly, anchoring sequencing contigs and discovery of structural variations as small as 500 base pairs to up to chromosome arm lengths. 
Our newest and most powerful kit for DNA labeling, the Direct Label and Stain, or DLS, Kit is a proprietary, nondestructive chemistry for sequence motif labeling of genomic DNA that improves every aspect of our genome mapping. DLS uses a single direct-labeling enzymatic reaction to attach a fluorophore to the DNA at a specific 6-base pair sequence motif, yielding approximately 16 labels per 100,000 base pairs in the human genome. After labeling, the molecules are linearized in the Saphyr chip on the Saphyr instrument and imaged. Through the isolation, labeling and linearization steps, the molecules maintain an average length of around 250,000 base pairs. The label patterns on each molecule allow them to be uniquely identified and aligned in a pair-wise comparison against all other molecules imaged from the same sample.

Data Solutions 
Our data solutions offering includes a complete suite of hardware and software for end-to-end experiment management, algorithms for assembling genome maps and algorithms and databases for bioinformatics processing, all of which is driven through convenient web-based management and monitoring tools. 
Bionano Access is our web-based hub for Saphyr operations. It provides all the software that our customers need for experiment management and our structural variation analysis in one place. With Bionano Access our customers can: 

• | set up runs and monitor real-time data quality metrics remotely to flag potential sample quality issues early;


• | automatically start de novo assemblies and structural variation analysis when the desired amount of data has been collected;


• | visualize and manipulate maps and structural variants; and


• | analyze trios and clinical samples by filtering through uncommon variants to identify inherited and de novo variants, and export in a file format that is used consistently throughout the industry.

We have a suite of proprietary algorithms and databases that fully enable our proprietary bioinformatic and structural variation analysis pipelines. Using pairwise alignment of the single molecule images, consensus genome maps are constructed, refined, extended and merged. Molecules are then clustered into two alleles, and a diploid assembly is created to allow for heterozygous structural variation detection. Genome maps typically span entire chromosome arms in single, contiguous maps. Comparative analysis of maps reveals structural variation. Our customers use our variant annotation workflow to specifically uncover rare and sample-specific mutations. For example, to help a customer determine genomic variant frequency in a tumor, Saphyr compares the cancer sample structural calls against over 600,000 structural variations from over 160 humans with no evidence of diseases. To identify somatic mutations, the workflow can run comparisons of the tumor specimen against a control sample to determine whether the cancer mutations are present in low abundance among the control’s genome. Using this high through-put pipeline approach we can efficiently focus on dozens of clinically significant structural candidates for further analysis. 
Our hardware solution includes the Saphyr Compute Server, which provides offers cluster-like performance in an affordable, compact solution and the Bionano Compute Server, which expands the analytical capacity of the suite of tools. With these solutions, our customers are capable of performing multiple simultaneous analyses and sustaining continuous throughput, which allows them to spend less time waiting for data, so they can focus on investigating results. We also offer a cloud-based solution for data analysis.

The Saphyr System’s Industry-Leading Sensitivity and Specificity 
Our Saphyr system detects structural variations that Illumina’s systems miss. As shown in the graphic below, the Garvan Institute of Medical Research generated data that we expect to be published which shows the density of structural variations found relative to the size of the structural variation found for our system (blue lines) against next-generation sequencing (Illumina; orange lines). Next-generation sequencing has a very significant deficiency in detecting structural variations. Given our system’s ability to detect structural variations, it picks up essentially where next-generation sequencing drops off, as shown below.
Retaining long-range contiguity throughout the genome mapping process is critical for any comprehensive study of genome structure and function, particularly for the analysis of structural variation in complex genomes. Saphyr offers unmatched sensitivity for the detection of large structural variations greater than 500 base pairs. Saphyr’s specific sensitivity percentages from recent studies are shown below: 

• | 99% sensitivity for homozygous insertions/deletions larger than 500 base pairs;


• | 95% sensitivity for heterozygous insertions/deletions larger than 500 base pairs;


• | 95% sensitivity for balanced and unbalanced translocations larger than 50,000 base pairs;


• | 99% sensitivity for inversions larger than 30,000 base pairs;


• | 97% sensitivity for duplications larger than 30,000 base pairs; and


• | 97% sensitivity for copy number variants larger than 500,000 base pairs.

13

A study of Pacific Biosciences’ long-read sequencing’s ability to detect homozygous and heterozygous insertions and deletions was published recently. The sensitivity to detect homozygous structural variations using Pacific Biosciences was 87%, compared to 99% using Saphyr. The sensitivity to detect heterozygous structural variations using Pacific Biosciences was only 41%, which is less than half the 84% sensitivity for heterozygous structural variation detection using Saphyr. Even when the Pacific Biosciences structural variation calls were limited to insertions and deletions larger than 500 base pairs, the sensitivity for homozygous structural variations was only 81%, and for heterozygous structural variations was only 49%. 
Saphyr detects duplications over 30,000 base pairs, in direct or inverse orientation, with a sensitivity of 97%. Saphyr detects 99% of inversions of that same size range. Inversions are the invisible variants and have traditionally been the hardest to detect structural events. They are balanced, without gain or loss of sequence, and unlike translocations they do not create easily visible changes in genomic context. Inversions often escape detection by traditional cytogenetic techniques. Chromosomal microarrays cannot identify balanced events, and metaphase chromosome spreads can only visualize some megabase-size inversions. Next-generation sequencing approaches tend to miss inversions because reads from inside the inversion tend to map back to the reference without any indication that the orientation of the sequence has changed. Detection of the breakpoints often fails, especially if the inversion is flanked by segmental duplications, repeat sequences or other non-unique sequences. Saphyr’s imaging of extremely long molecules overcomes these obstacles to identifying inversions. 
In a separate study, our system detected seven times more structural variations larger than 5,000 base pairs compared to next-generation sequencing. Dr. Pui-Yan Kwok at the University of California, San Francisco, demonstrated the robustness of our system for genome-wide discovery of structural variations in a trio from the 1000 Genomes Project. Using our system, hundreds of insertions, deletions, and inversions greater than 5,000 base pairs were uncovered amounting to 7.3 times more than the large structural variation events detected by next-generation sequencing. Importantly, many of the structural variations that were found were in regions believed to contain functional elements leading to disruption of gene function or regulation. 
Our Strengths 
We have established ourselves as one of the leaders in the field of genome analysis, and we believe we are the industry’s performance leader in structural variation detection. Below are our strengths that we believe will enable us to capture a significant portion of the genome analysis market and retain our leadership position in structural variation: 

• | Highly differentiated technology platform enables researchers and clinicians to obtain information that cannot be had systematically and cost efficiently from traditional technologies. Saphyr’s unique ability to systematically and cost efficiently see structural variations across the genome from 500 base pairs to tens of millions of base pairs is unique in the industry. We believe this greater insight will facilitate a paradigm shift in healthcare from an emphasis on treatment with

14

relatively untargeted therapies to a focus on earlier detection, more precise diagnosis and treatment with better targeted therapies. 

• | Validated solution recognized industry-wide. We have deep and expanding scientific validation. Our system has been cited in hundreds of publications, and we believe our technology is becoming a vital tool in cutting-edge life sciences research.


• | Strong installed base of premier customers. We have sold more than 110 of our systems globally. Our customers include some of the world’s most prominent clinical, translational research, basic research, academic and government institutions as well as leading pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies. Examples include Examples include Children’s National Health System, DuPont Pioneer, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Genentech, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Pennsylvania State University and Salk Institute for Biological Studies.


• | Attractive business model with a growing, high-margin recurring revenue component. As we continue to grow our installed base of Saphyr systems, optimize workflows and expand our structural variation detection capabilities, we expect to rapidly increase our high-margin revenues derived from consumables. The successful integration of our technology into our customers’ projects provides ongoing sales of assays and consumables.


• | Industry-leading intellectual property portfolio. We have developed a global patent portfolio that includes 43 issued patents across 14 patent families and an exclusively licensed portfolio of patents and applications from Princeton University, which includes 22 patents across two families. This global patent portfolio has filing dates ranging from 2001 to 2017. We have robust intellectual property protection surrounding our devices, systems, and methods for macromolecular analysis. Our ideation stems from our highly active research programs and results in our patent portfolio continually expanding at a significant pace.


• | Highly experienced senior management team. We are led by a dedicated and highly experienced senior management team with significant industry experience and proven ability to develop novel solutions. Each of the members of our senior management has more than 20 years of relevant experience.

Our Strategy 
Our goal is to enable new research in genomics to allow greater insight into their role in human health in ways that have not been possible with any other current research and diagnostic technologies. 
Our strategy to achieve this includes: 

• | Drive adoption of Saphyr in discovery research and cytogenetics markets. Saphyr has the potential to significantly expand the life science research market and genomics-based diagnostics market because of its unrivaled sensitivity, by enabling researchers to perform studies on structural variations that they were previously unable to perform. We believe Saphyr has the capability to enable the development of a new category of diagnostic tests and tools.


• | Support the publication of findings with Saphyr by our customers beyond the over 130 papers published to date. The chart below shows the annual number of publications released since 2010 which featured data generated by Saphyr and its predecessor system. Recently, the overall number of these publications has grown significantly. For example, of the over 130 papers published to date, approximately half were published in 2017 alone. We will continue to support and foster our customer base to help grow the number of publications featuring our systems’ data. We believe that these publications are impactful as our customers’ studies cover structural variations in areas of high unmet medical need, such as rare and undiagnosed pediatric diseases, muscular diseases, developmental delays and disorders, prostate cancer and leukemia.


• | Expand gross margins through economies of scale and growing sales of consumables. Our overall gross margin has historically been driven by our instrument gross margin as the sales of our instruments have constituted the vast majority

15

of our total revenues to date. Our instrument gross margin is significantly lower than our consumables gross margin. We expect our overall gross margin to expand in 2019 and beyond as: 

◦ | We further negotiate with silicon fabrication manufacturers for better contract pricing of our consumables. As our manufacturing lot volumes increase, we expect to have lower costs of goods sold. This is driven by the pass along of some of the economies of scale of contract manufacturers that mainly operate in the ultra-high-volume silicon computer chip industry.


◦ | Consumables sales continue to represent the fastest growing component of overall revenues. As consumables growth continues to outpace instrument growth, we expect the proportion of our product mix which is higher gross margin to increase, thereby expanding our overall gross margin.


• | Continue to innovate our products and technologies. We designed Saphyr to accommodate performance enhancements without the need for replacement of the entire instrument. For example, hardware upgrades and new consumables are made available to purchase by customers. We intend for these performance enhancements to be delivered on a regular basis. In addition, we periodically make available software upgrades to customers through download at no charge. We will continue to develop and refine our technologies to improve the ease of use of our Saphyr system and enable our existing installed systems to meaningfully increase sample throughput and sensitivity and specificity of structural variation detection.


• | Partner with industry-leading companies and laboratories to accelerate adoption in clinical markets. Establish additional collaborations with customers to help drive validating studies. Expand partnership efforts with clinical diagnostic companies to commercialize LDTs in the U.S. as well as LDTs and approved tests outside the U.S.

Sales and Marketing 
Our commercial team includes 16 individuals, including seven salespeople, two marketing personnel, and seven sales support personnel, including customer solutions personnel, field specialists and application specialists. 

This commercial staff is primarily located in North America and Europe. Most of our sales support team is located at our headquarters in San Diego and some work remotely throughout the U.S., Europe and China. 
We sell our products through a direct sales force in North America and Europe. Our sales strategy involves the use of a combination of sales managers, sales representatives and field application specialists. Our direct sales force includes four salespeople located in the U.S. and three located in Europe. We expect to increase our sales force as we expand our business. 
We sell our products through a network of distributors in the Asia-Pacific region and select other markets outside of North America and Europe. Specifically, we distribute our instruments and reagents via third-party distributors in markets such as China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Australia, India and South Africa. Four of our distributors are in China, one in Australia, one in Japan and one in South Korea. 
The role of our sales managers and sales representatives is to educate customers on the advantages of Saphyr and the applications that our system makes possible. The role of our field application specialists is to provide on-site training and scientific technical support to prospective and existing customers. Our field application specialists are technical experts with advanced degrees, including four with Ph.D.s, and generally have extensive experience in academic research and core sequencing lab experience. 
In addition, we maintain an applications lab team in San Diego, California composed of scientific experts who can transfer knowledge from the research and development team to the field application specialists. The applications lab team also runs foundational scientific collaborations and proof of principle studies, which help demonstrate the value of our product offering to prospective customers. 
Our domestic and international sales force informs our current and potential customers of current product offerings, new product and new assay introductions, and technological advances in Saphyr systems, workflows, and notable research being performed by our customers or ourselves. As our primary point of contact in the marketplace, our sales force focuses on delivering a consistent marketing message and high level of customer service, while also attempting to help us better understand evolving market and customer needs. 
16

We intend to significantly expand our sales, support, and marketing efforts in the future by expanding our direct footprint in North America and Europe as well as developing a more comprehensive support network in China where significant market opportunities exist. Additionally, we believe that there is significant opportunity in other European, South American, Asia-Pacific and Middle Eastern regions. We plan to expand into these regions via initial penetration with distributors. 
Our sales and marketing efforts are targeted at key opinion leaders, laboratory directors and principal investigators at leading translational research, clinical institutions, governmental research institutions and pharmaceutical companies. In addition to our selling activities, we align with key opinion leaders at leading institutions and clinical research laboratories to help increase scientific and commercial awareness of our technology, demonstrate its benefits relative to existing technologies and accelerate its adoption. We also seek to increase awareness of our products through participation at trade shows, academic conferences, online webinars and dedicated scientific events attended by prominent users and prospective customers. 
Our systems are relatively new to the life science marketplace and require a capital investment by our customers. The sales process typically involves numerous interactions and demonstrations with multiple people within an organization. Some potential customers conduct in-depth evaluations of the system including having us run experiments on in-house Saphyr systems. In addition, in most countries, sales to academic or governmental institutions require participation in a tender process involving preparation of extensive documentation and a lengthy review process. Because of these factors and the budget cycles of our customers, our sales cycle, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order, can often be nine to 12 months. 
Manufacturing and Supply 
Our manufacturing strategy is to outsource instrument and chip manufacturing and internally develop and assemble reagent kits in our own facility. 
Instruments 
Our Saphyr instrument is manufactured by a third party medical device manufacturer. Nearly complete Saphyr instruments are shipped by the manufacturer to us for final assembly and quality control testing. Upon completion, we ship directly to our customers’ locations globally, or distributors’ locations in the case of certain systems sold in the Asia-Pacific region. Installation of, and training on, our products is provided by our employees in the markets where we conduct direct sales, and by distributors in those markets where we operate with distributors. 
We believe this manufacturing strategy is efficient and conserves capital. However, in the event it becomes necessary to utilize a different contract manufacturer for Saphyr, we would experience additional costs, delays and difficulties in doing so, and our business could be harmed. 
This manufacturer actively manages obsolescence of all components in our system. This is done through their supply management process where we get notified of any parts that will become obsolete with enough lead time to identify alternatives. 
Consumables 
All of our chip consumables are produced by a third party manufacturer at its facility; however, we have established procedures for a replacement manufacturer if required. We complete final assembly and quality control assessments of our chips at our headquarters in San Diego. 
Our reagents are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, including certain single source suppliers. Reagents include all components required to run a sample on Saphyr, such as capture and detector reagents, enzyme reagents and enzyme substrate. Although we believe that alternatives would be available, it would take time to identify and validate replacement reagents for our assay kits, which 
17

could negatively affect our ability to supply assay kits on a timely basis. Reagents are supplied through a single source supplier. This supplier requires a sufficient notification period to allow for supply continuity and the identification and technology transfer to a new supplier in the event either party wishes to terminate the relationship. 
We actively manage component obsolescence by subscribing to our vendors’ end-of-life notifications. If a vendor is unable to provide sufficient notification, we keep safety stock of the component to minimize disruption to operations. 
Key Agreements 
License Agreement with Princeton University 
In January 2004, we entered into a license agreement, or the License Agreement, with Princeton University, or Princeton. Pursuant to the License Agreement, we received a worldwide, exclusive right and license to, among other things, manufacture and market products or services utilizing patents and inventions related to our sample preparation, DNA imaging and genomic data analysis platform and other key technology. 
We are obligated to pay Princeton an annual license maintenance fee in the mid-four digits, which can be reduced by royalties paid to Princeton during the preceding 12 month period. We are also obligated to make royalty payments to Princeton equal to (i) a percentage in the mid-single digits of our and any of our sub-licensees’ net sales of products covered by the License Agreement and (ii) a percentage in the low-single digits of our and any of our sub-licensees’ revenue from services covered by the License Agreement. Our royalty obligations continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and licensed service-by-licensed service basis, in every country of the world, until the later of the last sale of a licensed product or service or the expiration of all Princeton patent rights. 
The term of the License Agreement will continue until all of our royalty payment obligations have expired, unless terminated earlier. Princeton may terminate the License Agreement upon written notice in the event of our material breach of the License Agreement if such breach remains uncured for 60 days. We may terminate the License Agreement without cause upon 60 days’ advance written notice to Princeton. 
Agreement for the Manufacture of Our Instruments 
We have engaged a single third party manufacturer to produce and test our instruments on an as-ordered basis. The manufacturer of our instruments has no obligation to manufacture our instruments without a purchase order. In addition, this manufacturer has no obligation to maintain inventory in excess of any open purchase orders or materials in excess of the amount it reasonably determines will be consumed within 90 days. We are obligated to purchase any material deemed in excess pursuant to the agreement. The price we pay is determined according to a mutually agreed-upon pricing formula. We may terminate a purchase order by giving the manufacturer at least 30 days’ written notice. 
Agreement for the Manufacture of Our Chip Consumables 
We have engaged a single third party manufacturer to manufacture our chip consumables used in our Saphyr system and provide engineering services to us. This third party has no obligation to manufacture our chip consumables without a purchase order. The prices and fees we pay are established in our agreement with this manufacturer or determined by the manufacturer pursuant if supported by appropriate information. Our agreement with this manufacturer automatically renews for successive one year terms unless a party notifies the other party in writing at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term. We may terminate an order of the agreement at any time upon 30 days’ written notice. 
Berry Genomics Agreement 
We have entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Berry Agreement, with Berry Genomics Co., Ltd, or Berry. Under the terms of the Berry Agreement, Berry agreed to develop, market and commercialize a Berry-branded in-vitro diagnostic, or IVD, system (which is comprised of both kits and instruments) in the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC, in certain specified fields, as well as for clinical use by its partners. Pursuant to the Berry Agreement, Berry agreed to purchase certain of our components for use exclusively within the kits and instruments that make up the IVD system. Berry is then responsible for manufacturing the finished system, as well as for obtaining regulatory approvals for the sale of our components in the PRC. Per the Berry Agreement, we are obligated to provide the necessary support and documentation for the components, as well as provide training to enable Berry’s after-sales installation and support for the IVD system. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Berry Agreement, we granted to Berry and its affiliates, an irrevocable, exclusive, sublicensable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, license during the term of the agreement, solely to seek and obtain CFDA registration, manufacture, market, distribute and sell IVD kits and IVD instruments. We also have the right to all IVD system improvements. We have the first right, but not obligation, 
18

to take any measures we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights. We also agree to provide reasonable assistance related to such enforcement actions as Berry may request at the cost and expenses of Berry. 
The Berry Agreement may be renewed by either party upon 90 days written notice and subject to the negotiation of an agreement facilitating such renewal. Either party may terminate the agreement for a material breach if such breach remains uncured for 30 days, or immediately if the breach is not curable. We may also immediately terminate the Berry Agreement if Berry fails to fulfill its minimum quantity purchase requirements. 
Intellectual Property 
Our core technology for nucleic acid research is related to methods and devices for non-sequencing based analysis of macromolecules such as nucleic acids. Using this technology, long (high-molecular weight) nucleic acids can be suitably labeled and elongated in order to ascertain structural information such as scaffold organization, copy number, and de novo analysis of genomic repeats that is not readily obtained with current sequencing-based approaches. We have secured and continue to pursue intellectual property rights globally, including rights related to analysis of nucleic acid molecules, as well as innovations in the molecular biology and bioinformatics spaces. 
We have developed a global patent portfolio that includes 43 issued patents across 14 patent families and an exclusively licensed portfolio of patents and applications from Princeton University, which includes 22 patents across two families. This global patent portfolio has filing dates ranging from 2001 to 2017. The owned and licensed families contain issued patents and pending applications that relate to devices, systems, and methods for macromolecular analysis, and reflect our active and ongoing research programs. The commercial foci of these patent families are discussed below. 

Commercial Focus | Number of Issued and Pending Patents
Nanochannel devices and systems | 70 
Methods of macromolecule analysis using nanochannel arrays | 62 
Methods of genetic detection and copy number analysis | 28 
Method of genomic sequence and epigenomic analysis. | 48 
Biomolecule isolation and processing for use in nanochannel analysis | 3 
Method of optimizing nanochannel analysis | 6 
Next-generation products | 11 

In addition to pursuing patents, we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, as applicable, our advisors. 
Government Regulation
Our products are currently intended for research use only, or RUO, applications, although our customers may use our products to develop their own products that are subject to regulation by the FDA. Although most products intended for RUO are not currently subject to clearance or approval by the FDA, RUO products fall under the FDA’s jurisdiction if they are used for clinical rather than research purposes. Consequently, our products are labeled “For Research Use Only.” 

The FDA’s 2013 Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff on “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only,” or, the RUO/IUO Guidance, provides the FDA’s thinking on when IVD products are properly labeled for RUO or for IUO. The RUO/IUO Guidance explains that the FDA will review the totality of the circumstances when evaluating whether equipment and testing components are properly labeled as RUO. Merely including a labeling statement that a product is intended for research use only will not necessarily exempt the device from the FDA’s 510(k) clearance, premarket approval, or other requirements, if the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer intends its product to be used for clinical diagnostic use. These circumstances may include written or verbal marketing claims or links to articles regarding a product’s performance in clinical applications, a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for clinical validation or clinical applications, or solicitation of business from clinical laboratories, all of which could be considered evidence of intended uses that conflict with RUO labeling. 
When marketed for clinical diagnostic use, our products will be regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA defines a medical device in part as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article which is intended for the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man. FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, marketing, post-market surveillance, distribution, advertising and labeling of medical devices. The FDA also requires the device to be registered by the medical device manufacturer and listed as marketed product. 
19

The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes on the basis of the intended use of the device, the risk associated with the use of the device for that indication, as determined by the FDA, and on the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices, which have the lowest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls and premarket approval. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from a requirement that the manufacturer submit a premarket notification, or 510(k), and receive clearance from the FDA which is otherwise a premarketing requirement for a Class II device. Class III devices may not be commercialized until a premarket approval application, or PMA, is submitted to and approved by the FDA. 
510(k) Clearance Pathway 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a sponsor must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent, or SE, to a device legally marketed in the U.S. for which a PMA was not required. The FDA is supposed to make a SE determination within 90 days of FDA’s receipt of the 510(k), but it often takes longer if the FDA requests additional information. Most 510(k)s do not require supporting data from clinical trials, but the FDA may request such data. 
Premarket Approval Pathway 
A PMA must be submitted if a new device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is generally more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the accepted application, although, review of the application generally can take between one and three years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with its quality system regulations, or QSRs. New premarket approval applications or premarket approval application supplements are also required for product modifications that affect the safety and efficacy of the device. 
Clinical Trials 
Clinical trials are usually required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for a 510(k). In the U.S., if the device is determined to present a “significant risk,” the manufacturer may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an investigational device exemption application, or IDE, and obtains approval of the IDE from the FDA. These clinical trials are also subject to the review, approval and oversight of an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site. The clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations and good clinical practices. A clinical trial may be suspended by FDA, the sponsor or an IRB at its institution at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the trial. Even if a clinical trial is completed, the results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a device to the satisfaction of the FDA, or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of a device. 
After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include among other things: 

• | compliance with QSRs, which require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, record maintenance, including maintenance of complaint and related investigation files, and other quality assurance controls during the manufacturing process;


• | reporting of device malfunctions, serious injuries or deaths;


• | registration of the establishments where the devices are produced;


• | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved uses; and


• | medical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers investigate and report to the FDA adverse events, including deaths, or serious injuries that may have been or were caused by a medical device and malfunctions in the device that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions, including but not limited to, warning letters; fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of the device; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new devices; withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals; and civil or criminal prosecution. To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA.

Laboratories that purchase certain of our products and perform clinical diagnostic testing are also subject to extensive regulation under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, requiring clinical laboratories to meet specified standards in areas such as personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. Adverse interpretations of current CLIA regulations or future changes in CLIA regulations could have an adverse effect on sales of any affected products. Moreover, if we decide to operate our own clinical testing laboratory, we will be required to comply with CLIA. If, in the future, we operate our own clinical laboratory to perform clinical diagnostic testing, we would become subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as well as additional federal and state laws that impose a variety of fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories. 
Laboratory Developed Tests 
Although the FDA has statutory authority to regulate medical devices, the FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the FDC Act and FDA regulations with respect to laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, which are a subset of in vitro diagnostic tests that are intended for clinical use and designed, manufactured and used entirely within a single laboratory. The FDA does not consider devices to be LDTs if they are designed or manufactured completely, or partly, outside of the laboratory that offers and uses them. We sell our Saphyr system on an RUO basis to CLIA certified cytogenetics laboratories, which may use the system to develop LDTs.
At various times since 2006, the FDA has issued documents outlining its intent to require varying levels of FDA oversight of many types of LDTs. In October 2014, the FDA issued draft guidance that sets forth a proposed risk-based regulatory framework that would apply such oversight to LDTs. The FDA has indicated that it does not intend to implement its proposed framework until the draft guidance documents are finalized. It is unclear at this time if or when the FDA will finalize its plans to end enforcement discretion for LDTs, and even then, whether the new regulatory requirements are expected to be phased-in over time. However, the FDA may decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time. A significant change in the way that the FDA regulates any LDTs that we, our collaborators or our customers develop using our technology could affect our business. If the FDA requires laboratories to undergo premarket review and comply with other applicable FDA requirements in the future, the cost and time required to commercialize an LDT will increase substantially, and may reduce the financial incentive for laboratories to develop LDTs, which could reduce demand for our instruments and our other products. In addition, if the FDA were to change the way that it regulates LDTs to require that we undergo pre-market review or comply with other applicable FDA requirements before we can sell our instruments or our other products to clinical cytogenics laboratories, our ability to sell our instruments and other products to this addressable market would be delayed, thereby impeding our ability to penetrate this market and generate revenue from sales of our instruments and our other products. 
Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of our product for clinical diagnostic use in those countries. The regulations in other jurisdictions vary from those in the U.S. and may be easier or more difficult to satisfy and are subject to change. For example, the European Union recently published new regulations that will result in greater regulation of medical devices and IVDs. The IVD Regulation is significantly different from the IVD Directive that it replaces in that it will ensure that the new requirements apply uniformly and on the same schedule across the member states, include a risk-based classification system and increase the requirements for conformity assessment. The conformity assessment process results in the receipt of a CE designation which has been sufficient to begin marketing many types of IVDs. That process will become more difficult and costly to complete. 
Other Governmental Regulation 
We are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the U.S. Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. We generally use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials that we may use during our research.
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Currently, our product is for research use only, but clinical laboratories may acquire our instrumentation through a capital purchase or capital lease and use the Saphyr and direct label stain chemistry to create their own potentially reimbursable products, such as laboratory developed tests for in vitro diagnostics. Our customers may generate revenue for these testing services by seeking the necessary approval 
21

of their product from the FDA or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, along with coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health programs and private health plans. The ability of our customers to commercialize diagnostic tests based on our technology will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these tests will be available from such third-party payors. 
In the U.S., molecular testing laboratories have multiple options for reimbursement coding, but we expect that the primary codes used will be the genomic sequencing procedure codes, or GSPs. The American Medical Association, or AMA, added GSPs to its clinical laboratory fee schedule in 2015. In addition, CMS recently issued a coverage determination providing for the reimbursement of next-generation sequencing for certain cancer diagnostics using an FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic test. Private health plans often follow CMS coverage and reimbursement guidelines to a substantial degree, and it is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement of any products our customers try to commercialize. 
In Europe, coverage for molecular diagnostic testing is varied. Countries with statutory health insurance (e.g., Germany, France, The Netherlands) tend to be more progressive in technology adoption with favorable reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing. In countries such as the United Kingdom with tax-based insurance, adoption and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing is not uniform and is influenced by local budgets. 
Ultimately, coverage and reimbursement of new products is uncertain, and whether laboratories that use our instruments to develop their own products will attain coverage and adequate reimbursement is unknown. In the U.S., there is no uniform policy for determining coverage and reimbursement. Coverage can differ from payor to payor, and the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement. 
Healthcare Reform 
In the U.S. and abroad, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs and change the way healthcare is financed. By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, became law. The ACA is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The ACA’s provisions of importance to our business include, but are not limited to, a 2.3% excise tax on certain entities that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the U.S., which has been suspended, but due to subsequent legislative amendments, will be automatically reinstated for medical device sales beginning January 1, 2020, unless Congress takes additional action to delay the implementation of the tax. 
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA, such as removing penalties, effective January 1, 2019, for not comploying with the ACA's individual mandate to carry heal and insurance and delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees including, without limitation, the medical device excise tax. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the "individual mandate" was repealed by Congress as part of Legislation enacted in 2017 (H.R. 1, "An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018"), informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
Further, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, on April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, was signed into law, which, among other things, significantly altered the payment methodology under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS. PAMA requires certain laboratories performing clinical diagnostic laboratory tests to report to CMS the amounts paid by private payors for laboratory tests. Beginning on January 1, 2018, CMS has begun using reported private payor pricing to periodically revise payment rates under the CLFS. 
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services. In addition, sales of our tests outside of the U.S. will subject us to foreign regulatory requirements, which may also change over time.

Other Healthcare Laws 
Our operations are directly or indirectly, through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal and state anti-kickback statutes and false claims laws. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales and marketing and education programs, and our financial and business relationships with researchers who use our instruments to develop marketed products. By way of example: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item, or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program; and the federal false claims laws, including, without limitation the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to the federal government (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursement for, among other things, drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. The ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a crime. In addition, the ACA clarifies that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or service resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
In addition, we may be subject to HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers and their business associates who create, use or disclose individually identifiable health information on their behalf. We may also be subject to state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, additional integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, contractual damages, and reputational harm. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 77 employees, of which 33 work in sales, sales support and marketing, 31 work in research and development, six work in manufacturing and operations and seven work in general and administrative. As of December 31, 2018, of our 77 employees, 67 were located in the U.S. and 10 were employed outside the U.S. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 
Facilities 
We lease approximately 16,521 square feet of office, laboratory, and manufacturing space at our headquarters in San Diego, California, under a lease that expires on December 31, 2020. We believe that we will need additional space as we grow our operations, but believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available to accommodate future growth of our business. We believe that our existing office, laboratory and manufacturing space will be sufficient to meet our needs in the interim. 
Corporate Information
We were formed in January 2003 as BioNanomatrix LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. In August 2007, we became BioNanomatrix Inc., a Delaware corporation. In October 2011, we changed our name to BioNano Genomics, Inc., and in July 2018, we changed our name to Bionano Genomics, Inc. 
Our principal executive offices are located at 9540 Towne Centre Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, and our telephone number is (858) 888-7600. Our website address is www.bionanogenomics.com. Information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report, and you should not consider information on our website to be part of this Annual Report. Our design logo, “Bionano,” and our other registered and common law trade names, trademarks and service marks are the property of Bionano Genomics, Inc. 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We may take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including not being required to have our internal control over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
23

Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments. We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier. In particular, in this Annual Report, we have provided only two years of audited financial statements and have not included all of the executive compensation related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. 
In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different transition dates for public and private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our timeline to comply with these standards will in many cases be delayed as compared to other public companies that are not eligible to take advantage of this election or have not made this election. Therefore, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with the public company effective dates for these standards.
