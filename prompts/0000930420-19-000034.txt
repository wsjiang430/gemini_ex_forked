ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company Overview 
Kforce Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Kforce”) provide professional staffing services and solutions to clients through the following segments: Technology (“Tech”); Finance and Accounting (“FA”); and Government Solutions (“GS”). Kforce provides staffing services and solutions on both a temporary (“Flex”) and permanent (“Direct Hire”) basis. We operate through our corporate headquarters in Tampa, Florida with approximately 60 field offices located throughout the U.S. Kforce was incorporated in 1994 but its predecessor companies have been providing staffing services since 1962. Kforce completed its Initial Public Offering in August 1995.
Kforce serves clients across many industries and geographies as well as companies of all sizes with a particular focus on Fortune 1000 and similarly-sized companies. We also provide services and solutions as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. Federal Government (the “Federal Government”) as well as state and local governments. We believe that our portfolio of service offerings is focused in areas of expected growth and are a key contributor to our long-term financial stability. Our 10 largest clients represented approximately 25% of revenue and no single client accounted for more than 5% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Substantially all of our revenues are derived from U.S. domestic operations. The asset sale of Kforce Global Solutions, Inc., (“Global”) a wholly-owned subsidiary located in the Philippines, was completed in September 2017. This sale did not meet the definition of discontinued operations. Global was included in our Tech segment and contributed approximately 1% of revenue in 2017 and 2016. 
Our quarterly operating results can be affected by:

• | the number of billing days in a particular quarter;


• | the seasonality of our clients’ businesses;


• | increased holidays and vacation days taken, which is usually highest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year; and


• | increased costs as a result of certain annual U.S. state and federal employment tax resets that occur at the beginning of each calendar year, which negatively impacts our gross profit and overall profitability in the first fiscal quarter of each calendar year.

The following charts depict the percentage of our total revenue for each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:
For additional segment financial data see Note 2 – “Reportable Segments” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Tech Segment
Our largest segment, Tech, provides both Flex and Direct Hire services to our clients, focusing primarily on areas of information technology such as systems/applications architecture and development, project management, enterprise data management, business intelligence, artificial intelligence, machine learning, network architecture and security. Within our Tech segment, we provide service to clients in a variety of industries with a strong footprint in the financial services, communications and insurance services and also to Federal government integrators. Revenue for our Tech segment increased 9.1% to $990.1 million in 2018 on a year-over-year basis. The average bill rate for our Tech segment in 2018 was approximately $73 per hour. 
The September 2018 report published by Staffing Industry Analysts (“SIA”) stated that temporary technology staffing is expected to experience growth of 3% in 2019. Digital transformation, as a general trend, is driving organizations across all industries to increase their technology investments as competition and the speed of change intensifies. Nontraditional competitors are also entering new end markets; thus, putting increased pressure on companies to invest in innovation and the evolution of their business models. We believe these secular drivers will transcend traditional cyclical patterns as our clients' business models adjust. At the macro level, demand is also being driven by an ever-changing and complex regulatory and employment law environment, which increases the overall cost of employment for many companies. These factors, among others, are continuing to drive companies to look to temporary staffing providers, such as Kforce, to meet their human capital needs.
FA Segment
Our FA segment provides both Flex and Direct Hire services to our clients in areas such as general accounting, business analysis, accounts payable, accounts receivable, financial analysis and reporting, taxation, budget preparation and analysis, mortgage and loan processing, cost analysis, professional administration, outsourced functional support, credit and collections, audit services and systems and controls analysis and documentation. Within our FA segment, we provide services to clients in a variety of industries with a strong footprint in the financial services, healthcare and government sectors. Revenue for our FA segment decreased 9.3% to $313.8 million in 2018 on a year-over-year basis. The average bill rate for our FA segment in 2018 was approximately $35 per hour. The September 2018 report published by SIA stated that finance and accounting temporary staffing is expected to experience growth of 4% in 2019.
GS Segment
Our GS segment provides staffing services and solutions to the Federal Government as both a prime contractor and a subcontractor in the fields of information technology and finance and accounting. GS offers integrated business solutions to its clients in areas including but not limited to: information technology infrastructure transformation, healthcare informatics, data and knowledge management and analytics, research and development, audit readiness, financial management and accounting. GS contracts are concentrated among clients, such as the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, and the types of services and support that have historically been less likely to be impacted by sequestration threats and budget constraints, though a prolonged government shutdown could be expected to negatively impact GS revenue. Revenue for our GS segment increased 9.7% to $114.4 million in 2018. Our GS segment also includes a product business specialized in manufacturing and delivering trauma-training manikins, which accounted for approximately 14% of total GS revenue in 2018. The majority of GS services are supplied to the Federal Government (or through a prime contractor to the Federal Government) through field offices located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and San Antonio and Austin, Texas. 
Our backlog represents only those U.S. government contracts and subcontracts for which funding has been provided, excluding renewal option years. Our backlog was $47.4 million as of December 31, 2018 as compared to $59.3 million as of December 31, 2017.
Flex Revenue
Flex revenue represents approximately 96% of total revenue over the last three fiscal years. We provide our clients with qualified individuals (“consultants”) on a temporary basis when it is determined that they have the appropriate skills and experience and are the right match for our clients. We utilize a diversified set of recruitment platforms and databases to identify consultants who are actively seeking employment. These consultants can either be directly employed by Kforce, qualified independent contractors or foreign nationals sponsored by Kforce. Our success is dependent upon our internal employees’ (“associates”) ability to: (1) acknowledge, understand and participate in creating solutions for our clients’ needs; (2) determine and understand the experience and capabilities of the consultants being recruited; and (3) ensure excellence in delivering and managing the client-consultant relationship. We believe proper execution by our associates and consultants directly impacts the longevity of the assignments, increases the likelihood of generating repeat business with our clients and fosters a better experience for our consultants, which has a direct correlation to their redeployment.
The key drivers of Flex revenue are the number of consultant assignments and billable hours, the bill rate per hour and, to a limited extent, the amount of billable expenses incurred by Kforce. Our Flex gross profit is determined by deducting related costs of employment for consultants, including compensation, payroll taxes, certain fringe benefits and subcontractor costs from Flex revenue. Associate and field management compensation, payroll taxes and other fringe benefits are included in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”), along with other customary costs such as administrative and corporate costs. The Flex business model involves attempting to maximize the number of billable hours and bill rates, while managing consultant pay rates and benefit costs, as well as compensation and benefits for our associates.
Direct Hire Revenue
Our Direct Hire business involves locating qualified individuals (“candidates”) for permanent placement with our clients. Direct Hire revenue represents less than 4% of total revenue over the last three fiscal years; although it is a smaller portion of our business, it continues to be an important capability in ensuring that we can meet the talent needs of our clients through whatever means they prefer. We recruit candidates using methods that are consistent with Flex consultants. Candidate searches are generally performed on a contingency basis (as opposed to a retained search), therefore fees are only earned if the candidates are ultimately hired by our clients. The typical fee structure is based upon a percentage of the candidate’s annual compensation in their first year of employment, which is known or can be estimated at the time of placement. 
The key drivers of Direct Hire revenue are the number of placements and the associated placement fee. Direct Hire revenue also includes conversion revenue, which may occur when a consultant initially assigned to a client on a temporary basis is later converted to a permanent placement for a fee. Direct Hire revenue is recognized net of an allowance for “fallouts,” which occur when candidates do not complete the applicable contingency period (typically 90 days or less). There are no consultant payroll costs associated with Direct Hire placements, thus, all Direct Hire revenue increases gross profit by the full amount of the fee. Direct Hire associate commissions, compensation and benefits are included in SG&A.
Industry Overview
The professional staffing industry is made up of thousands of companies, most of which are small local firms providing limited service offerings to a relatively small local client base. A report published by SIA in 2018 indicated that Kforce is one of the 10 largest publicly-traded specialty staffing firms in the U.S.
Based upon previous economic cycles experienced by Kforce, we believe that times of sustained economic recovery generally stimulate demand for additional temporary workers in the U.S. and, conversely, an economic slowdown results in a contraction in demand for additional temporary workers in the U.S. From an economic standpoint, temporary employment figures and trends are important indicators of staffing demand, which continued to be positive during 2018, based on data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and SIA. The percentage of temporary staffing to total employment (penetration rate) and unemployment rate was 2.1% and 3.9%, respectively, in December 2018. Total non-farm employment was up 1.8% year-over-year as of December 2018, and temporary help employment was up 3.3% year-over-year. In addition, the college-level unemployment rate, which we believe serves as a proxy for professional employment and therefore aligns well with the consultant and candidate population that Kforce most typically serves, was 2.1% in December 2018. Further, we believe that the unemployment rate in the specialties we serve, especially in certain technology skill sets, is lower than the published averages, which we believe speaks to the demand environment in which we are operating.
According to a SIA in September 2018, the technology temporary staffing industry and finance and accounting temporary staffing industry are expected to generate projected revenues of $32.0 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively, in 2019 and based on these projected revenues, our current market share is approximately 3% and 4%, respectively. Our business strategies are sharply focused around expanding our share of the U.S. temporary staffing industry and further penetrating our existing clients’ human capital needs.
Business Strategies
Our primary objectives are driving long-term shareholder value by achieving above-market revenue growth, making prudent investments to enhance efficiency and effectiveness within our operating model and significantly improving levels of operating profitability. We believe the following strategies will help us achieve our objectives. 
Improving Productivity of our Talent. We believe that it is critical to provide our associates with high quality tools to effectively and efficiently perform their roles, to better evaluate business opportunities and to advance the value we bring to our clients and consultants. We continue to enhance our sales methodologies and processes in ways we believe will allow us to better evaluate and shape business opportunities with our clients as well as train our sales associates on our consistent and uniform methodology. 
During 2018, we completed the deployment of a new time and expense application for our consultants and clients as well as a new expense application for our associates. In addition, we continue to make enhancements to our business and data intelligence capabilities as well as our customer relationship management system. We also began investing in a new talent relationship management system that we expect will better leverage our delivery strategies and processes and improve our capabilities. These investments are part of a multi-year effort to replace and upgrade our technology tools to equip our associates with improved capabilities to deliver exceptional service to our clients, consultants and candidates and improve the productivity of our associates and the scalability of our organization.
Enhancing our Client Relationships. We strive to differentiate ourselves by working collaboratively with our clients to better understand their business challenges and help them attain their organizational objectives. This collaboration focuses on building a consultative partnership rather than a transactional client relationship, which increases the intimacy with our clients and improves our ability to offer higher value and a broader array of services and support to our clients. To accomplish this, we align our revenue-generating talent with the appropriate clients based on their experience with markets, products and industries. 
We measure our success in building long-lasting relationships with our clients using staffing industry benchmarks and surveys conducted by a specialized, independent third-party provider. Our client ratings compare very favorably against staffing industry averages and give us helpful insights directly from our clients on how to continue improving our relationships. We believe long-lasting relationships with our clients is a critical element in revenue growth.
Improving the Job Seeker Experience. Our consultants are a critical component to our business and essential in sustaining our client relationships. We are focused on effective and efficient processes and tools to find and attract prospective consultants, matching them to a client assignment and supporting them during their tenure with Kforce. Our success in this regard would be expected to positively influence the tenure and loyalty of our consultants and be their employer of choice, thus enabling us to deliver the highest quality talent to our clients. 
We measure the quality of our service to and support of our consultants using staffing industry benchmarks and surveys conducted by a specialized, independent third-party provider. Our consultant ratings, similar to our client ratings, compare very favorably against staffing industry averages and give us helpful insights directly from our consultants on where and how we can continue improving our service during the various phases of our relationship.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented staffing industry comprised of large national and local staffing firms in each of our reporting segments. The local firms are typically operator-owned, and each market generally has one or more significant competitors. We also face competition from national and regional accounting, consulting and advisory firms that offer both solutions and staffing services. However, we believe that our U.S. geographic presence, concentration of service offerings in areas of greatest demand (especially technology), national delivery teams, delivery channels for foreign consultants, longevity of our brand and reputation in the market, along with our dedicated compliance and regulatory infrastructure, all provide a competitive advantage. 
Many clients utilize Managed Service Providers (“MSP”) or Vendor Management Organizations (“VMO”) for the management and procurement of staffing services. Generally, MSPs and VMOs are organizations that standardize processes through the use of Vendor Management Systems (“VMS”), which are tools used to aggregate spend and measure supplier performance. VMSs can also be provided through independent providers. Typically, MSPs, VMOs and/or VMS providers charge staffing firms administrative fees ranging from 1% to 4% of total revenue. In addition, the aggregation of services by MSPs for their clients into a single program can result in significant buying power and, thus, pricing power. Therefore, the use of MSPs by our clients has, in certain instances, resulted in margin compression. Kforce does not currently provide MSP or VMO services directly to our clients; rather, our strategy has been to work with MSPs, VMOs and VMS providers that enable us to best extend our services to current and prospective clients.
We believe that the principal elements of competition in our industry are quality and availability of associates, candidates and consultants, level of service, effective monitoring of job performance, scope of geographic service and compliance orientation. To attract consultants and candidates, we emphasize on our ability to provide competitive compensation and benefits, quality and varied assignments, scheduling flexibility and permanent placement opportunities, all of which are important to Kforce being the employer of choice. Because individuals pursue other employment opportunities on a regular basis, it is important that we respond to market conditions affecting these individuals and focus on our consultant relationship objectives. Additionally, in certain markets, we have experienced significant pricing pressure as a result of our competitors’ pricing strategies. Although we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors, we expect competition and pricing pressure to continue, which may result in us not being able to effectively compete or choosing to not participate in certain business that does not meet our profitability standard.
Regulatory Environment
Staffing firms are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulations: (1) regulation of the employer/employee relationship, such as wage and hour regulations, tax withholding and reporting, immigration regulations, social security and other retirement, anti-discrimination, employee benefits and workers’ compensation regulations; (2) registration, licensing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements; (3) worker classification regulations; and (4) substantive limitations on their operations. 
In providing staffing and solution services to the Federal Government, we must comply with complex laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of Federal Government contracts. These laws and regulations create compliance risk and affect how we do business with our federal agency clients, and may impose additional costs on our business.
Because we operate in a complex regulatory environment, one of our top priorities is compliance. For more discussion of the potential impact that the regulatory environment could have on Kforce’s financial results, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Operating Employees and Personnel
As of December 31, 2018, Kforce employed approximately 2,400 associates and 11,400 consultants on assignment providing flexible staffing services and solutions to our clients. Approximately 92% of the consultants are employed directly by Kforce; the other 8% consists of qualified independent contractors. As the employer, Kforce is responsible for the employer’s share of applicable social security taxes (“FICA”), federal and state unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation insurance and other direct labor costs relating to our employees. We offer access to various health, life and disability insurance programs and other benefits for our employees. We have no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees, have never experienced any material labor disruption, and are unaware of any current efforts or plans to organize any of our employees.
Insurance
Kforce maintains a number of insurance policies including general liability, automobile liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, liability for certain foreign exposure, umbrella and excess liability, property, crime, fiduciary, directors and officers, employment practices liability, cybersecurity, professional liability and excess health insurance coverage. These policies provide coverage subject to their terms, conditions, limits of liability and deductibles, for certain liabilities that may arise from Kforce’s operations. There can be no assurance that any of the above policies will be adequate for our needs or that we will maintain all such policies in the future.
