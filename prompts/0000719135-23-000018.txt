ITEM 1. Business
General
Apyx Medical Corporation (“Company”, “Apyx Medical”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) was incorporated in 1982, under the laws of the State of Delaware and has its principal executive office at 5115 Ulmerton Road, Clearwater, FL 33760.
We are an advanced energy technology company with a passion for elevating people’s lives through innovative products, including our Helium Plasma Technology products marketed and sold as Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market and J-Plasma® in the hospital surgical market. Our primary focus is on the cosmetic surgery market where Renuvion® offers plastic surgeons, fascial plastic surgeons and cosmetic physicians a unique ability to provide controlled heat to the tissue to achieve their desired results. We also leverage our deep expertise and decades of experience in unique waveforms through original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) agreements with other medical device manufacturers. 
As part of our plan to accelerate and fully fund the development of our advanced energy business, with a focus in the cosmetic surgery market, we sold our Core business in 2018 for gross proceeds of $97 million. These proceeds were used to launch broad marketing and sales initiatives which resulted in rapid sales growth through December 31, 2021 and into the first quarter of 2022. This planned growth in the business was accompanied by scaled operations, including procurement of components, expanded manufacturing capacity to turn those materials into saleable inventory, additional discretionary expenditures, including increased global participation at trade shows, additional employee trainings, user meetings, increased travel and entertainment expenses, more expansive research and development projects, and additional headcount to support those activities. Additionally, we had and still have, some significant non-recurring discretionary expenditures associated with completing our multi-year marketing initiatives related to our dermal resurfacing and skin laxity clearances. 
On March 14, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) posted a Safety Communication that warns consumers and health care providers against the use of our Advanced Energy products outside of their FDA-cleared indications for general use in cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft tissue during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. Following the Safety Communication, we experienced slowed demand for the adoption of our Helium Plasma Technology. 
On May 26, 2022, we announced that we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the use of the Renuvion Dermal Handpiece for specific dermal resurfacing procedures. On July 18, 2022, we announced that we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the use of the Renuvion® APR Handpiece for certain skin contraction procedures. 
On June 2, 2022, and July 21, 2022, the FDA updated the Medical Device Safety Communication to recognize the new 510(k) clearances for the Renuvion® Dermal handpiece, and the expanded indications for the Renuvion® APR handpieces. The 510(k) clearance for the Renuvion® Dermal handpiece allows surgeons to perform dermal resurfacing procedures for the treatment of moderate to severe wrinkles and rhytides, limited to patients with Fitzpatrick Skin Types I, II or III. The 510(k) clearance for the Renuvion® APR handpieces now addresses improving the appearance of lax (loose) skin in the neck and submental region. 
On February 1, 2023, we announced we had submitted a 510(k) premarket notification (“510(k) submission”) for the Renuvion APR Handpiece to the FDA, supported by a clinical study and real-world evidence. The 510(k) submission is intended to expand Renuvion’s indications for use to include a specific indication for the use of the Renuvion APR Handpiece for the coagulation of subcutaneous soft tissues where needed, following liposuction. 
On February 27, 2023, we announced that we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the use of the Renuvion APR Handpiece for the delivery of radiofrequency energy and/or helium plasma where coagulation/contraction of soft tissue is needed. Soft tissue includes subcutaneous tissue.
While we expected that receiving the two clearances in 2022 would materially mitigate the financial effects of the Safety Communication in future periods, we continue to experience reduced demand for the adoption and utilization of our technology and we believe that this may have an adverse effect in future periods. In 2023, we expect to deliver growth in global sales of our Advanced Energy products, fueled by strong execution on our commercial and regulatory objectives and improving generator demand trends as we move through fiscal 2023. We remain focused on maximizing our resources through prudent expense management and have recently implemented activities to eliminate certain operating expenses to improve cash flow, while preserving our capabilities as an organization. We also continue to actively evaluate all potential options to enhance our liquidity and financial condition. 
APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION

While sales were continuing to grow into the first quarter of 2022 prior to the FDA Safety Communication, over the last few years, exclusive of our sale of the Core business segment to Symmetry Surgical during 2018, we have incurred recurring net losses and cash outflows from operations and we anticipate that losses will continue in the near term. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred an operating loss of $23.6 million and used $20.3 million of cash in operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.2 million. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements, including in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
In an effort to alleviate these conditions, we pursued various funding solutions in order to improve liquidity. 
On November 22, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement providing us the ability to register securities in the aggregate amount up to $100 million. The shelf registration included an embedded ATM facility for up to $40 million. To date we have not utilized this facility.
On February 17, 2023, we entered into a Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with MidCap Funding IV Trust (as agent), and MidCap Financial Trust (as term loan servicer), and the lenders party thereto from time to time.
The Credit Agreement provides for an up to $35 million facility, consisting of senior secured term loans and a secured revolving facility. The Credit Agreement provides for senior secured term loans of up to $25 million, comprised of (i) an initial tranche of $10 million, (ii) a second tranche of $5 million, and (iii) a third tranche of $10 million. The secured revolving facility provides for loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $10 million, subject to a borrowing base equal to certain percentages of the Company’s eligible accounts receivable and inventory, as determined in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. 
For a more in depth description of the terms of the Credit Agreement see Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K.
On February 27, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell and leaseback the our real property located in Clearwater, FL. On March 14, 2023, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with VK Acquisitions VI, LLC (the “Purchaser”), for the sale of our facility located at 5115 Ulmerton Road, Clearwater, Florida, as more fully described in the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the “Property”) for a purchase price of $7,650,000. The Purchase Agreement is subject to the satisfactory completion of due diligence by the Purchaser. Upon the closing of the sale of the Property, we will enter into a lease agreement with the Purchaser, pursuant to which the Property will be leased back to us. 
For a more in depth description of the terms of the Purchase Agreement see Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K.
During January 2023, we were notified that the IRS examination process of our 2018, 2019 and 2020 tax returns was complete and that the our tax refunds were approved for substantially the amount recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022. As of the date of this report, we are awaiting receipt of the tax refunds.
We also continue to re-assess our operating expenditures and cost structure to be commensurate with our expected levels of revenue and we have the ability to reduce or delay expenditures to enhance and preserve liquidity. We have already reduced some operating expenditures, including a reduction-in-force on January 9, 2023, that reduced our U.S. headcount by 14%. 
We believe that the actions already taken, and additional actions that we intend to take to manage operating expenditures, will enable us to meet our obligations for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of our audited consolidated financial statements. As a result, we believe our plans alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our audited financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the carrying amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
We continue to focus our efforts to increase the adoption of our Advanced Energy technology and utilization of our handpieces by surgeons in the U.S. and fulfilling demand from distributors in our international markets. Management estimates that our products have been sold in more than 60 countries. As of December 31, 2022, we had a direct sales force of 35 field-based selling professionals and utilized 3 independent sales agencies. We also had 4 sales managers. This selling organization is focused on the use of Renuvion® and J-Plasma® in the cosmetic and hospital surgical markets, supported by our global medical affairs team. This global team of clinical support specialists focuses on supporting our users to ensure optimal 
APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION

outcomes for their patients. In addition, we have invested in training programs and marketing-related activities to support accelerated adoption of Renuvion® into surgeons' practices.
In response to the global supply chain instability and inflationary cost increases, we continue to take action to minimize, as much as possible, any potential adverse impacts by working closely with our suppliers to closely monitor the availability of raw material components (i.e. semiconductors and plastics), lead times, and freight carrier availability. We expect global supply chain instability will continue to have an impact on our business, but to date that has not been material to our financial performance. The consequences of global supply chain instability, inflationary cost increases and the pandemic, and their adverse impact to the global economy, continue to evolve. Accordingly, the significance of the future impact to our business and financial statements remains subject to significant uncertainty.
We strongly encourage investors to visit our website: www.apyxmedical.com to view the most current news and to review our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Significant Subsidiaries
Apyx Bulgaria, EOOD is a wholly owned limited liability company incorporated under Bulgarian law, located in Sofia, Bulgaria. It is engaged in the business of development and manufacturing of our advanced energy generators, as well as the manufacturing of our disposable handpieces and accessories, and development and manufacturing of OEM generators and related accessories. The facility also distributes products directly to customers in certain international markets and provides warranty and repair services.
Industry
The cosmetic surgery market is a special segment of the medical field which is involved in the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body so as to enhance the body’s appearance. The market for cosmetic surgery includes surgical, minimally invasive, and nonsurgical cosmetic procedures. This market is expected to have steady growth year-over-year and this growth is driven by social and cultural factors such as the influence of social media, peer pressure for appearance and beauty, and increasing disposable income. According to the recent International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (“ISAPS”) 2021 Global Survey report, liposicution procedures grew 24.8% year-over-year, and is now the number one aesthetic surgical procedure globally. 
We believe that we have sustainable, competitive advantages in the cosmetic surgery market for several reasons: our long history of developing unique energy devices to meet the needs of physicians, our unique Helium Plasma Technology, our outstanding product quality supported by strong engineering and research and development capabilities, and the clinical support that our expanding global medical affairs team provides to our customers. We feel that our products and our strategy as a customer-centric aesthetic medical device manufacturer have, and will continue to improve, the lives of doctors and their patients.
Intellectual Property
We rely on our intellectual property that we have developed or acquired over the years including patents, trade secrets, technical innovations and various licensing agreements to provide our future growth and build our competitive position. We have been issued 40 patents in the United States and 28 foreign patents. We have 22 pending patent applications in the United States and 58 pending foreign applications. We have 9 U.S. registered trademarks, 5 international registered trademarks, and 4 pending international trademark applications. As we continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio, we believe it is critical for us to continue to invest in filing patent applications to protect our technology, inventions and improvements. However, we can 
APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION

give no assurance that competitors will not infringe on our patent rights or otherwise create similar or non-infringing competing products that are technically patentable in their own right.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We are committed to producing the most technically advanced and highest quality products of their kind available on the market. We manufacture the majority of our products on our premises in Clearwater, Florida and at our facility located in Sofia, Bulgaria, both of which are certified under the ISO13485:2016 international quality standards and are subject to continuing regulation and routine inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with regulations relating to our quality management system, medical device complaint reporting, and adherence to FDA and other country restrictions on promotion and advertising. In addition, we are subject to regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act and other federal, state and local regulations, as well as international laws and regulations.
We work closely with our suppliers to ensure that our raw material inventory (i.e., semiconductors and plastics) needs are met, while maintaining high quality and reliability. To date, we have experienced some delays in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production requirements, but such delays have not caused a meaningful backlog of sales orders. However, it is possible that a prolonged disruption to the global supply chain could cause a backlog of sales orders in the future.  We continue to work to find other sources of supply, where feasible, and have expedited the shipments of certain raw material items to adequately maintain our production and safety stock levels, resulting in higher shipping costs. We have also experienced some impact on the purchase prices of our raw materials due to inflation, global inventory shortages. and increased demand across the manufacturing sector.
We maintain collaborative arrangements with three foreign suppliers, including our contract component manufacturer located in Ningbo, China, under which we request the development of certain products which we purchase pursuant to purchase orders.  Our purchase order commitments are never more than one year in duration and are supported by our sales forecasts. To our knowledge, none of the products that we source are through entities manufacturing in the Xinjiang province. 
During late 2019, we entered into a joint venture with our Chinese supplier to establish a foundation for the manufacturing and sale of our Advanced Energy products into the Chinese market. As of the date of this report, the joint venture has not commenced its principal operations. 
Backlog
The value of unshipped factory orders is not material.
Sustainability
We have created a strong environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) structure by introducing a cross-functional ESG team which has been working with senior management, our board, and other stakeholders to develop an ESG framework that is aligned with our corporate mission, vision and values. Our ESG initiatives are sponsored by our CEO and CFO, and includes a steering committee comprised of all members of the executive management team as well as some mid-level managers in certain areas such as R&D, Regulatory and Quality. In July 2022, we published our first ESG report aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) Medical Equipment industry standards.
Part of our culture is to give back and support the communities and people around us. In 2022, we engaged in both employee volunteer and financial support in the areas of education and the environment. Such initiatives included the following:
•Week-long high school internship\shadowing program for students interested in the field of engineering;
•Hosting a group of 25 local students participating in their school’s STEM program at our manufacturing facility 
•Employee participation in a local beach clean up event
•Donation of supplies to a local elementary school and to support those impacted by Hurricane Ian
•Local food drive donations as well as gifts for less fortunate children during the holidays
•Several financial contributions and sponsorships to various non-profit organizations
Human Capital Management
APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION

At December 31, 2022, we had 276 full-time employees world-wide, of whom 4 were executive officers, 47 were supervisory personnel, 36 were sales personnel and 189 were technical support, administrative and production employees. None of our current employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage. During 2022, our voluntary employee turnover rate was approximately 13.6%.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We have worked to create a culture that fosters employee engagement, where diverse talent is productive and passionate about the work they do. We continuously focus our efforts on cultivating and enhancing our working culture that embraces equality, diversity and inclusion. Currently, over half of our global workforce is represented by women, including half of our executive management team. In addition, in the U.S., approximately 36% of our employees are from minority ethnic\racial groups. 
Recruitment, Training and Development
The implementation of our growth strategy largely depends on our ability to hire, train, and retain our workforce. Our recruitment practices include cross-functional departmental interviewing, allowing for the best fit not just for a specific department, but the Company as a whole. We also ensure all of our employees are fully trained and competent for the role for which they were hired. In addition, we train our sales professionals to thoroughly understand our Helium Plasma Technology and the marketplace in which we compete, including how our technologies can increase our customer's revenue and the results they are able to achieve for their patients. 
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance, and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate them to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance, specifically:
•We offer wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location; 
•Our compensation practices are fair and equitable across all levels of the organization, from our Executive Officers to our hourly employees;
•We work with both local and nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive and non-executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within our industry; 
•We may provide our non-hourly U.S-based employees long term incentives in the form of stock options to help foster a culture of ownership, and empower individuals to drive continuous improvements to increase stockholder value; 
•Annual increases and incentive compensation are based on merit, which is communicated to employees at the time of hiring and documented through our talent management process as part of our annual review procedures and upon internal transfer and/or promotion; 
•All employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan, and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs.

APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION

Our Two Business Segments 
Our reportable segments are disclosed as principally organized and managed as two operating segments: Advanced Energy and OEM. “Corporate & Other” includes certain unallocated corporate and administrative costs which are not specifically attributed to any reportable segment. The OEM segment is primarily development and manufacturing contract and product driven, and all related expenses are recorded as cost of sales, therefore no segment specific operating expenses are incurred.
In regards to these operating segments, our results are aggregated into reportable segments only if they exhibit similar economic characteristics. In addition to similar economic characteristics, we also consider the following factors in determining the reportable segments: the nature of business activities, the management structure directly accountable to our chief operating decision maker for operating and administrative activities, availability of discrete financial information, and information presented to the Board of Directors and investors. Asset information is not reviewed by the chief operating decision maker by segment and is not available by segment and, accordingly, we have not presented a measure of assets by reportable segment.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, our OEM segment contributed 17.3% of our consolidated total revenue and our Advanced Energy segment contributed 82.7% of our consolidated total revenue.
Advanced Energy Segment
Overview
Our product portfolio consists of our Helium Plasma Technology that is marketed and sold as Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market and J-Plasma® in the hospital surgical market. Our primary focus is on the cosmetic surgery market where Renuvion® offers plastic surgeons, fascial plastic surgeons and cosmetic physicians a unique ability to provide controlled heat to the tissue to achieve their desired results. This technology has FDA clearance, CE mark, and clearance for sale in multiple other countries and is generally indicated for the cutting, coagulation and ablation of soft tissue. The system consists of an electrosurgical generator unit (“ESU”), a handpiece and a supply of helium gas. The proprietary radiofrequency (“RF”) energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas passes over the energized electrode, helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam. The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is unique in that it allows for the application of heat to tissue in a way that is not possible with traditional monopolar or bipolar technologies. This technology has been the subject of over ninety peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, abstracts, and posters. It also continues to be the subject of numerous presentations at traditional and cosmetic surgery conferences around the world.
This technology initially received FDA clearance in 2012 and a CE mark in December 2014, which enables us to sell the product in the European Union. In 2014, we created and trained a direct sales force dedicated to sell this technology. In 2015, we continued the commercialization process for our Helium Plasma Technology with a multi-faceted strategy designed to accelerate adoption of the product. This strategy primarily involved deployment of a dedicated sales force, developing product line extensions and expanding the specialties in which this technology can become the “standard of care” for certain procedures.
During 2022, we continued our full-scale, global, commercialization efforts for Renuvion® in the cosmetic and plastic surgery markets. As of December 31, 2022, we had a direct sales force of 35 field-based selling professionals and utilized 3 independent sales agencies. We also had 4 sales managers. This selling organization is focused on the use of Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market, supported by our global medical affairs team. This global team of clinical support specialists focuses on supporting our users to ensure optimal outcomes for their patients. In addition, we have invested in training programs and marketing-related activities to support accelerated adoption of Renuvion® into physicians’ practices.
From 2015 through 2022, we launched numerous new extensions to our Helium Plasma product lines in an effort to target new surgical procedures, users, and markets. Most notably, throughout 2021, we continued our launch of our Renuvion® Apyx Plasma RF handpieces (“APR”) around the world. These handpieces were designed with improved ergonomics and usability for our Renuvion® customers. As a result of our sales, marketing and product development initiatives, we have significantly increased the number of physicians using our Helium Plasma Technology by expanding usage to include the cosmetic surgery market in the U.S., and the cosmetic surgery market as well as the surgical oncology market outside the U.S. In late January 2023, we launched our recently FDA approved Apyx One Console in the US. This is a multi-functional generator incorporating an advanced 3-in-1 energy system that enables plastic and cosmetic surgeons to utilize Renuvion technology, together with full monopolar and bipolar energy. 
APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION

Key features of the Apyx One Console include adaptive and intuitive touch screens, procedural presets by body part, cloud connectivity, data sharing and logging, remote upgrade capabilities and system diagnostics, and an advanced gas system that measures and monitors gas volume and usage. 
In order to assist us in leveraging our Helium Plasma Technology’s precision and effectiveness in multiple surgical specialties, we continue to utilize our Medical Advisory Board which currently consists of 5 members representing the plastic surgery, fascial plastic surgery, and cosmetic procedure specialties.
Our commercial strategy in the U.S. and outside the U.S. is primarily focused on advancing the usage of Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market. In some of our international markets, we continue to provide support to our customers who have adopted our J-Plasma® technology for the hospital surgical market. We continue to develop a clinical and regulatory strategy, and corresponding marketing campaigns, to support our market focus. We also continue to expand the reach of our global medical affairs team in order to provide clinical support to our customers in all markets.
We continue to make substantial investments in the development and marketing of our Renuvion® technology for the long-term benefit of the Company and its stakeholders, and this may adversely affect our short-term operating performance and cash flows, particularly over the next 12 to 18 months. While we believe that these investments have the potential to generate additional revenues and profits in the future, there can be no assurance that our Helium Plasma Technology will continue to be successful or that such future revenues and profitability will be realized.
Customers
In the U.S., we primarily sell our Renuvion® products through our direct sales force to physicians, cosmetic surgery offices and surgical centers. Outside of the U.S., all of our products are sold primarily through our distributor network.
Products
Our Advanced Energy Products consist of our Helium Plasma Technology lines (Renuvion® and J-Plasma®). These product lines consist of a multifunction generator, a handpiece and a supply of helium gas. RF energy is delivered to the handpiece by the generator and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas passes over the energized electrode, helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam. The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is unique in that it allows for the application of heat to tissue in a way that is not possible with traditional monopolar or bipolar technologies. 
Helium Plasma Generator
While we did a limited launch of our Apyx Once Console in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2022, full commercial launch of the generator in the U.S. started in January 2023. Internationally, during 2022, we continued our launch of the Renuvion® System 3 generator, to markets outside the U.S. This high frequency electrosurgical generator can be used for delivery of RF energy and/or helium plasma to cut, coagulate and ablate soft tissue during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. This new generator was built for use with our Renuvion® APR handpieces, and features enhanced capabilities such as a joule counter, capable of displaying energy delivered to the patient, and new Auto-Bipolar functionality, which expands the surgical capabilities of the system. These new product releases continue to expand the procedure base for our Helium Plasma Technology by providing surgeons with the tools they need to access additional anatomic locations and perform specific procedures.
Disposables Portfolio
We offer a variety of different hand pieces for open and laparoscopic procedures. The helium-based plasma generated from these devices has been shown to provide increased precision and control and cause less thermal damage to tissue than CO2 laser, argon plasma and RF energy products currently available on the market. The technology has a general indication and can be used for cutting, coagulating and ablating soft tissue. The advantages of helium plasma continue to be studied throughout the medical and scientific communities. We believe that cosmetic surgery applications are the primary area of opportunity for this technology. In 2020, we completed the launch of our new generation APR handpieces in the U.S. market. During 2021, we began to launch these new handpieces in our international markets, designed specifically for minimally invasive use, with improved ergonomics and safety features. 
APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION

Competition
Currently, we are the only company with helium-based plasma products and two specific indications from the FDA. While the FDA Safety Notice did impact our sales, and there are RF-based competitors, argon plasma competitors, and CO2 laser competitors for our target market, we still believe our competitive position did not change in 2022. 
FDA and Other Government Regulations
The Company’s business is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement.  We are subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations, and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the our financial condition and business operations.  In the U.S., the drug, device, and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting.  The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction.  Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S.  The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation.
For example, the European Union enacted the European Union Medical Device Regulation in May 2017 with an effective date of May 2021, which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the areas of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems, labeling and post-market surveillance.  Additionally, as a result of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Brexit), new medical device regulations were released by the United Kingdom, which became effective January 1, 2021.  A gap analysis against the prior Medical Device Directive (“MDD”), a compliance plan was implemented, and the plan is being executed for both the European Union and United Kingdom regulations to ensure compliance and minimize business disruption.
The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions.  In some cases, the Company’s may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.
The FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities.  If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law.  The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business.
On March 14, 2022, the FDA posted a Safety Communication that warns consumers and health care providers against the use of our Advanced Energy products outside of their FDA-cleared indications for general use in cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft tissue during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. Following the Safety Communication, we experienced slowed demand for the adoption of our Helium Plasma Technology. Throughout 2022, and continuing into 2023, we have been working closely with the FDA to gain clearances for the use of our products in various surgical applications, demonstrating our commitment to both safety and efficacy, supported by both clinical study and real-world data. 
The costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and congress on device prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to recommend, use or purchase particular medical

devices. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and healthcare providers. 
Various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to certain non-physician practitioners. Payers have become a more potent force in the marketplace and increased attention is being paid to medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of healthcare generally. However, most of the Company’s products are not reimbursable by payers (including the US. Government) which alleviates some of the burden of reporting. Nevertheless, we are committed to following all legal requirements, as well as company policies and procedures as it relates to our interactions with healthcare professionals. At all times, we will provide information to healthcare professionals that is truthful, not misleading, and consistent with our product labeling and supported by our data.
Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”) 
The International Medical Device Regulators Forum (“IMDRF”) recognized that a global approach to auditing and monitoring the manufacturing of medical devices could improve their safety and oversight on an international scale. The IMDRF established a work group that developed specific documents to advance a MDSAP. The Medical Device Single Audit Program allowed MDSAP recognized Auditing Organizations to conduct a single regulatory audit of a medical device manufacturer to satisfy the relevant requirements of the regulatory authorities participating in the program. Today the regulatory authority members include the US, Australia, Brazil, Canada and Japan, official observers European Union and United Kingdom, and affiliates Argentina, Israel, South Korea, and Singapore. In February 2022, we underwent a successful annual MDSAP audit by our registrar GMED SAS. There were no observations related to safety or efficacy of our products noted during this MDSAP audit. The FDA accepts MDSAP audit reports as a substitute for routine Agency inspections.
Global Supply Chain Impact
Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.
OEM Segment 
Overview
We leverage our expertise in the design, development and manufacturing of electrosurgical equipment and medical devices by producing generators, medical devices and related accessories for large, well-known medical device manufacturers through original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) agreements, as well as start-up companies with the need for our energy-based designs. In connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement with Symmetry Surgical in 2018, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement for a ten-year term, whereby we will manufacture certain products and sell to them at agreed upon prices. Revenue, costs and expenses resulting from this agreement are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of income or loss from operations of our OEM reporting segment.
