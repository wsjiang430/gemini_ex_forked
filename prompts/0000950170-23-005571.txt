General
 
Yum China is the largest restaurant company in China in terms of 2022 system sales. We had $9.6 billion of revenues in 2022 and nearly 13,000 restaurants as of December 31, 2022. Our growing restaurant network consists of our flagship KFC and Pizza Hut brands, as well as emerging brands such as Taco Bell, Lavazza, Little Sheep and Huang Ji Huang.

We have the exclusive right to operate and sublicense the KFC, Pizza Hut and, subject to achieving certain agreed-upon milestones, Taco Bell brands in China, excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. We own the intellectual property of the Little Sheep and Huang Ji Huang concepts outright. KFC was the first major global restaurant brand to enter China in 1987. With more than 35 years of operations, we have developed extensive operating experience in the China market. We have since grown to become the largest restaurant company in China in terms of 2022 system sales, with nearly 13,000 restaurants covering over 1,800 cities primarily in China as of December 31, 2022. We believe that there are significant opportunities to expand within China, and we intend to focus our efforts on increasing our geographic footprint in both existing and new cities.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we owned and operated approximately 86% of our restaurants. Franchisees contribute to our revenue through the payment of upfront franchise fees and on-going royalties based on a percentage of sales, and payments for other transactions with us, such as purchases of food and paper products, advertising services, delivery services and other services.
 
Restaurant Concepts
 
KFC
 
KFC is the leading and the largest quick-service restaurant (“QSR”) brand in China in terms of 2022 system sales. Founded in Corbin, Kentucky by Colonel Harland D. Sanders in 1939, KFC opened its first restaurant in Beijing, China in 1987. As of December 31, 2022, there were over 9,000 KFC restaurants in more than 1,800 cities across China. In addition to Original Recipe® chicken and other chicken products, KFC in China has an extensive menu featuring beef burgers, pork, seafood, rice dishes, congees, fresh vegetables, desserts, coffee, tea and many other products. KFC also seeks to increase revenue from different channels, including dine-in, delivery, takeaway and packaged foods such as steak, fried rice and pasta. KFC primarily competes with western QSR brands in China, such as McDonald’s, Dicos and Burger King, among which we believe KFC had an approximate two-to-one  lead over its nearest competitor in terms of store count as of the end of 2022.
Pizza Hut
 
Pizza Hut is the leading and the largest casual dining restaurant (“CDR”) brand in China in terms of 2022 system sales and number of restaurants as of December 31, 2022, offering multiple dayparts, including breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. Since opening its first China restaurant unit in Beijing in 1990, Pizza Hut has grown rapidly and, as of year-end 2022, there were over 2,900 Pizza Hut restaurants in over 650 cities across China. Pizza Hut has an extensive menu offering a broad variety of pizzas, steaks, pasta, rice dishes and other entrees, appetizers, beverages and desserts. Pizza Hut also aims to further drive growth from different channels and occasions, including dine-in, delivery, takeaway and packaged foods such as steak and pasta. Measured by number of restaurants, we believe Pizza Hut has an approximate five-to-one lead over its nearest western CDR competitor in China as of the end of 2022.
2022 Form 10-K


Other Concepts
 
In addition to KFC and Pizza Hut, our restaurant brand portfolio also includes Taco Bell, Lavazza, Little Sheep and Huang Ji Huang.
 
Taco Bell. Taco Bell is the world’s leading western QSR brand specializing in Mexican-style food, including tacos, burritos, quesadillas, salads, nachos and similar items. We opened our first Taco Bell restaurant in Shanghai, China, in December 2016. As of December 31, 2022, there were over 90 Taco Bell units in China.

Lavazza. In April 2020, we partnered with Luigi Lavazza S.p.A. (“Lavazza Group”), the world-renowned family-owned Italian coffee company, and established a joint venture (“Lavazza joint venture”), to explore and develop the Lavazza coffee concept in China. In September 2021, the Company and Lavazza Group entered into agreements to accelerate the expansion of Lavazza coffee shops, which offer a premium and authentic Italian coffee experience in China. As of December 31, 2022, there were 85 Lavazza units in China.

Little Sheep. Little Sheep, with its roots in Inner Mongolia, China, specializes in “Hot Pot” cooking, which is very popular in China, particularly during the winter months. Little Sheep had over 180 units in both China and international markets as of December 31, 2022. Of these, 175 units were franchise restaurants.
 
Huang Ji Huang. In April 2020, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Huang Ji Huang. Founded in 2004, Huang Ji Huang had over 590 units in China and internationally as of December 31, 2022. Huang Ji Huang primarily operates a franchise model and is an industry-leading simmer pot brand.
 
Our Strategies
 
Our primary strategy is to grow sales and profits across our portfolio of brands through organic growth, growth of franchise restaurants and development of new restaurant concepts, along with growing our online business. We are accelerating our store network expansion to reach our next milestone of 20,000 stores. We will drive growth from our core brands, as well as emerging brands such as Taco Bell and Lavazza. We will continue to invest in digitalization and supply chain, our key growth enablers.
 
Continue to strategically expand our restaurant network

We are confident in the long-term market opportunities in China. We believe we have the potential to grow to 20,000 restaurants or more in the future and we are currently tracking over 900 cities that do not have a KFC or Pizza Hut restaurant.
 
Further expand geographical coverage. Restaurant chains have a low penetration rate in China, especially in lower-tier cities. Given the rapidly expanding middle class and dining out population as a result of continued economic growth and urbanization, we believe there are significant opportunities to expand within China, and we intend to focus our efforts on increasing our geographic footprint in both existing and new cities. For additional information on the risks associated with this growth strategy, see the section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We may not attain our target development goals; aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales; and new restaurants may not be profitable.”
 
Explore new restaurant formats. We are keen to explore various new restaurant formats to support further store expansion, including different store designs or service models aimed at addressing the needs of different guests and for different occasions. We believe that our first-mover advantage and in-depth local know-how will help us to build robust development pipelines to seize the market opportunities.
 
Capture franchise opportunity. While we continue to focus on the operation of our Company-owned restaurant units, we will also continue to seek franchise opportunities for both our core and emerging brands. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 14% of our restaurants were operated by franchisees. We anticipate high franchisee demand for our brands, supported by strong unit economics, operational consistency and multiple store formats to drive restaurant growth. While the franchise market in China is still in an early stage compared to developed markets, we plan to continue to develop our franchisee-owned store portfolio over time by focusing on select channels and lower-tier city development, among others.
 
Grow emerging brands. Our key growth strategy for emerging brands, such as Taco Bell, Lavazza, Little Sheep and Huang Ji Huang, focuses on exploring suitable business models to achieve sustainable growth. In addition, we plan to continue our efforts in product innovation and operational enhancement for these emerging brands to potentially scale up operations in the future.

Continue to improve unit-level performance and develop new sources of revenue
 
Food innovation and value proposition. We will continue to focus on food innovation and strengthen our value proposition. We are keenly aware of the strength of our core menu items. At the same time, we seek to continue to introduce innovative items to meet evolving consumer preferences and local tastes, drive guest engagement and continue to broaden our brand appeal. Each of our restaurant concepts has proprietary menu items, and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients. We will continue to develop unique recipes, regionally-inspired menu items and special seasonings to provide appealing, tasty and convenient food choices at competitive prices. In addition, KFC plans to continue providing value with product offerings such as the bucket and increased combo options throughout the day and Pizza Hut plans to continue its multiple value campaigns. We will continue to promote signature value campaigns such as “Crazy Thursday” and “Buy More Save More on Sunday” for KFC and “Scream Wednesday” for Pizza Hut, which offer selected menu items at attractive prices, and have received positive consumer feedback. We believe our continued food innovation and value proposition are pivotal to enhancing our unit-level performance by driving order frequency and order ticket size.
 
Daypart opportunities. We believe there are significant daypart opportunities across our brands. For example, KFC has expanded its daypart offerings, including late night street food and afternoon tea, and Pizza Hut continued to drive sales from breakfast and business lunch.

Best in-store experience. We continuously look for ways to improve the guest experience. For example, we plan to continue to invest in refurbishing our restaurants. Our brands also look to improve efficiency to drive sales growth. For instance, we have simplified menus and fine-tuned our in-store self-service order devices. We are also expanding our delivery business through our proprietary smartphone applications and pre-order services. In addition, we are continuously investing in digital and automation to improve operating transparency and efficiency. For example, our smart order system enhances the customer experience by reducing wait times and providing real-time order status, and we also added robotic servers at one-third of our Pizza Hut restaurants, freeing up crews to serve customers. To further enhance the guest experience, we are also evaluating the possibility of adopting other digital initiatives in our restaurants and will continue to invest in this area, as discussed more fully below.
 
Continue to invest in technology, with a focus to capture digital, delivery and off-premise consumption opportunities
 
We will continue to invest in technology to further empower and maintain our competitive advantages. We will focus on improving our overall technology infrastructure and digital and delivery capabilities. We believe these efforts will further support our sustainable growth, improve our operational efficiency and ensure quality. Our digital and delivery strategies are set forth below.
 
Digital. As of December 31, 2022, our loyalty programs had over 380 million members and over 130 million members for KFC and Pizza Hut, respectively. The programs have been effective in increasing order frequency and enhancing guest loyalty. Digital orders exceeded $8 billion and accounted for approximately 89% of KFC and Pizza Hut Company sales in 2022. Going forward, we will continue to leverage our powerful digital ecosystem to drive sales, improve the guest experience and increase operational efficiency. We plan to increase our investment in end-to-end digitalization, automation and artificial intelligence (“AI”), to more effectively connect online traffic with our offline assets. To improve our operational efficiency, we will focus on connecting our front-end, guest facing systems to back-end systems such as operations and supply chain.
 
Delivery. China is a world leader in the emerging online to offline, or O2O, market. This is where digital online ordering technologies interact with traditional brick and mortar retail to enhance the customer experience. We see considerable growth potential in the delivery market by aligning our proven restaurant operation capabilities with our delivery network that offers consumers the ability to order restaurant food anywhere. Delivery contributed approximately 39% of Company sales in 2022. Going forward, we will continue to optimize our delivery service by adopting innovative technologies, rolling out new delivery menu items and developing novel delivery service concepts, such as our dynamically adjusting delivery coverage for each store by daypart, taking into account the operating hours of nearby stores.
 
New retail. As part of our strategy to drive growth from off-premise occasions, our new retail products are designed to capture at-home consumption demand by leveraging our online and offline sales channels. We launched packaged foods such as steak, fried rice and pasta, so customers can enjoy these products any time they want. In 2022, we further broadened our offerings, adding some of our restaurant classics, such as our Egg Tart and Popcorn Chicken. We also developed our own retail brand, Shaofaner, which sells packaged foods through online and offline channels. We intend to continue to capture the opportunity with our capabilities in product innovation, supply chain and online and offline assets.

Strategically optimize our restaurant portfolio
 
We aim to maintain our industry-leading position in the QSR and CDR markets in China with our core brands, and gain a stronger foothold and enhanced know-how in the Chinese cuisine space, which represents a significant share of the restaurant industry in China. In April 2020, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Huang Ji Huang, a leading Chinese CDR franchise business. Following the acquisition of Huang Ji Huang, we established a Chinese dining business unit to manage our Chinese restaurant brands.

We are also building a coffee portfolio to capture today’s underserved coffee market in China across different customer segments, including coffee products provided by KFC (“K-Coffee”), which offers convenience and value. In April 2020, we also partnered with Lavazza to explore and develop the Lavazza coffee concept in China to offer a premium and authentic Italian coffee experience in China. As of December 31, 2022, there were 85 Lavazza units in China, and we target to open 1,000 Lavazza stores in the next few years.

Prudently pursue investments in high-quality assets
 
Our investment strategy primarily focuses on three areas, restaurant brands with excellent growth potential and synergy, joint ventures and the enablers that empower our brands (e.g. ecosystem, technology). We continue to identify and evaluate investment opportunities in high-quality brands to capture growth opportunities. Also, we look for potential opportunities to invest in digitalization and supply chain, our key growth enablers, to further enhance our competitiveness. We will prudently assess investment targets based on each candidate’s strategic value, brand equity, business scale and financial performance, among other factors.

Operational Management
 
Restaurant Unit Management
 
Our restaurant management structure varies among our restaurant brands and restaurant size. Generally, each restaurant that we operate is overseen by a management team led by a restaurant general manager, or RGM, together with one or more assistant managers. RGMs are skilled and highly trained, with most having a college-level education. The performance of RGMs is regularly monitored and coached by senior operations leaders. Each restaurant brand issues detailed manuals, which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs. These manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations. The restaurant management team is responsible for the day-to-day operation of our restaurants and for ensuring compliance with operating standards. Each RGM is also responsible for handling guest complaints and emergency situations.
Franchise Restaurant Management
 
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 14% of our restaurants were franchise restaurants. Our franchise program is designed to promote consistency and quality, and we are selective in granting franchises. Franchisees supply capital initially by paying a franchise fee to us and by purchasing or leasing the land use rights, building, equipment, signs, seating, inventories and supplies; and, over the longer term, by reinvesting in the business through expansion. Franchisees contribute to our revenue through the payment of upfront franchise fees and on-going royalties based on a percentage of sales, and payments for other transactions with us, such as purchases of food and paper products, advertising services, delivery services and other services.

Our franchise agreements set out specific operational standards, which are consistent with standards required for Company-owned restaurants. Like our Company-owned restaurants, our franchise restaurants are also subject to our internal quality audits and reviews. There are no notable operational differences between Company-owned restaurants and franchise restaurants.
 
We believe that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with our franchisees and their representatives. To this end, the Company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisees and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business, including products, equipment, operational improvements and standards and management techniques.

Expansion Management
 
We believe that there are significant opportunities to expand within China and we intend to focus our efforts on increasing our geographic footprint in both existing and new cities. We expanded our restaurant count from 7,562 at the end of 2016 to 12,947 at the end of 2022, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9%. We expect to expand our business through organic growth, growth of franchise units and development of our emerging brands.
2022 Form 10-K


Our expansion strategy has been systematically focused on high potential locations across city tiers, including entering new commercial areas within existing cities and new cities. Each potential restaurant site is assessed and evaluated individually based on its site potential, potential financial return and potential impact to nearby stores. We take into account factors such as economic and demographic conditions and prospects, consumption patterns, GDP per capita and population density of the local community, presence of activity centers such as shopping complexes, schools and residential areas that generate guest traffic, and the presence of other restaurants in the vicinity during our site selection process. We also consider the guest traffic and distance from the existing restaurants under the same brand to reduce sales transfer that may occur from existing restaurant units. As we are opening more smaller format stores and actively managing costs, the average capital spending for each new KFC and Pizza Hut restaurant unit in 2022 was approximately RMB1.3 to 2 million.
Supply Chain Management

The Company’s restaurants, including those operated by franchisees, are large purchasers of a number of food and paper products, equipment and other restaurant supplies. The principal items purchased include protein ingredients (including poultry, pork, beef and seafood), cheese, oil, flour, vegetables and paper and packaging materials. The Company has not experienced any significant, continuous shortages of supplies, and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available. Prices paid for supplies fluctuate from time to time. We control our raw material costs by entering into long-term bulk purchase agreements for our key food ingredients, fully utilizing all chicken parts, increasing local sourcing and developing long-term relationships with suppliers.
 
The Company partners with over 800 independent suppliers, which are mostly China-based. We implement a strict supplier qualification process that includes supplier compliance checks and on-site audits to ensure the supplier meets our food safety and quality control standards. We have formulated detailed specifications for food ingredients and consumables we procure. We believe supply chain management is crucial to the sustainability of our business and we are dedicated to applying digitalization and automation technologies in our supply chain management system. Our in-house and integrated supply chain management system employs more than 1,400 staff in food safety, quality assurance, procurement management, logistics, engineering and supply chain system.
 
In addition, we operate a tailor-made, world-class logistics management system, which is capable of accommodating large scale, wide coverage and advanced information dissemination as well as fast store expansions. To further strengthen our supply chain network, the Company acquired land in 2022 and 2021 to build eight new logistics centers. The Company, along with multiple independently owned and operated distributors, utilizes 33 logistics centers to distribute supplies to Company-owned and franchised stores, as well as to third-party customers. In addition, the Company owns seasoning facilities for its Chinese dining business unit, which manufacture and sell seasoning products to Huang Ji Huang and Little Sheep franchisees. The Company’s supply chain strategy of working with multiple suppliers, as well as building a vast logistics network, allows for continuous supply of products in the event that supply from an individual supplier or logistics center becomes unfeasible.
 
To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our procurement process, the Company has adopted a central procurement model, whereby the Company centrally purchases the vast majority of food and paper products from approved suppliers for most of the restaurants regardless of ownership. The Company believes this central procurement model allows the Company to maintain quality control and achieves better prices and terms through volume purchases.

Food Safety and Quality Control
 
Food safety is the top priority at the Company. Food safety systems include rigorous standards and training of employees in our restaurants and distribution system, as well as requirements for suppliers. These standards and training topics include, but are not limited to, employee health, product handling, ingredient and product temperature management and prevention of cross contamination. Food safety training is focused on illness prevention, food safety and regulation adherence in day-to-day operations. Our standards also promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations in China when building new or renovating existing restaurants. For further information on food safety issues, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.”
 
Our quality assurance department regularly conducts unannounced food safety and operation excellence checks of all restaurants covering food safety, product quality and guest service. We also conduct regular product quality inspections on main menu items, and perform microbiological testing of restaurants’ utensils, small wares, water, ice and food to ensure they meet the required standards.
 
We have established a team managing delivery services for our restaurants. We require all third-party delivery companies to sign and strictly implement a letter of commitment on the food safety and quality practice of delivery food, which stipulates clear requirements for regulatory compliance, staff management, catering, delivery facilities, equipment and strict management of third-party platforms.

Innovation and Digitalization
 
Our vision is to become the world’s most innovative pioneer in the restaurant industry. We are dedicated to adopting innovations in our business model and restaurant operations, which enables us to comprehensively reach our guests and provide superior products and services in a technology-driven and happy way, as vividly demonstrated by our slogan “Tasty food, great fun, pleasant presentation with substance.”
 
We believe we are a pioneer and first-mover among restaurant brands in China in utilizing and investing in emerging digital technologies to modernize our business operations and accelerate our growth, which is critical to empower and maintain our competitive advantage in China. In recent years, we have stepped up our investment in digitalization, embarking on end-to-end digitalization of our business operations. In 2021, we opened a digital R&D center with three sites in Shanghai, Nanjing and Xi’an, to strengthen our internal digital capabilities and support sustainable business growth by using advanced technology.
 
Dining Experience
 
Menu Innovations
 
Offering appealing, tasty and convenient food at great prices is our value proposition. We have a dedicated food innovation team primarily focusing on the development and innovation of new recipes and improvement of existing products. In 2022, we launched over 500 new and improved products across all of our restaurant brands. Leveraging our local know-how and the wealth of consumer taste preference data accumulated, we have become a pioneer in food innovation, pushing the boundaries of QSR and CDR dining in China.

Our menu innovation endeavors are also supported by a world-class 27,000 square-foot innovation center in Shanghai for the development of new recipes, cooking methods and menu concepts. The innovation center is an integrated research and development facility that has been designed to generate new menu ideas and concepts with new ingredients and cooking methods to enable the rapid roll-out of innovative products catering to customers’ local tastes.

Ordering
 
KFC rolled out mobile pre-ordering service on a nationwide basis in December 2016, which allows guests to order online and pick up in store. Pizza Hut launched table-side mobile ordering in 2018, which enables guests to order by scanning a QR code with their mobile phone. Now mobile ordering is a standard feature of our Super Apps including the KFC Super App and the Pizza Hut Super App. Guests can also order through our proprietary mini programs embedded in WeChat. In addition, in certain commercial districts, in-store kiosks provide guests with convenient and fast digital ordering options. We continuously enhance our Super Apps to address the needs of customers and improve their digital experience. For example, in 2022, we launched a smart order system to enhance the customer experience by reducing customer wait times and providing real-time order status. In 2022, digital orders accounted for approximately 89% of KFC and Pizza Hut Company sales.
Payment
 
As early as June 2015, we started to partner with Alipay on digital payment functionalities, making us among the first batch of restaurant chains in China to make mobile payment available to guests. We commenced mobile payment cooperation with WeChat Pay in 2016. Digital payments accounted for an increasing percentage of our Company sales, from 33% in 2016 to 99% in 2022. The increasing percentage indicates broad consumer preference for this feature and reflects our ability to harness the power of technology in our business model. Adoption of digital and mobile payment technologies not only provides a better customer experience by, among other things, reducing guest waiting time and saving guests from having to reach for their wallets or even cellphones, but also reduces staffing needed for cash management and reduces potential risks associated with cash management. In addition to the above business relationships with major third-party mobile payment providers, we developed and launched YUMC Pay in partnership with UnionPay in the first quarter of 2019.
 
Guest loyalty and interaction
 
China has entered into an age of Super Apps, which integrates multiple functions including messaging, e-commerce and payments in a single application by embedding mini programs or providing in-App links to other applications. In early 2016, the KFC Super App was implemented nationwide. Super Apps play a very important role in our overall digital ecosystem as they enable a digital guest experience by offering convenience, efficiency and interesting functionality before, during and after dining.


2022 Form 10-K


Member engagement is fostered through our Super Apps and WeChat mini programs, as these form the primary platform for consumers to sign up for our membership programs. Additionally, we continue to monetize our membership base by introducing privilege membership subscription programs that increase frequency and spend at our brands. These monetization opportunities rely heavily on our ability to engage with our users through our Super Apps. As of December 31, 2022, KFC and Pizza Hut loyalty programs exceeded 410 million members combined. Member sales accounted for approximately 62% of system sales in 2022. We believe that creative and engaging interactions with our guests can help us enhance the guest experience and guest loyalty, which will ultimately lead to increased sales.
Delivery
 
We believe that food delivery is a significant growth driver in China. We were one of the first restaurant businesses in China to offer delivery services. As early as 2010, KFC established its own delivery platform and started to accept delivery orders placed on its mobile applications. Orders generated from our own delivery platforms for KFC and Pizza Hut contributed a significant portion of our delivery sales. Starting from 2015, we were also one of the first to partner with O2O aggregators to further generate delivery traffic. In addition to ordering through aggregators’ platforms, guests may also place delivery orders through the KFC and Pizza Hut Super Apps. The ability to generate orders from our own channels allows us to be well-positioned in commercial collaborations with aggregators, and manage costs and commissions in a more competitive manner.
 
We have established a team managing delivery services for our restaurants. We primarily use dedicated riders, who are managed by third-party delivery companies contracted with us, to deliver orders. These dedicated riders deliver orders exclusively for our stores, which help ensure rider availability during peak hours, delivery quality and timeliness. In 2019, Company sales through delivery accounted for approximately 21% of total Company sales, which further increased to approximately 30% for 2020, 32% in 2021 and 39% in 2022, partially driven by the increased delivery orders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Restaurant Format Innovation
 
To supplement our growth, we are focusing on developing new restaurant formats and upgrading existing restaurants. We have developed multiple restaurant formats to meet different guest needs. For example, our smaller store formats, with reduced store size combined with other cost reduction initiatives, enable us to penetrate further into lower-tier cities and expand more flexibly in higher-tier cities. In addition, we continuously look for ways to improve the guest experience. We continue to refresh the look of our restaurants and remodel with the latest technology, equipment and infrastructure to improve the dining experience. Approximately 73% of KFC restaurant units and 87% of Pizza Hut restaurant units as of December 31, 2022 were remodeled or built in the past five years. Our brands also look to improve efficiency to drive sales growth. For example, we have simplified our menu items and fine-tuned our in-store self-service order kiosks.
Operational Efficiency
 
We have made significant investments to establish an efficient technological infrastructure, which serves as the foundation of our intelligent restaurant network management and facilitates efficient and innovative restaurant operation for all restaurants across our brands. We have adopted AI-enabled technology to analyze and forecast transaction volume so that we can improve labor scheduling and inventory management. For example, the “Super Brain,” an end-to-end AI-enabled system, integrates data from store operations and aids the decision making of restaurant general managers. Moreover, managers and staff are also equipped with self-designed "smart watches", and in some pilot stores, "smart glasses", to closely monitor the real-time ordering and serving procedures of the restaurants and make timely staffing adjustments, which substantially improves management efficiency and guest satisfaction. We believe our digitalization along with automation, the Internet of Things and AI work together to enhance food safety, replace manual work and improve overall store efficiency.
Doing Business in China
 
Risks Related to Doing Business in China
 
Substantially all of our business operations are located in China. Accordingly, we face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties under the complex and evolving PRC laws and regulations, including the following:
 •Changes in Chinese political policies and economic and social policies or conditions may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and may result in our inability to sustain our growth and expansion strategies.

•Uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws, rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us.
 •The audit report included in this Form 10-K is prepared by auditors who are located in China, and in the event the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is unable to inspect our auditors, our common stock will be subject to potential delisting from the New York Stock Exchange.
 •Changes in political, business, economic and trade relations between the United States and China may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 •Fluctuation in the value of RMB may result in foreign currency exchange losses.
 •The increasing focus on environmental sustainability issues may create operational challenges for us, increase our costs and harm our reputation.
 •Interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations by the PRC government on currency conversion and payments of foreign currency and RMB out of mainland China may limit our ability to utilize our cash balances effectively, including making funds held by our China-based subsidiaries unavailable for use outside of mainland China, which could limit or eliminate our ability to pay dividends and affect the value of your investment.
 •Changes in the laws and regulations of China or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations may have a significant impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and may cause the value of our securities to decline.
 •We rely to a significant extent on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our principal operating subsidiaries in China to fund offshore cash requirements.
 •Under the EIT Law, if we are classified as a China resident enterprise for Chinese enterprise income tax purposes, such classification would likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-Chinese stockholders.
 •We and our stockholders face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in China resident enterprises through transfer of non-Chinese-holding companies. Enhanced scrutiny by the Chinese tax authorities may have a negative impact on potential acquisitions and dispositions we may pursue in the future.
 •There may be difficulties in effecting service of legal process, conducting investigations, collecting evidence, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China based on United States or other foreign laws against us and our management.
 •The Chinese government may determine that the variable interest entity structure of Daojia does not comply with Chinese laws on foreign investment in restricted industries.
 •Certain defects caused by non-registration of our lease agreements related to certain properties occupied by us in China may materially and adversely affect our ability to use such properties.
 •Our restaurants are susceptible to risks in relation to unexpected land acquisitions, building closures or demolitions.
 •Any failure to comply with Chinese regulations regarding our employee equity incentive plans may subject Chinese plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.
 •Failure to make adequate contributions to various employee benefit plans as required by Chinese regulations may subject us to penalties.
 •Proceedings instituted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) against certain China-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, could result in our financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act.
 •Chinese regulation of loans to, and direct investment in, Chinese entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may restrict or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our Chinese subsidiaries, which may materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.
 •Regulations regarding acquisitions may impose significant regulatory approval and review requirements, which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions.

Cash Flows
 
Yum China is a Delaware holding company conducting substantially all of its operations in China through its China subsidiaries. Yum China derives substantially all of its revenue through its operations in China, and Yum China indirectly owns, and receives dividends from, its China subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has also generated cash from its global offering in September 2020.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s China subsidiaries distributed approximately $453 million in dividends to the Company’s Hong Kong-incorporated holding companies. Dividends paid by China subsidiaries to their direct offshore parent companies are subject to Chinese withholding income tax at the rate of 10%, but Hong Kong has a tax arrangement with mainland China that provides for a 5% withholding tax on dividends upon meeting certain conditions and requirements. Once distributed outside of mainland China, the funds are freely transferrable. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s Hong Kong subsidiaries did not distribute dividends to the Company’s Delaware holding company.
 
In 2022, Yum China paid cash dividends to stockholders totaling $202 million and repurchased $466 million of its common stock. The source of funds for these dividends and repurchases was cash on hand held outside of mainland China. These dividends to stockholders and repurchases generally had no tax consequence to the Company, but may be taxable (including by way of withholding) to its stockholders. In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into law in the U.S. The IRA contains certain tax measures, including an excise tax of 1% on net share repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022. For more information on our dividends and share repurchases, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.
 
In addition, Yum China makes investments in its China subsidiaries through capital contributions to further support their operational and growth needs. In 2021, one of Yum China’s subsidiaries, which was incorporated in Hong Kong, made capital contributions to its subsidiaries in China totaling approximately $95 million. No such capital contributions were made in 2022. Cash may also be transferred among the Company’s China subsidiaries and their offshore holding companies by means of intercompany loans. No such intercompany loans were made in 2021 and 2022.
 
For more information regarding the Company’s cash flows, see our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and the related notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Cash Management Policies
 
The Company has comprehensive cash management policies in place, including specific policies governing approvals with respect to fund transfers throughout our organization.
 
Our board of directors and the audit committee oversee the Company’s major financial risk exposures. The Company maintains an authorization policy on cash management, setting forth the scope of authority for certain treasury matters that are delegated by the board of directors to management. Under this policy, certain treasury matters, such as intercompany loans, short-term and long-term investments and dividends distributed from the Company’s subsidiaries to the holding company, are clearly defined, with the level of approval required for each matter specifically identified.
 
Our management regularly monitors the liquidity position, funding requirements and investment returns in different jurisdictions of our subsidiaries, and takes into consideration regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which the Company has subsidiaries or operations. When funding is required, all necessary approvals are obtained from Company management and relevant governmental authorities, including China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
 
In addition, our ability to declare and pay any dividends on our stock may be restricted by earnings available for distribution under applicable Chinese laws. See “—Government Regulation—Regulations Relating to Dividend Distribution” for more information.

Government Regulation
 
The Company is subject to various laws affecting its business, including the following:
 •Each of our restaurants in China is required to obtain (1) the relevant food business license; (2) the environmental protection assessment and inspection registration or approval; and (3) the fire safety inspection acceptance approval or other alternatives. Some of our restaurants which sell alcoholic beverages are required to make further registrations or obtain additional approvals, as described under the heading “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—We require various approvals, licenses and permits to operate our business and the loss of or failure to obtain or renew any or all of these approvals, licenses and permits could adversely affect our business and results of operations;”
 •Cash transfers from the Company’s PRC subsidiaries to its subsidiaries outside of China are subject to PRC government control of currency conversion. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of the PRC subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to the Company, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency-denominated obligations. See “—Regulations Relating to Dividend Distribution” and “—Regulations Relating to Taxation” for more information;
 •We are subject to Chinese regulations on loans to and direct investment in Chinese entities by offshore holding companies. Thus, loans by us to our wholly-owned Chinese subsidiaries to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the local counterparts of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”). If we decide to finance our wholly-owned Chinese subsidiaries by means of capital contributions, in practice, we might be still required to obtain approval from China’s Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”) or its local counterparts. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Chinese regulation of loans to, and direct investment in, Chinese entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may restrict or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our Chinese subsidiaries, which may materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business” for more information;
 •We are subject to regulations relating to certain investments and acquisitions relating to businesses in China, including under the PRC Anti-monopoly Law and the Provisions of the Ministry of Commerce on M&A of a Domestic Enterprise by Foreign Investors jointly adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies, including MOFCOM, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the Chinese State Taxation Administration (“STA”), the State Administration for Industry and Commerce of the People’s Republic of China, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) and SAFE. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Regulations regarding acquisitions may impose significant regulatory approval and review requirements, which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions” for more information;
 •We are subject to cybersecurity regulations, including those enforced by the Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”) including the PRC Cybersecurity Law, which imposes tightened requirements on data privacy and cybersecurity practices, the PRC Data Security Law, which imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out data activities (including activities outside of the PRC), requires a national security review of data activities that may affect national security, and imposes restrictions on data transmissions, the PRC Personal Information Protection Law, which sets out the regulatory framework for handling and protection of personal information and transmission of personal information, among others. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Unauthorized access to, or improper use, disclosure, theft or destruction of, our customer or employee personal, financial or other data or our proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could result in substantial costs, expose us to litigation and damage our reputation;” and
2022 Form 10-K


•We may be subject to regulations relating to overseas securities offering and listing of China-based companies, including pursuant to the Opinions on Intensifying Crack Down on Illegal Securities Activities issued by the PRC government authorities, which called for enhanced oversight of overseas listed companies as well as overseas equity fundraising and listing by Chinese companies, and proposed measures such as the construction of regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies; the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies and the supporting guidelines issued by the CSRC, which regulate overseas securities offering and listing activities by China-based companies; the draft Regulations on Network Data Security Management issued by the CAC, which requires, among other things, that a prior cybersecurity review be conducted by the Cybersecurity Review Office before listing overseas for data processors which process over one million users’ personal information, and for the listing in Hong Kong of data processors which affect or may affect national security; the Revised Cybersecurity Review Measures, jointly issued by the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the PRC, and several other administrations, which require, among other things, that a network platform operator holding over one million users’ personal information must apply with the Cybersecurity Review Office for a cybersecurity review before any public offering or listing outside of mainland PRC and Hong Kong. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—The PRC government has significant oversight and discretion to exert control over offerings of our securities conducted outside of China and foreign investment in China-based issuers, and may limit or completely hinder our ability to offer securities to investors, which may cause the value of such securities to significantly decline.”
 
The Company is also subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment, as well as anti-bribery and corruption laws. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. The Company has not historically been materially and adversely affected by such requirements or by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required approvals, licenses, permits, registrations or filings and has obtained all material required approvals. As of the date of this Form 10-K, no material permissions have been denied to us by relevant government authorities in China, and we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanctions regarding our business operations and corporate structure from the CSRC, CAC or any other PRC governmental agency that would have a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. However, we cannot predict the effect that the compliance with laws and regulations may have on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position in the future, or how we may be affected if we do not receive or maintain any required permissions or approvals, inadvertently conclude that such permissions or approvals are not required, or if applicable laws, regulations or interpretations change and we are required to obtain additional permissions or approvals in the future. If (i) we have inadvertently concluded that such permissions, approvals, licenses or permits have been acquired or are not required, or (ii) applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and we are required to obtain such permissions, approvals, licenses or permits in the future, then we may have to expend time and costs to procure them. If we are unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, it could cause significant disruption to our business operations and damage our reputation, which would in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of additional risks relating to federal, state, provincial, local and international governmental regulation of our business.
 
Regulations Relating to Dividend Distribution
 
The Chinese laws, rules and regulations applicable to our China subsidiaries permit payments of dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with applicable accounting standards and regulations. In addition, under Chinese law, an enterprise incorporated in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, after making up previous years’ accumulated losses, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such a fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. As a result, our China subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us in the form of dividends. At the discretion of their board of directors, as enterprises incorporated in China, our China subsidiaries may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on China accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends.
Regulations Relating to Taxation
 
Enterprise Income Tax. Under the China Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”) and its implementation rules, a China resident enterprise is subject to Chinese enterprise income tax in respect of its net taxable income derived from sources inside and outside China. The term “resident enterprise” refers to any enterprise established in China and any enterprise established outside China with a “de facto management body” within China.
2022 Form 10-K


Our China subsidiaries are regarded as China resident enterprises by virtue of their incorporation in China, and are generally subject to Chinese enterprise income tax on their worldwide income at the current uniform rate of 25%, unless reduced under certain specific qualifying criteria. Our China subsidiaries may deduct reasonable expenses that are actually incurred and are related to the generation of their income, including interest and other borrowing expenses, amortization of land use rights and depreciation of buildings and certain fixed assets, subject to any restrictions that may be imposed under the EIT Law, its implementation regulations and any applicable tax notices and circulars issued by the Chinese government or tax authorities.
 
Yum China and each subsidiary of Yum China that is organized outside of China intends to conduct its management functions in a manner that does not cause it to be a China resident enterprise, including by carrying on its day-to-day management activities and maintaining its key records, such as resolutions of its board of directors and resolutions of stockholders, outside of China. As such, we do not believe that Yum China or any of its non-Chinese subsidiaries should be considered a China resident enterprise for purposes of the EIT Law, and should not be subject to Chinese enterprise income tax on that basis. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Under the EIT Law, if we are classified as a China resident enterprise for Chinese enterprise income tax purposes, such classification would likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-Chinese stockholders.”
 
Value-Added Tax and Local Surcharges. Effective on May 1, 2016, a 6% value-added tax (“VAT”) on output replaced the 5% business tax (“BT”) that has historically been applied to certain restaurant sales under the China Provisional Regulations on Business Tax. Pursuant to Circular Caishui [2016] No. 36 jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Chinese State Taxation Administration (“STA”), beginning May 1, 2016, any entity engaged in the provision of catering services in China is generally required to pay VAT at the rate of 6% on revenues generated from the provision of such services, less any creditable VAT already paid or borne by such entity upon purchase of materials and services. Our new retail business is generally subject to VAT rates at 9% or 13%. The latest VAT rates imposed on our purchase of materials and services included 13%, 9% and 6%, which were gradually changed from 17%, 13%, 11% and 6% since 2017. These rate changes impact our input VAT on all materials and certain services, primarily construction, transportation and leasing. However, the impact on our operating results is not expected to be significant. Local surcharges generally ranging from 7% to 13%, varying with the location of the relevant China subsidiary, are imposed on the amount of VAT payable.
 
Repatriation of Dividends from Our China Subsidiaries. Dividends (if any) paid by our China subsidiaries to their direct offshore parent companies are subject to Chinese withholding income tax at the rate of 10%, provided that such dividends are not effectively connected with any establishment or place of the offshore parent company in China. The 10% withholding income tax rate may be reduced or exempted pursuant to the provisions of any applicable tax treaties or tax arrangements. Hong Kong has a tax arrangement with mainland China that provides for a 5% withholding tax on dividends upon meeting certain conditions and requirements, including, among others, that the Hong Kong resident enterprise directly owns at least 25% equity interests of the Chinese enterprise and is a “beneficial owner” of the dividends. We believe that our principal Hong Kong subsidiary, which is the equity holder of our Chinese subsidiaries operating substantially all of our KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants, met the relevant requirements pursuant to the tax arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong in 2018 and is expected to meet the requirements in subsequent years, thus, it is more likely than not that our dividends or earnings expected to be repatriated to this principal Hong Kong subsidiary since 2018 are subject to the reduced withholding tax of 5%. However, if the Hong Kong subsidiary is not considered to be the “beneficial owner” of the dividends by the Chinese local tax authority, the withholding tax rate on dividends paid to it by our Chinese subsidiaries would be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10% with retrospective effect, which would increase our tax liability and reduce the amount of cash available to the Company. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—We rely to a significant extent on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our principal operating subsidiaries in China to fund offshore cash requirements.”

Gains on Direct Disposal of Equity Interests in Our China Subsidiaries. Under the EIT Law and its implementation rules, gains derived by non-resident enterprises from the sale of equity interests in a China resident enterprise are subject to Chinese withholding income tax at the rate of 10%. The 10% withholding income tax rate may be reduced or exempted pursuant to applicable tax treaties or tax arrangements. The gains are computed based on the difference between the sales proceeds and the original investment basis. Stamp duty is also payable upon a direct transfer of equity interest in a China resident enterprise. The stamp duty is calculated at 0.05% on the transfer value, payable by each of the transferor and transferee. We may be subject to these taxes in the event of any future sale by us of a China resident enterprise.


2022 Form 10-K



Gains on Indirect Disposal of Equity Interests in Our China Subsidiaries. In February 2015, the STA issued the STA’s Bulletin on Several Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Income Arising from Indirect Transfers of Property by Non-resident Enterprises (“Bulletin 7”). Pursuant to Bulletin 7, an “indirect transfer” of Chinese taxable assets, including equity interests in a China resident enterprise (“Chinese interests”), by a non-resident enterprise, may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of Chinese taxable assets, if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor avoids payment of Chinese enterprise income tax. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” of Chinese interests by disposing of equity interests in an offshore holding company, the transferor, transferee and/or the China resident enterprise being indirectly transferred may report such indirect transfer to the relevant Chinese tax authority, which may in turn report upward to the STA. Using general anti-tax avoidance provisions, the STA may treat such indirect transfer as a direct transfer of Chinese interests if the transfer avoids Chinese tax by way of an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to Chinese enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer would be obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of up to 10% of the capital gain in the case of an indirect transfer of equity interests in a China resident enterprise. Both the transferor and the party obligated to withhold the applicable taxes may be subject to penalties under Chinese tax laws if the transferor fails to pay the taxes and the party obligated to withhold the applicable taxes fails to withhold the taxes.
 
The above regulations do not apply if either (i) the selling non-resident enterprise recognizes the relevant gain by purchasing and selling equity of the same listed enterprise in the open market (the “listed enterprise exception”); or (ii) the selling non-resident enterprise would have been exempted from enterprise income tax in China pursuant to applicable tax treaties or tax arrangements, if it had directly held and transferred such Chinese interests that were indirectly transferred. The China indirect transfer rules do not apply to gains recognized by individual stockholders. However, in practice, there have been a few reported cases of individuals being taxed on the indirect transfer of Chinese interests and the law could be changed so as to apply to individual stockholders, possibly with retroactive effect. In addition, the PRC Individual Income Tax Law and relevant regulations (“IITL”), revised effective January 1, 2019, impose general anti-avoidance tax rules (“GAAR”) on transactions conducted by individuals. As a result, if the China tax authority invokes the GAAR and deems that indirect transfers made by individual stockholders lack reasonable commercial purposes, any gains recognized on such transfers might be subject to individual income tax in China at the standard rate of 20%.
 
It is unclear whether Company stockholders that acquired Yum China stock through the distribution or the Global Offering (discussed under “—Our History”) will be treated as acquiring Yum China stock in an open market purchase. If such acquisition of Yum China stock is not treated as acquired in an open market purchase, the listed transaction exception will not be available for transfers of such stock. We expect that transfers in open market transactions of our stock by corporate or other non-individual stockholders that have purchased our stock in open market transactions will not be taxable under the China indirect transfer rules due to the listed enterprise exception. Transfers, whether in the open market or otherwise, of our stock by corporate and other non-individual stockholders that acquired our stock in the distribution or the Global Offering or in non-open market transactions may be taxable under the China indirect transfer rules and our China subsidiaries may have filing obligations in respect of such transfers upon the request of relevant Chinese tax authorities. Transfers of our stock in non-open market transactions by corporate and other non-individual stockholders may be taxable under the China indirect transfer rules, whether or not such stock was acquired in open market transactions, and our China subsidiaries may have filing obligations in respect of such transfers upon the request of relevant China tax authorities. Corporate and other non-individual stockholders may be exempt from taxation under the Chinese indirect transfer rules with respect to transfers of our stock if they are tax resident in a country or region that has a tax treaty or arrangement with China that provides for a capital gains tax exemption and they qualify for that exemption.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). In December 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act, which included a broad range of tax reforms, including, but not limited to, the establishment of a flat corporate income tax rate of 21%, the elimination or reduction of certain business deductions, and the imposition of tax on deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings. The Tax Act has impacted Yum China in two material aspects: (1) in general, all of the foreign-source dividends received by Yum China from its foreign subsidiaries will be exempted from taxation starting from the tax year beginning after December 31, 2017 and (2) Yum China recorded additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, including an estimated one-time transition tax on its deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and additional tax related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets. The Tax Act also requires a U.S. shareholder to be subject to tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.
 
The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released the final transition tax regulations in the first quarter of 2019. We completed the evaluation of the impact on our transition tax computation based on the final regulations released in the first quarter of 2019 and recorded additional income tax expense for the transition tax accordingly.
 

2022 Form 10-K


Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”). In August 2022, the IRA was signed into law in the U.S. The IRA contains certain tax measures, including a Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (“CAMT”) of 15% on certain large corporations and an excise tax of 1% on net share repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022. On December 27, 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released Notice 2023-7, announcing their intention to issue proposed regulations addressing the application of the new CAMT. Notice 2023-7 also provides interim guidance regarding certain CAMT issues and states that the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS plan to issue additional interim guidance addressing other issues before publishing proposed regulations.

Hong Kong Profits Tax. Our subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong are generally subject to Hong Kong profits tax at a rate of 16.5%. For the years 2018 and onwards, the first HK$2 million of profits generated by one entity incorporated in Hong Kong is taxed at a rate of 8.25%, while the remaining profits will continue to be taxed at the 16.5% tax rate. In December 2022, a refined Foreign Sourced Income Exemption (“FSIE”) regime was published in Hong Kong and will take effect from January 1, 2023. Under the new FSIE regime, certain foreign soured income would be deemed as being sourced from Hong Kong and chargeable to Hong Kong Profits Tax, if the recipient entity fails to meet the prescribed exception requirements. Certain dividends, interests and disposal gains, if any, received by us and our Hong Kong subsidiaries may be subject to the new tax regime.
 
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation relating to taxation of our business.
 
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act
 
On December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted rules (the “Final Rules”) to implement the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the “HFCAA”), which became law on December 18, 2020. The HFCAA requires the SEC to prohibit the securities of any “covered issuer” from being traded on any of the U.S. securities exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange, or traded “over-the-counter,” if the auditor of the covered issuer’s financial statements is not subject to Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) inspection for three consecutive years, beginning in 2021. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which became law on December 29, 2022, reduced the number of consecutive non-inspection years required to trigger the trading prohibition under the HFCAA from three years to two.
 
On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determination that it was unable to inspect or investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong because of positions taken by Chinese authorities in those jurisdictions. Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG Huazhen LLP, was subject to the determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021.
 
The HFCAA includes requirements for the SEC to identify issuers who file annual reports with audit reports issued by independent registered public accounting firms located in foreign jurisdictions that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by a non-U.S. authority in the accounting firm’s jurisdiction (“Commission-Identified Issuers”). On March 30, 2022, as expected following its adoption of the Final Rules, the SEC added Yum China to its conclusive list of Commission-Identified Issuers. The Final Rules require each Commission-Identified Issuer to submit documentation to the SEC annually on or before its annual report due date that establishes that it is not owned or controlled by a government entity in its public accounting firm’s foreign jurisdiction. The SEC will impose an initial trading prohibition on an issuer as soon as practicable after it has been conclusively identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for two consecutive years.
 
On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it signed a Statement of Protocol with the CSRC and the Ministry of Finance, which it described as the first step toward opening access for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate completely registered public accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB vacated its 2021 determination that the positions taken by authorities in mainland China and Hong Kong prevented it from inspecting and investigating completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in those jurisdictions.
 
In view of the PCAOB’s decision to vacate its 2021 determination and until such time as the PCAOB issues any new adverse determination, the SEC has stated that there are no issuers at risk of having their securities subject to a trading prohibition under the HFCAA. However, whether the PCAOB will continue to be able to satisfactorily conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong is subject to uncertainty and depends on a number of factors out of our control. If the PCAOB again becomes unable to conduct a full inspection of our independent registered public accounting firm’s audit documentation related to their audit reports, then our common stock will again be subject to potential delisting from the New York Stock Exchange.

For more information regarding the risks to the Company from the HFCAA, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—The audit report included in this Form 10-K is prepared by auditors who are located in China, and in the event the PCAOB is unable to inspect our auditors, our common stock will be subject to potential delisting from the New York Stock Exchange.”
Intellectual Property
 
Our use of certain material trademarks and service marks is governed by a master license agreement between Yum Restaurants Consulting (Shanghai) Company Limited (“YCCL”), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, and Yum! Brands Inc. (“YUM”), through YRI China Franchising LLC, a subsidiary of YUM, effective from January 1, 2020 and previously through Yum! Restaurants Asia Pte. Ltd., another subsidiary of YUM, from October 31, 2016 to December 31, 2019. Pursuant to the master license agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of the KFC, Pizza Hut and, subject to achieving certain agreed-upon milestones, Taco Bell brands and their related marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in the PRC, excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. The term of the license is 50 years from October 31, 2016 for the KFC and Pizza Hut brands and, subject to achieving certain agreed-upon milestones, 50 years from April 15, 2022 for the Taco Bell brand, with automatic renewals for additional consecutive renewal terms of 50 years each, subject only to us being in “good standing” and unless we give notice of our intent not to renew. In exchange, we pay a license fee to YUM equal to 3% of net system sales of the licensed brands. We have also agreed generally not to compete with YUM. In addition, we were granted a right of first refusal to develop and franchise in the PRC certain restaurant concepts that YUM may develop or acquire. On April 15, 2022, the Company and YUM, through their respective subsidiaries, entered into an amendment to the master license agreement to amend the development milestones for the Taco Bell brand. We have satisfied the measurement condition for the end of 2022, and we are committed to expanding the Taco Bell store network to at least 225 stores by the end of 2025. Subject to achieving these milestones, the Company will have the exclusive right to operate and sublicense the Taco Bell brand in China for 50 years.
 
We were granted by YUM a royalty-free license to use the name and mark of “YUM” as part of our name, domain name and stock identification symbol pursuant to a name license agreement entered into between YUM and us on October 31, 2016. The name license agreement can be terminated by YUM in the event of, among other things, material breach of the agreement by us. Our use of certain other material intellectual property (including intellectual property in product recipes, restaurant operation and restaurant design) is likewise governed by the master license agreement with YUM.

We own registered trademarks and service marks relating to the Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang, COFFii & JOY and East Dawning brands and pay no license fee related to these brands. Collectively, these licensed and owned marks have significant value and are important to our business. Our policy is to pursue registration of our important intellectual property rights whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our rights.
 
Competition
 
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China indicates that sales in the consumer food service market in China totaled approximately $655 billion in 2022. Industry conditions vary by region, with local Chinese restaurants and western chains present, but we possess the largest market share (as measured by system sales). While branded QSR units per million population in China are well below that of the United States, competition in China is increasing. We compete with respect to food taste, quality, value, service, convenience, restaurant location and concept, including delivery and shared kitchens. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and disposable income. We compete not only for consumers but also for management and hourly personnel and suitable restaurant sites. KFC’s competitors in China are primarily western QSR brands such as McDonald’s, Dicos and Burger King, and to a lesser extent, domestic QSR brands in China. Pizza Hut primarily competes with western CDR brands, including Domino’s and Papa John’s, as well as other domestic CDR brands in China.
Seasonality
 
Due to the nature of our operations, we typically generate higher sales during Chinese festivities, holiday seasons as well as summer months, but relatively lower sales and lower operating profit during the second and fourth quarters.
Human Capital Management
 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had more than 400,000 employees, including approximately 145,000 full-time employees and approximately 261,000 part-time restaurant crew members. Our full-time employees primarily included 34,000 restaurant management team members and 103,000 restaurant crew members.
2022 Form 10-K


Our board of directors provides oversight on certain human capital matters, including inclusion and diversity, management succession planning, and our employee rewards and benefits program. Under the board’s oversight, the Company regularly conducts a people planning review to attract, retain and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and strategies.
Culture and People Philosophy
 
The Company is committed to the “People First” philosophy by implementing our principle of “Fair, Care, Pride.” In 2022, we released our Human Rights Policy, highlighting our commitment to create a workplace and a community that respect and protect human rights, which includes providing a discrimination-free and harassment-free workplace, ensuring fair compensation, creating a safe and healthy working environment, encouraging a diverse and inclusive culture, equipping employees with future employability, respecting employees’ freedom of association, prohibiting child labor and forced labor and engaging with the communities we serve and our stakeholders. Our Human Rights Policy is consistent with Yum China’s Code of Conduct.

Environmental Matters
 
We strive to reduce the environmental impact of our business activities by incorporating sustainability into the daily operations of our restaurants, as well as focusing our efforts on climate action, circular economy and supply chain environmental impact.
Climate Action

Our commitment to enhance climate action tops the list of our environmental sustainability priorities. We are committed to reaching net-zero value chain GHG emissions by 2050, and have set near-term science-based targets (SBTs) by 2035.

Our near-term SBTs are:
 •Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 63% by 2035 from a 2020 base year.
 •Reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods 66.3% per ton of goods purchased by 2035 from a 2020 base year.
 
We have developed a 1.5°C-aligned decarbonization strategy and roadmap, focusing on energy efficiency improvement, renewable energy investment and supplier engagement. We identified and assessed climate-related risks and opportunities in our operations and value chain in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (“TCFD”), and released our first TCFD report in 2022. In 2022, we also participated in the CDP Questionnaire for the second year.
 
Circular Economy
 
Food Loss and Waste

We are working toward the goal of a 10% reduction of our food waste per restaurant by 2030, as compared to a 2020 baseline, by exploring innovative initiatives for food loss reduction across different stages of the value chain. For example, we use AI/IoT technology to improve sales forecasting accuracy and inventory management, increase the proportion of cold chain transportation and use smaller fryers to avoid excessive cooking. We continue to promote and extend our food bank project by establishing pick-up stations at more restaurants under more brands, providing surplus food for free to residents in need. We also strive to explore solutions to recycle and reuse waste, such as recycling used cooking oil as resources in the Company’s value chain through collaboration with various stakeholders.
Sustainable Packaging
 
We continue to reduce packaging and waste through design optimization, material replacement, and innovative application methods. We are committed to ensuring that 100% of customer facing, plastic-based packaging is recyclable. We are working toward our target of a 30% reduction of non-degradable plastic packaging weight by 2025, as compared to a 2019 baseline.
Supply Chain Environmental Impact
 
Building a sustainable supply chain is a key component of our sustainability strategy. We have set an ambitious goal to achieve a zero-deforestation supply chain. By continuously strengthening traceability in the upstream supply chain, we strive to source in a sustainable way, including our goal of sourcing 100% RSPO-certified palm oil, as well as 100% FSC-certified paper packaging by 2025.
