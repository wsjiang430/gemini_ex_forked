Our Mission
 Our mission is to empower researchers and clinicians to advance science and medicine. The genomic technologies developed over the last two decades, since the first sequencing of the human genome, have greatly improved our understanding of biology, empowered the development of novel therapies and advanced clinical diagnostics. Yet, the potential of genomics is just starting to be realized. Today’s sequencing technologies have made a significant impact, but limitations remain to incorporate these tools into routine clinical practice: long analysis times, labor-intensive protocols, sample-batching requirements and high cost. We are developing powerful, fast, flexible and accurate sequencing products, along with novel applications and sample-to-result workflows, to solve these challenges.
 We believe the next generation of biological discovery and translational medicine will be powered by even more advanced molecular technologies. These technologies will enable a high-resolution view of DNA, RNA and proteins in individual cells, including their spatial arrangement. This view, called multiomics, will enable greater insight into the function of cells and tissues. We are building multiomics technologies by leveraging our core DNA sequencing engine, which uses molecular biology techniques and the latest advances in high-speed, high-resolution imaging.
Our goal is to unleash the power of sequencing as a universal reader of biology, which we believe will open new frontiers in research and medicine.
Overview
 We are a life science technology company that develops next-generation sequencing and multiomics technologies. The commercially available G4 Sequencing Platform (the “G4”) is a powerful, highly versatile benchtop genomic sequencer designed to produce fast and accurate results. Our second product in development, the PX system (the “PX”), leverages our proprietary sequencing technology, applying it as an in situ readout to look at RNA and proteins in single cells and tissue. With these products, our mission is to empower researchers and clinicians to advance science and medicine.
 We developed a unique and proprietary NGS technology, which we refer to as our Sequencing Engine. This Sequencing Engine is the platform technology of our products and core product tenets: power, speed, flexibility and accuracy. The core of our Sequencing Engine is comprised of unique and proprietary chemistry, including novel chemical compounds, polymers and enzymes. This chemistry is designed to produce high-accuracy sequencing and rapid cycle times that we believe can drive improvements in NGS. To take full advantage of our proprietary chemistry, we have developed and continue to develop purpose-built instrumentation consisting of high-speed, high-resolution imaging and innovative fluidic design. We believe that our Sequencing Engine, together with our proprietary innovations in molecular biology techniques, will enable differentiated applications in fast-growing markets, supported by our intellectual property portfolio.
 The G4 is a benchtop next-generation sequencer designed to produce fast and accurate sequencing results. The G4 is designed to target the NGS market in particular applications that require power, speed, flexibility and accuracy. We believe the G4 will expand and accelerate the use of DNA sequencing across a wide range of applications, such as identifying cancer-associated genetic mutations, deep sequencing to detect minimum residual disease in circulating cell-free DNA, profiling the immune system, analyzing single-cell RNA transcription and rapidly sequencing exomes and whole genomes. We are executing a three-step commercialization plan for the G4 consisting of the following: (i) collaborating with select partners to conduct beta pilot tests, which we completed in 2021; (ii) collaborating with potential customers in our early access program, which we concluded in the second quarter of 2022; and (iii) offering the G4 broadly to the market. We commercially launched the G4 in December of 2021, and we began recognizing revenue on sales of the G4 in the fourth quarter of 2022.
 The PX is our second product in development and is a multiomics platform designed to target the markets for single-cell, spatial analysis and proteomics. The PX will leverage our Sequencing Engine as a readout mechanism to provide a high-resolution view of biology at the single-cell and tissue level. We believe the PX, when launched, will be a high-throughput, versatile platform capable of measuring levels of RNA transcription, protein expression and sequence-specific information directly in cells and tissues. We believe the PX will have broad application across many areas of biology. We are initially focused on applications in oncology and immunology, with future expansion into other applications such as neurology. We are currently in an advanced prototype development stage for the PX. For the PX, we plan to collaborate with select partners to conduct a technology access program designed to bring samples and collaborators in-house, which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2022 and executed our first technology access partner agreement in February 2023. Following our technology access program, we plan to expand collaborations with additional potential customers in an early access program.


Sequencing Engine
 Our Sequencing Engine is the platform technology of our products. The core of the Sequencing Engine is a novel and proprietary sequencing-by-synthesis (“SBS”) chemistry that enables high-accuracy sequencing and rapid cycle times that we believe will drive improvements in NGS. The Sequencing Engine enables performance of highly accurate and massively parallel sequencing at speed. We built the Sequencing Engine from the ground up, and it incorporates the following innovations:
•Cluster amplification: We have developed an optimized cluster amplification method that is designed to ensure generation of high-quality and high-density clusters with minimal sequence bias and high signal-to-background ratios. This enables high-accuracy sequencing regardless of the type of genetic input material.
 •Paired-read sequencing: We have developed a novel method to read DNA from both ends of the fragment, called paired-read sequencing. We believe our method is fast and efficient with reagent usage, while providing efficient mapping and detection of gene rearrangements, higher-quality data and single-cell genomics.
 •Sequencing chemistry: We have developed a new and proprietary sequencing chemistry. This chemistry includes novel enzymes and nucleotides. We have also designed and synthesized our own dyes to optimize performance. This new and proprietary chemistry enables fast sequencing cycle times. 
 •Detection technology: We have developed a proprietary high-speed and high-resolution imaging system. The imaging system has been designed to optimize throughput, cycle time, accuracy and efficiency.
Our Products
 Our product pipeline comprises two products, each is designed to leverage the Sequencing Engine and purpose-built to address different applications. Our first product, the G4, targets the NGS market. Our second product in development, the PX, combines single cell analysis, spatial analysis, genomics and proteomics in one integrated instrument to offer a versatile multiomics solution. The G4 and PX are each comprised of an instrument and an associated menu of consumable kits.
 G4
 We surveyed numerous labs and key opinion leaders while developing the G4 to listen to their needs and to identify the limitations of current solutions. In parallel, we engineered an instrument around the Sequencing Engine to address those real-world needs. The G4 consists of our G4 instrument and associated consumables and is designed to seamlessly fit into existing workflows, including library preparation up front and bioinformatics on the back end. It is also designed to provide flexibility in terms of scalable sample volumes with the use of one to four flow cells in a sequencing run. We believe this design will enable customers to better manage a wide range of daily sample volume demands without sacrificing turnaround times or incurring extra expenses from inefficient reagent kit use. We are targeting applications for which we believe power, speed, flexibility and accuracy matter, and where our novel molecular biology methods offer unique advantages.
 Capabilities of the G4
The G4 is designed with the following capabilities:
 •Power: We designed the G4 with four flow cells, which we expect will be able to provide over 100 gigabase throughput on each flow cell per run depending on consumable kit and application. This is enough power to sequence a whole genome at 30x coverage on each flow cell in a single run.
 •Speed: We optimized our novel and proprietary chemistry to achieve fast cycle times and built optics and fluidics to leverage it. The G4 is able to achieve cycle times of approximately 2.5 minutes.
 •Flexibility: The G4 has four flow cells. No other sequencer has this type of flexibility that allows a researcher or clinician to run one, two, three or four flow cells at a time on one instrument on a daily basis.
 •Quality and Accuracy: Q30 quality is considered to be the “gold standard” for a sequencer. The G4 provides Q30 or higher quality on 80%−90% of base reads and achieves accuracy of 99.6%−99.9% for 150 base reads.
 •Paired-read sequencing: Our novel method currently allows for flexible read length paired-read sequencing of up to 2x150 cycles.
•Read lengths: The G4 can sequence in common read configurations for the most common applications and support up to 2x150 read lengths.
 •Workflow: We have designed the G4 for customers to efficiently switch to our products. The upstream workflow and downstream analysis are compatible with many current NGS applications, and to enable this efficiency we have partnered with industry-leading library preparation and data-analysis organizations.


Specialized Applications for the G4
 We believe that the G4 has broad potential application across various markets. Additional targeted applications for the G4 include multiple short-read applications with Max Read kits, rare variant detection with high-definition sequencing (“HD-Seq”) and detection of gene fusions with unknown partners or breakpoints with Ring-Seq.
 •Max Read kits for single cell sequencing: Next generation sequencing of short reads has enabled advances in a wide variety of applications, including detection and quantification of RNA in biological samples, cell-free DNA fragment detection and counting, high-throughput NGS barcode sequencing, CRISPR-screens, single-cell analysis, proteomics and others. Short-read NGS is typically performed with one set of single-end or paired-end reads on a single flow cell. Our Max Read kit in development enables multiple sets of independent single-end or paired-end reads on the same flow cell. Compared to conventional NGS formats, this workflow enables higher output of short reads for the same flow cell, without a significant impact on read quality. The Max Read kits boost the potential output of the G4 on single cell applications to an unprecedented 3.2 billion reads per run on a benchtop system.
 •Rare variant detection with HD-Seq: We designed the G4 to support HD-Seq, a unique library prep kit and sequencing method for double-stranded DNA in order to provide higher accuracy than standard single-strand NGS sequencing methods. HD-Seq is expected to enable rare variant detection with higher efficiency and lower costs and is intended to achieve accuracy levels of Q50, which can help differentiate a real mutation from random errors. Accuracy is especially important in oncology for the detection of somatic mutations, including rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms. It is also critical in liquid biopsy where the frequency of mutations in a sample is extremely low. The development of HD-Seq kits is in our product roadmap for future release.
•Gene fusion detection with Ring-Seq: Gene fusions are an important and actionable type of genetic aberration in cancer. We are developing an elegant, novel method (“Ring-Seq”) for the targeted detection of gene fusions, including those with unknown partners or breakpoints. The method aims to deliver the sensitivity and speed of traditional multiplex polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”)–based assays, but with the ability to detect gene fusions with unknown partners or breakpoints. The method includes an innovative wild-type suppression mechanism to increase sequencing efficiency, resulting in reduced sequencing cost per sample. 
 •Extended range sequencing: Other possible applications include extended range sequencing (“XR-Seq”), which would facilitate longer gene sequence reads of up to 3,000 base pairs and support comprehensive analysis of the immune system, particularly the adaptive immune response consisting of B- and T-cells. Based on our analysis of the market opportunity for this technology, including feedback from potential customers, we have reprioritized the development efforts of our other technologies ahead of XR-Seq.
 



PX
 The PX in development is focused on the single cell and spatial analysis markets and consists of the PX instrument and associated consumables. The PX leverages our Sequencing Engine as both a universal detection method and in situ sequencing to enable multiomics analysis of single cells and tissues. The PX is designed to provide high-throughput analysis of nucleic acids and proteins, while also generating high-resolution images of cellular morphology to enable analysis of cellular phenotypes together with spatial context. We believe the PX will eliminate the need for customers to employ multiple systems over several-day workflows, which is required by existing commercial methods. We believe this will enable researchers to perform large-scale experiments that may fundamentally advance our understanding of biology, and, in turn, advance human health.
Capabilities of the PX
 We are designing the PX to have the following characteristics, which we believe are important differentiating characteristics of single-cell and spatial analysis approaches:
 •Multiomics detection: We are developing the PX to identify specific RNA and proteins targets using our Sequencing Engine either as a universal detection method or for in situ sequencing. Additionally, we will provide imaging data of cellular morphology (in the case of single-cell analysis) and tissue organization (in the case of spatial analysis). We believe this combination of molecular and phenotypic data will provide significantly more information than is available today with current commercial technologies. The addition of the cellular morphology along with spatial organization of biomolecules within the tissue microenvironment can provide a data-rich solution across many research applications to better understand cell development, maturation and pathogenesis. We believe that the combination of these useful datasets from individual cells will provide a more complete cellular picture as it will combine both phenotypic data along with detailed molecular characterization.
 •High throughput and large scale: We are designing the PX to be high throughput in order to enable researchers to perform large-scale studies that are currently inaccessible but are needed for a more complete characterization and understanding of biology. Current commercially available single cell technologies detect up to 1 million cells in an experiment. The PX will use a well-plate approach designed to process 10,000 to 100,000 cells per well at a throughput of 1 million to 10 million cells in a single run on its 96 well plate. We believe that this will meet the growing need in this market to study millions of cells and the large scale that is currently unattainable today. Similarly, in the spatial market, current commercially available spatial analysis instruments with similar plex (number of target analytes per panel) profiles can run an experiment involving up to 20 tissue samples per day. With the PX, we expect to run up to 96 tissue samples per day, providing researchers with the ability to run at a scale that is not possible today.
 •High resolution: The PX will be designed to resolve molecules at the single-cell level including subcellular localization of targets. We anticipate that this will enable researchers to differentiate between single cells to truly understand cellular characterization. 
 •Targeted panels: We believe that current discovery efforts with bulk sequencing will lead to translational panels that are targeted on key genes of interest. The PX will be designed for larger-scale studies that will process a higher number of samples with these focused panels.
 Applications for the PX
We are developing the PX to have a broad set of applications in single-cell and tissue analysis. Examples of applications for the PX may include and are not limited to the following:
•Single cell gene expression and proteomics: Targeted gene expression panels and protein panels for specific applications to measure RNA and proteins in combination with morphology data.
•In situ RNA sequencing: In situ sequencing of selected gene targets directly within each cell or tissue while also simultaneously providing phenotype data.
 •Spatial RNA and proteomics applications for tissue: Targeted panels (with customization available) for specific basic and translational research applications to measure gene transcription and protein expression within tissue and then link this information to additional phenotypic data to help provide biological context.
 Key Disease Areas for the PX
 We are designing the PX to have broad applicability across multiple large disease areas. Although our initial applications will focus on indications across oncology and immunology, we are designing the PX to possess the foundational technology and capabilities to potentially address additional areas, including neurology and developmental biology. We believe that key existing biological challenges can be addressed through improved multiomics information, higher sample throughput and enhanced spatial context, which we intend to address through the PX. The following large disease areas are examples of where we are designing the PX to address significant challenges.

•Oncology: We believe the PX will be ideally suited to study blood cancers initially. We are designing the PX to enable the mapping of the progression of blood cancers as they develop, pre- and post-treatment, to fully characterize them across multiple molecular markers. The cellular phenotype, including morphology, could be valuable in helping to further characterize these cancer cells along with the molecular data of gene expression. We anticipate that the coupling of molecular data with the cellular phenotype and morphology can help to drive further understanding and identification of different types of cancer as well as provide the ability to interpret biological function.
 •Immunology: We anticipate that our in situ sequencing will be valuable for identifying the paired receptor data (light and heavy chains in B-cells or alpha and beta chains in T-cells) that is currently lacking at scale today. By having a high-throughput method that will sequence and retain the linkage of the two chains of the immune receptors, we believe researchers will be able to study the immune repertoire in more depth while also correlating each cell with its cellular phenotype or studying the spatial context of the immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, we believe that we will be able to use a DNA-conjugated antibody that recognizes the antigen to confirm the immune cell is binding to a specific antigen. We anticipate this combination of data can provide powerful information to interpret biological function as well as to further characterize immune cell types.
  Markets
 We believe our product pipeline targets multiple market opportunities across life sciences. Due to the comprehensive capability to analyze biology that we are designing into our products, we anticipate that much of this opportunity will be available to us. We estimate that the G4 and the PX target substantial market opportunities such as NGS, single cell, spatial analysis, proteomics and potential new markets.
We plan to initially sell and market our products for research use only (“RUO”) to academic institutions, life sciences and research laboratories, and biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for non-diagnostic and non-clinical purposes. Additionally, CLIA-certified laboratories are able to develop laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”) using RUO products. Today, a significant majority of NGS-based diagnostic tests are performed as LDTs on DNA sequencers that are labeled for RUO. While our initial products are intended for RUO, our longer-term plans include seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) clearance for in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) products and corresponding clearances in other countries.
Commercialization
 Our business model focuses on first driving customer adoption of the G4, followed by the PX. We believe customer adoption will then form a base of users who in turn drive an ongoing revenue stream by purchasing our consumables. We plan to focus our commercial efforts on: (i) expanding the installed base of the G4 and planned PX across a wide array of customer segments; and (ii) driving applications, scale of experimentation and discoveries that lead to increasing utilization of our products by our customers. Similar to our strategy of developing purpose-built products based on feedback from potential customers, we are developing a service and support organization that focuses on creating an unparalleled customer experience.
 We are executing a three-step commercialization plan for the G4 consisting of the following: (i) collaborating with select partners to conduct beta pilot tests, which we completed in 2021; (ii) collaborating with potential customers in our early access program, which we concluded in the second quarter of 2022; and (iii) offering the G4 broadly to the market. We commercially launched the G4 in December of 2021, and we began recognizing revenue on sales of the G4 in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the PX, we plan to collaborate with select partners to conduct a technology access program designed to bring samples and collaborators in-house, which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2022 and executed our first technology access partner agreement in February 2023. Following our technology access program, we plan to expand collaborations with additional potential customers in an early access program.
We have built and are continuing to expand our commercial organization to have direct commercial staff in sales, customer support, applications support, field service and marketing and communications. As we continue our commercial rollout, we will need to scale each function within our commercial organization in anticipation of demand and with the intent to deliver exceptional customer experiences. We believe that coupling customer experience with a transformative integrated solution will allow us to deliver substantial value to our customers, build long-term customer loyalty and enhance our competitive differentiation. Additionally, as part of our commercialization strategy, we plan to provide flexible purchase offerings to customers such as in the form of leases, reagent rentals and subscriptions, and we plan to provide discounts to certain customers or other sales incentives, including bulk purchases such as the G4x4, where we package four G4 instruments to be sold together at a discount.
 We have initially targeted customers in North America through direct sales and customer support organizations. We also plan to expand outside North America to sell and support our products in the European Union, United Kingdom, Asia Pacific and Japan, and expect to expand access to our products in other geographies through well established distribution networks.


Competition
The life sciences market is highly competitive. There are other companies, both established and early-stage, that have indicated that they are designing, manufacturing and marketing products for, among other things, genomics analysis, single-cell analysis and spatial analysis. These companies include 10x Genomics Inc., Becton, Dickinson and Company, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Illumina Inc., MissionBio Inc., Nanostring Technologies, Inc., Oxford Nanopore Technologies Inc., Pacific Biosciences Inc., Element Biosciences, Inc., Ultima Genomics, Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., each of which has products or products in development that compete or could compete to varying degrees with some but not all of our product solutions, as well as a number of other emerging and established companies. Some of these companies may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, including larger research and development staff or more established marketing and sales forces. Other competitors are in the process of developing novel technologies for the life sciences market which may lead to products that rival or replace our products. However, we believe we are significantly differentiated from our competitors for many reasons, including our novel, proprietary Sequencing Engine.
Research and Development
 The goal of our research and development programs is to accelerate genomics for the advancement of science and medicine. To this end, we focus our research and development efforts on the following areas: improving the performance of our core Sequencing Engine; developing new applications for the G4; developing the PX; and enabling future instruments. Our research and development teams are located in our headquarters in San Diego, California. As of December 31, 2022, we had 134 employees in research and development.
Intellectual Property
 Developing and maintaining a strong intellectual property position is an important element of our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products, technologies and our brand. We utilize a variety of intellectual property protection strategies, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other methods of protecting proprietary information.
 Our patent strategy seeks broad patent protection on new developments in sequencing technology in addition to new implementations and applications of our technology. The intellectual property portfolio includes patents and pending patent applications that generally relate to the following areas: chemistry (e.g., nucleotides, dyes and polymers); enzymes; nucleic acid sequencing and amplification methodologies; systems, devices and software; spatial analysis; and applications of our technology.
  As of December 31, 2022, we own or exclusively license twenty-two (22) issued U.S. Utility patents, two (2) issued U.S. Design patents, sixty-four (64) pending U.S. Utility patent applications, nine (9) pending U.S. Design patent applications, eleven (11) issued European Registered Community Design Certificates, nineteen (19) pending European patent applications, one (1) issued Other International (i.e., Australia, Canada, China, Israel, and/or Japan) Design patent, fifteen (15) pending Other International patent applications, twenty-four (24) pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent applications, and forty-five (45) pending U.S. Provisional patent applications. The pending European patent applications were filed in the European Patent Organization (EPO), designating all thirty-eight (38) member countries. Our U.S. owned patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2038 and 2042, in each case without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees.
 Of these, we exclusively license from The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York (“Columbia”) one (1) issued U.S. patent, four (4) pending U.S. Utility patent applications, one (1) pending European patent application, and certain materials and technical information provided by Columbia. The pending European patent application was filed in the EPO, designating all thirty-eight (38) member countries. These patent applications are directed to compositions and methods for sequencing utilizing nucleotides containing disulfide linkers. Our in-licensed patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2036 and 2037, in each case without considering any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees.
  In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, products and technologies, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality agreements, and continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities, to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, some elements of manufacturing processes such as our nucleotide synthesis and flow cell assembly, analytic techniques and assays, imaging and optics implementations, as well as computational algorithms and related processes and software, are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how that are not publicly disclosed. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products.

We do not intend our use or display of other entities’ trade names, trademarks or service marks to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, any other entity.
 Columbia License Agreement
 In August 2016, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Columbia. The License Agreement includes a number of diligence obligations that require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, discover, develop and market Patent Products and/or Other Products (as defined in the License Agreement) by certain dates. Under the License Agreement, we pay an annual license fee that increases each year, until it reaches a low six-digit fee for the fifth year, and for each subsequent year, for so long as the License Agreement remains in force. For any products within the scope of the License Agreement that we commercialize, we are required to pay royalties ranging from low to mid-single digits on net sales of Patent Products and low single-digit royalty rates on net sales of Other Products. We can credit our yearly annual license fee against any yearly royalty fees payable to Columbia. Additionally, if we receive any income in connection with any sublicenses, we must pay Columbia a high single-digit percentage of that income. Finally, the License Agreement provides for payments to Columbia based on our achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones, which could total up to $3.9 million over the life of the License Agreement. We have accrued approximately $0.4 million toward these milestones as of December 31, 2022. During each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company paid approximately $0.1 million to Columbia pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement.
 Suppliers and Manufacturing
The majority of our consumable products and instruments are manufactured in-house at our facilities in San Diego, California. These manufacturing operations include the following: instrument assembly and testing, flow cell surface synthesis and flow cell assembly, reagent formulation and cartridge filling, kit assembly and packaging as well as analytical and functional quality control testing. We obtain many components of our instruments and consumables from third-party suppliers. While some of these components are sourced from a single supplier, we have qualified second sources for several of our critical components. However, during 2022, we had experienced delays in the scale-up of our manufacturing process driven in-part by the availability of certain components from our third-party suppliers.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 275 full-time employees, many of whom are based at our headquarters in San Diego, California. Of these employees, 134 were in research and development, 69 were in operations, 26 were in commercial, and 46 were in general and administration. Among our full-time employees, 117 hold advanced degrees in their field of expertise, including 60 who hold doctoral degrees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Talent Acquisition and Retention
 We recognize that our employees are the primary engine of our success. We support business growth by seeking to attract, retain, and engage best-in-class talent. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled candidates across the U.S. In 2022, we were successful in hiring key positions throughout the organization that we believe will help accelerate our growth.
Compensation and Benefits
 Our compensation philosophy is focused on investing in our workforce by offering competitive and fair compensation and benefits packages. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, short-term incentives such as annual bonuses and commissions, and long-term equity awards. We also offer comprehensive employee benefits, such as life, disability and health insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid parental leave, an employee stock purchase program and a 401(k) plan. We strive to be an employer of choice in our industry by providing market-competitive compensation and benefits packages.
Health, Safety and Wellness
 The health, safety and wellness of our employees is a priority. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and wellness programs. Program benefits are intended to provide our employees with peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that may impact their financial wellbeing.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had adopted a broad approach to increased safety, including requirements for the wearing of masks and for physical distancing, increased cleaning, readily available hand sanitizing stations, providing personal protective equipment, widespread signage and messaging reminding employees of the importance of these measures and other steps. We also supported access to testing by holding on-site testing clinics available to employees and their family members. We will continue to seek health and safety programs to educate and assist employees when possible.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 We believe a diverse workforce is critical to our success. To this end, among other initiatives, we established our employee-led Inclusion Council in 2022. The mission of the Inclusion Council is to create a culture of belonging that fosters connectedness, encourages authentic communication and challenges biases. Through these programs, we aim to provide our employees with an inclusive working environment and opportunities for them to achieve their goals.
Training and Development
 We believe in encouraging employees to become lifelong learners by providing ongoing learning and leadership training opportunities. Our scaled learning platform of on-demand and virtual classroom learning focuses on personal and professional development. We also strive to provide real-time recognition of employee performance. Additionally, our formal annual review process is used to determine pay and equity adjustments to recognize individual contributions, as well as identify areas where training and development may be needed.
Employee Communication and Engagement
 We value open and direct communication with our employees about their experiences and use a variety of channels to obtain employee feedback, including employee surveys. Our annual employee survey provides us with actionable data at the company, department and managerial level, with upward feedback on performance against expectations. Each year, the input received through these surveys is used to help evolve our working environment and strengthen our culture.
Regulatory
 The development, testing, manufacturing, marketing, post-market surveillance, distribution, advertising and labeling of certain of medical devices are subject to regulation in the United States by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”) and comparable state and international agencies. The FDA defines a medical device as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent or other similar or related article, including any component part or accessory, which is (i) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or (ii) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. Medical devices to be commercially distributed in the United States must receive from the FDA either clearance of a premarket notification, known as 510(k), premarket approval, or PMA, or authorization through a de-novo petition pursuant to the FDC Act prior to marketing, unless subject to an exemption.
We intend to label and sell our products for research use only (“RUO”) and expect to sell our products to academic institutions, life sciences and research laboratories that conduct research, and biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for non-diagnostic and non-clinical purposes. Our products are not intended or promoted for use in clinical practice in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, and they are labeled for research use only, not for use in diagnostic procedures. Accordingly, we believe our products, as we intend to market them, generally are not subject to regulation by the FDA. Rather, while FDA regulations require that research use only products be labeled with – “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” – the regulations do not subject such products to the FDA’s jurisdiction or the broader pre- and post-market controls for medical devices.


In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance on RUO labeled products, which, among other things, reaffirmed that a company may not make any clinical or diagnostic claims about an RUO product, stating that merely including a labeling statement that the product is for research purposes only will not necessarily render the device exempt from the FDA’s clearance, approval, or other regulatory requirements if the totality of circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicates that the manufacturer knows its product is being used by customers for diagnostic uses or the manufacturer intends such a use. These circumstances may include, among other things, written or verbal marketing claims regarding a product’s performance in clinical diagnostic applications and a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for such activities. If the FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that our products labeled and marketed for RUO are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be considered medical devices that will require clearance or approval prior to commercialization. Further, sales of devices for diagnostic purposes may subject us to additional healthcare regulation. We continue to monitor the changing legal and regulatory landscape to ensure our compliance with any applicable rules, laws and regulations.
 In the future, certain of our products or related applications could become subject to regulation as medical devices by the FDA. If we wish to label and expand product lines to address the diagnosis of disease, regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries will become an increasingly significant factor in development, testing, production and marketing. Products that we may develop in the molecular diagnostic markets, depending on their intended use, may be regulated as medical devices or in vitro diagnostic products (“IVDs”) by the FDA and comparable agencies in other countries. In the U.S., if we market our products for use in performing clinical diagnostics, such products would be subject to regulation by the FDA under pre-market and post-market control as medical devices, unless an exemption applies, we would be required to obtain either prior 510(k) clearance or prior premarket approval from the FDA before commercializing the product. If we are required to submit our products for pre-market review by the FDA, we may be required to delay marketing and commercialization while we obtain premarket clearance or approval from the FDA. There would be no assurance that we could ever obtain such clearance or approval.
 As noted above, although we intend to label and sell our products for research purposes only, the regulatory requirements related to marketing, selling and supporting such products could be uncertain and depend on the totality of circumstances. This uncertainty exists even if such use by our customers occurs without our consent. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected. For example, in some cases, our customers may use our RUO products in their own laboratory-developed tests (“LDTs”) or in other FDA-regulated products for clinical diagnostic use. The FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion in not enforcing the medical device regulations against LDTs and LDT manufacturers. However, on October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents that set forth the FDA’s proposed risk-based framework for regulating LDTs, which are designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. In January 2017, the FDA announced that it would not issue final guidance on the oversight of LDTs and LDT manufacturers, but would seek further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach and give Congress an opportunity to develop a legislative solution. Any restrictions on LDTs by the FDA, HHS, Congress, or state regulatory authorities may decrease the demand for our products. The adoption of new restrictions on RUOs, whether by the FDA or Congress, could adversely affect demand for our specialized reagents and instruments.
 As laboratories and manufacturers develop more complex genetic tests and diagnostic software, the FDA may increase its regulation of LDTs. Any future legislative or administrative rule making or oversight of LDTs and LDT manufacturers, if and when finalized, may impact the sales of our products and how customers use our products, and may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws. Additionally, international sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In the future, if we decide to distribute or market our diagnostic products as IVDs in Europe, such products will be subject to regulation under the European Union (“EU”) IVD Directive and/or the IVD Medical Device Regulation (IVDR) European Union (EU) 2017/746.
 In the future, to the extent we develop any clinical diagnostic assays, we may pursue payment for such products through a diverse and broad range of channels and seek coverage and reimbursement by government health insurance programs and commercial third-party payors for such products. In the United States, there is no uniform coverage for clinical laboratory tests. The extent of coverage and rate of payment for covered services or items vary from payor to payor. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement for such products can be uncertain, time-consuming and expensive, and, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status were attained for our tests, to the extent applicable, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Changes in healthcare regulatory policies could also increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our products, decrease our revenue and adversely impact sales of, and pricing of and reimbursement for, our products.


In the event that we develop clinical diagnostic assays for which third-party reimbursement becomes available, we would also become subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse and transparency laws. Among other things, these laws may impact our arrangements with customers, as well as our consulting and other arrangements with healthcare providers and others who purchase, recommend or order our clinical diagnostic products. The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for or to induce or reward the purchase, lease, order, arrangement for, or recommendation of, any item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program. In addition, the federal civil and criminal false claims laws (including the civil False Claims Act, for which claims can be brought by private citizens on behalf of the government through qui tam actions), impose liability for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. Further, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which reimbursement is available under certain federal health care programs to collect and report annually certain information on payments and other transfers of value to U.S.-licensed physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Violations of these laws can result in significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, and integrity oversight and reporting obligations.
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations, impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the transmission, security and privacy of protected health information by covered entities subject to HIPAA, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers and their respective business associates and covered subcontractors that access protected health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties and made civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 In addition, in the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws state genetic privacy laws, federal and state research laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Further, the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018.
 In addition, in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been and continue to be a number of healthcare-related legislative initiatives that have significantly affected the healthcare industry. These reform initiatives may, among other things, result in modifications to the aforementioned laws and/or the implementation of new laws affecting the healthcare industry.
 Environmental Matters
 Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) that subject us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of the regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our or others’ business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the “JOBS Act”). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual gross revenue; (ii) the date we qualify as a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (iii) the issuance, in any three-year period, by us of more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) December 31, 2026. As a result of this status, we have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements in this report that are applicable to other publicly traded entities that are not emerging growth companies and may elect to take advantage of other exemptions from reporting requirements in our future filings with the SEC. In particular, in this report, these exemptions include:
•the option to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;
 •not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended;
 •not being required to submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency,” and “say-on-golden parachutes”; and


•not being required to disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.
 As a result, we do not know if some investors will find our common stock less attractive. The result may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and the price of our common stock may become more volatile.
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, delaying the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for private companies. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies.
 Facilities
  As of December 31, 2022 we leased 135,311 square feet of office, laboratory and manufacturing space in San Diego, California under various leases that expire in 2024, 2026 and 2036.
 In January 2022, we entered into a Lease Agreement (the “OAS Lease”) with an affiliate of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. to lease two buildings (“Building 3” and “Building 4”) to be constructed in connection with One Alexandria Square in La Jolla, California. Building 3 and Building 4 are comprised of 113,094 square feet and 92,572 square feet, respectively, of office and manufacturing space and will serve as the Company’s future headquarters. Per the OAS Lease, the target commencement dates of Building 3 and Building 4 are estimated to be November 1, 2024 and November 1, 2025, respectively, with a base term of 144 months beginning on the commencement date of Building 3.
