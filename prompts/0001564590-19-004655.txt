 Overview 
 We are a pharmaceutical company with expertise in omega-3 fatty acids and lipid science focused on the commercialization and development of therapeutics to improve cardiovascular, or CV, health.
 Our lead product, Vascepa® (icosapent ethyl) capsules, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for use as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride, or TG, levels in adult patients with severe (TG ≥500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. Triglycerides are the main constituent of body fat in humans. Hypertriglyceridemia refers to a condition in which patients have high levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream. The primary targeted clinical benefit of lowering triglycerides in adult patients with severe (TG ≥500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia is to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. In January 2013, we began selling and marketing Vascepa in the United States based on the FDA-approved MARINE indication of patients with severely high (TG ≥500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels, a patient population of approximately 4 million people in the United States. 
 Our FDA-approved indication for Vascepa, known as the MARINE indication, is based primarily on the successful results from the MARINE study of Vascepa in the approved patient population. In considering this approval, the FDA also reviewed the successful results from our study of Vascepa in patients with high triglyceride levels (TG ≥200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL) who are also on statin therapy for elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C, levels which condition we refer to as mixed dyslipidemia or persistent high triglycerides. This study is known as the ANCHOR study.
 In August 2015, in addition to our FDA-approved indication, we began promoting Vascepa to healthcare professionals, or HCPs, in the United States for the lowering of triglyceride levels and other lipid and lipoprotein parameters in treatment of the patient population studied in the ANCHOR study (persistent high triglycerides after statin therapy). It is estimated that one in four adults in the United States, or more than 50 million people, have elevated (>150 mg/dL) triglyceride levels. We also educated HCPs with supportive but not conclusive early stage and Japanese cardiovascular outcomes trial research on how the unique active ingredient in Vascepa, icosapent ethyl, might reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. This HCP promotion was based on an August 2015 federal court declaration and subsequent settlement with the FDA and U.S. government that we believe permits such promotion under the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. To remain truthful and non-misleading, as part of this promotion we educated HCPs on the continued uncertainty between lowering triglycerides and cardiovascular risk reduction based on the failure of other drugs (fenofibrate and formulations of niacin) to demonstrate incremental cardiovascular benefit from adding a second lipid-altering drug on top of standard of care statin therapy, despite such drugs reducing triglyceride levels and having other favorable effects on lipid and lipoprotein parameters. We believe that, in general, HCPs prefer to review and rely on robust cardiovascular outcomes trial results before changing prescribing practices.
 Multiple primary and secondary prevention trials have shown a significant relative risk reduction, or RRR, of 25% to 35% in the risk of cardiovascular events with statin therapy, leaving significant persistent residual risk despite the achievement of target LDL-C levels. Worldwide, cardiovascular disease, or CVD, remains the number one killer of men and women. In the United States, CVD leads to one in every three deaths—one death approximately every 38 seconds—with annual treatment cost in excess of $500 billion. There is no FDA-approved therapy for lowering cardiovascular risk beyond therapies which target lowering of LDL-C levels.
 Since our inception, we have devoted substantial resources to our research and development efforts, most significantly our Vascepa cardiovascular outcomes trial, REDUCE-IT™, which we commenced in 2011 and was conducted based on a special protocol assessment, or SPA, agreement with the FDA. REDUCE-IT was a global study of 8,179 statin-treated adults with elevated cardiovascular risk. We announced topline results from the REDUCE-IT study on September 24, 2018. On November 10, 2018, we announced the more detailed, primary results from the REDUCE-IT study at the 2018 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, or AHA, and the results were concurrently published in The New England Journal of Medicine. REDUCE-IT met its primary endpoint demonstrating a 25% relative risk reduction, or RRR, to a high degree of statistical significance (p<0.001), in first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events, or MACE, in the intent-to-treat patient population with use of Vascepa 4 grams/day as compared to placebo. Patients who were enrolled in REDUCE-IT needed to have LDL-C between 41-100 mg/dL (median baseline LDL-C75 mg/dL) controlled by statin therapy and various cardiovascular risk factors including persistent elevated triglycerides, or TG, between 135-499 mg/dL (median baseline 216 mg/dL) and either established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention cohort) or be at least age 50 with diabetes mellitus and at least one other CV risk factor (primary prevention cohort). Approximately 59% of the patients had diabetes at baseline, approximately 71% of the patients had established cardiovascular disease at time of enrollment and approximately 29% were primary prevention subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease. REDUCE-IT also showed a 26% RRR in its key secondary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, heart attacks and stroke (p<0.001). 
 In September 2018, in connection with the public release of topline REDUCE-IT results, we commenced communications to healthcare professionals which were intended to ensure we meet our continuing obligation to update HCPs regarding off-label use of 
 2


Vascepa to ensure that our communications remain truthful and non-misleading. We believe this promotion is consistent with the federal court approved settlement with the FDA and U.S. government. After publication of primary results of the REDUCE-IT study in The New England Journal of Medicine and the scientific presentation of REDUCE-IT results at the 2018 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association (AHA) on November 10, 2018, we updated and expanded our communication of REDUCE-IT results to include the publication and the peer-reviewed information presented in an effort to further ensure that our communications remain truthful and non-misleading. While we believe we are now permitted under the settlement and our First Amendment rights to more broadly promote Vascepa, the FDA-approved labeling for Vascepa has not changed as we have not yet applied for FDA approval for marketing claims related to REDUCE-IT. Also, neither government nor other third-party coverage or reimbursement to pay for the off-label use of Vascepa promoted was covered under the court declaration or settlement. We plan to submit a supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, to the FDA seeking revised labeling for Vascepa based on results of the REDUCE-IT study and, upon such expanded labeling, subject to FDA approval of such label, to further expand its promotion of Vascepa in the United States.
 We sell Vascepa principally to a limited number of major wholesalers, as well as selected regional wholesalers and specialty pharmacy providers, or collectively, our Distributors or our customers, that in turn resell Vascepa to retail pharmacies for subsequent resale to patients and healthcare providers. We market Vascepa in the United States through our direct sales force. In March 2014, we entered into a co-promotion agreement in the United States with Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. under which Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. began to co-promote Vascepa in conjunction with its promotion of its primary product, a branded statin for patients with high cholesterol, which commenced in May 2014 and extended until the end of 2018. Amarin and Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. intentionally designed the co-promotion to naturally end as of December 31, 2018 and mutually agreed not to renew the agreement. Prior to the REDUCE-IT results topline announcement in September 2018, our direct sales force consisted of approximately 170 sales professionals, including sales representatives and their managers. We have recently increased the size of our sales force to approximately 440 sales professionals, including approximately 400 sales representatives, in the United States pursuant to positive REDUCE-IT results and are expanding our promotion of Vascepa. Such promotion, prior to results of the REDUCE-IT study, was based on demonstrated changes in biomarkers based on our MARINE and ANCHOR studies. Most healthcare professionals express that they prefer outcomes data to biomarker data. Because prior to results of the REDUCE-IT study we did not have outcomes data regarding the clinical effect of Vascepa and because a substantial portion of our resources were being spent on the REDUCE-IT study, prior to REDUCE-IT results our commercialization of Vascepa was somewhat limited. Subsequent to learning the positive cardiovascular outcomes results of the REDUCE-IT study, we have begun increasing our promotion of Vascepa.
 In addition to promotion of Vascepa in the United States, we have entered into strategic partnerships and license arrangements in Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and Canada to further promote, develop and commercialize Vascepa. In February 2015, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Eddingpharm (Asia) Macao Commercial Offshore Limited, or Eddingpharm, to develop and commercialize Vascepa capsules in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or the China Territory. In March 2016, we entered into an agreement with Biologix FZCo, or Biologix, to register and commercialize Vascepa in countries within the Middle East and North Africa. In September 2017, we entered into an agreement with HLS Therapeutics Inc., or HLS, to register, commercialize and distribute Vascepa in Canada. 
 In June 2018, we entered into a collaboration with Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Mochida, related to development and potential subsequent commercialization of drug products and indications based on the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Vascepa, the omega-3 acid, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid). The potential new product and indication opportunities contemplated under this agreement are currently in early stages of development. 
 We continue to assess other collaboration opportunities to maximize the value of the Vascepa franchise globally. 
 Commercialization—United States 
 We commenced the commercial launch of 1-gram size Vascepa capsules in the United States in January 2013. We commenced sales and shipments of Vascepa at that time to our network of U.S.-based wholesalers. Prior to the REDUCE-IT results topline announcement in September 2018, our direct sales force consisted of approximately 170 sales professionals, including sales representatives and their managers. We have recently increased the size of our sales force to approximately 440 sales professionals, including approximately 400 sales representatives, pursuant to positive REDUCE-IT results and are expanding our promotion of Vascepa. Commencing in May 2014, in addition to Vascepa promotion by our sales representatives, Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. began co-promoting Vascepa in conjunction with its promotion of its primary product, a branded statin for patients with high cholesterol. Amarin and Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. intentionally designed the co-promotion to naturally end as of December 31, 2018 and mutually agreed not to renew the agreement. We also employ various medical affairs and marketing personnel to support our commercialization of Vascepa. We expanded certain medical education and market awareness initiatives following the reporting of positive REDUCE-IT results in 2018. We intend to further expand promotion of Vascepa following label expansion of Vascepa, subject to FDA approval of such expanded label.

In October 2016, in addition to the original 1-gram capsule size for Vascepa, we introduced a smaller 0.5-gram capsule size, the first and only 0.5-gram prescription omega-3 alternative available on the market, for the subset of patients who prefer a smaller capsule. The FDA-approved dosing for Vascepa continues to be 4 grams per day, and, as expected, the majority of new and existing patients taking Vascepa continue to be prescribed the 1-gram size Vascepa capsule. 
 From May 2014 until December 2018, under our co-promotion agreement with Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., both parties agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to promote, detail and optimize sales of Vascepa in the United States and agreed to specific performance requirements detailed in the related agreement. The performance requirements included a negotiated minimum number of sales details to be delivered by each party in the first and second position, the use of a negotiated number of minimum sales representatives from each party, and the achievement of minimum levels of Vascepa revenue in 2015 and beyond. First position referred to when a sales representative’s primary purpose in detailing is related to Vascepa, while second position referred to when a sales representative’s primary purpose in detailing is to promote another product, but they also devoted time in the same sales call to promote Vascepa. Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. also agreed to bear the costs incurred for its sales force associated with the commercialization of Vascepa and to pay for certain incremental costs associated with the use of its sales force, such as sample costs and costs for promotional and marketing materials. We recognized all revenue from sales of Vascepa. In exchange for Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc.’s co-promotional services, Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. was entitled to a quarterly co-promotion fee based on a percentage of aggregate Vascepa gross margin that varied during the term. The percentage of aggregate Vascepa gross margin earned by Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. was, as amended, approximately eighteen percent (18%) in 2017, partially offset by certain other refinements. During 2018, which was the last year of the agreement, as amended, we incurred expense for both the annual co-promotion fee, which in 2018 was calculated as eighteen-and-a-half percent (18.5%) of Vascepa gross margin, plus accrual for co-promotion tail payments which are calculated as a percentage of the 2018 co-promotion fee. Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. is eligible to receive $17.8 million in co-promotion tail payments, the present value of which of $16.6 million was fully accrued as of December 31, 2018. The accrued tail payments will be paid over three years with declining amounts each year beginning with $7.3 million to be paid in 2019. 
 Based on monthly compilations of data provided by a third party, Symphony Health, the estimated number of normalized total Vascepa prescriptions for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 539,000 compared to 458,000, 430,000, 391,000, and 404,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2018, June 30, 2018, March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. According to data from another third party, IQVIA, the estimated number of normalized total Vascepa prescriptions for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 538,000 compared to 457,000, 430,000, 392,000, and 409,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2018, June 30, 2018, March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. Normalized total prescriptions represent the estimated total number of Vascepa prescriptions dispensed to patients, calculated on a normalized basis (i.e., one month’s supply, or total capsules dispensed multiplied by the number of grams per capsule divided by 120 grams). Inventory levels at wholesalers tend to fluctuate based on seasonal factors, prescription trends and other factors. 
 The data reported above is based on information made available to us from third-party resources and may be subject to adjustment and may overstate or understate actual prescriptions. Timing of shipments to wholesalers, as used for revenue recognition purposes, and timing of prescriptions as estimated by these third parties may differ from period to period. Although we believe this data is prepared on a period-to-period basis in a manner that is generally consistent and that such results can be generally indicative of current prescription trends, the data is based on estimates and should not be relied upon as definitive. While we expect to be able to grow Vascepa revenues over time, no guidance should be inferred from the operating metrics described above. We also anticipate that such sales growth will be inconsistent from period to period. We believe that investors should view the above-referenced operating metrics with caution, as data for this limited period may not be representative of a trend consistent with the results presented or otherwise predictive of future results. Seasonal fluctuations in pharmaceutical sales, for example, may affect future prescription trends of Vascepa, as could changes in prescriber sentiment, quarterly changes in Distributor purchases, and other factors. We believe investors should consider our results over several quarters, or longer, before making an assessment about potential future performance. 
 The commercialization of pharmaceutical products is a complex undertaking, and our ability to effectively and profitably commercialize Vascepa will depend in part on our ability to generate market demand for Vascepa through education, marketing and sales activities, our ability to achieve market acceptance of Vascepa, our ability to generate product revenue and our ability to receive adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Commercialization and Development of Vascepa.” 
 In August 2015, we and our co-promotion partner began communicating promotional information beyond MARINE clinical trial data to targeted healthcare professionals. Such qualified communications are being made pursuant to the August 2015 federal district court declaration and related March 2016 settlement allowing truthful and non-misleading promotion of the FDA-reviewed and agreed effects of Vascepa demonstrated in the ANCHOR clinical trial and presentation of the current state of scientific research related to the potential of Vascepa to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease including through use of peer-reviewed scientific publications of available data.

In September 2018, in connection with the public release of topline REDUCE-IT results, we commenced communications to healthcare professionals, or HCPs, which were intended to ensure we meet our continuing obligation to update HCPs regarding off-label use of Vascepa to ensure that our communications remain truthful and non-misleading. We believe this promotion is consistent with the federal court approved settlement with the FDA and U.S. government. After publication of primary results of the REDUCE-IT study in The New England Journal of Medicine and the scientific presentation of REDUCE-IT results at the 2018 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association (AHA) on November 10, 2018, we updated and expanded our communication of REDUCE-IT results to include the publication and the peer-reviewed information presented in an effort to further ensure that our communications remain truthful and non-misleading. While we believe we are now permitted under the settlement and our First Amendment rights to more broadly promote Vascepa, the FDA-approved labeling for Vascepa has not changed as we have not yet applied for FDA approval for marketing claims related to REDUCE-IT. Also, neither government nor other third-party coverage or reimbursement to pay for the off-label use of Vascepa promoted was covered under the court declaration or settlement.
 Commercialization—Outside the United States 
 In February 2015, we announced an exclusive agreement with Eddingpharm to develop and commercialize Vascepa capsules in what we refer to as the China Territory, consisting of the territories of Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, for uses that are currently commercialized and under development by us in the United States based on the MARINE, ANCHOR and REDUCE-IT clinical trials of Vascepa. 
 Under the agreement, Eddingpharm is responsible for development and commercialization activities in the China Territory and associated expenses. We will provide development assistance and be responsible for supplying the product. Terms of the agreement include up-front and milestone payments to us of up to $169.0 million, including a non-refundable $15.0 million up-front payment received at closing and a non-refundable milestone payment of $1.0 million received upon successful submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, with respect to the MARINE indication for Vascepa to the Chinese regulatory authority in March 2016. In March 2017, the CTA was approved by the Chinese regulatory authority and, in December 2017, Eddingpharm commenced a pivotal clinical trial aimed to support the regulatory approval of the first indication of Vascepa in a patient population with severe hypertriglyceridemia in Mainland China. We are also entitled to receive future regulatory and sales-based milestone payments of up to an additional $153.0 million. The regulatory milestone events relate to the submission and approval of certain applications to the applicable regulatory authority, such as a clinical trial application, clinical trial exemption, or import drug license application. The amounts to be received upon achievement of the regulatory milestone events relate to the submission and approval for three indications, and range from $2.0 million to $15.0 million for a total of $33.0 million. The sales-based milestone events occur when annual aggregate net sales of Vascepa in the territory equals or exceeds certain specified thresholds, and range from $5.0 million to $50.0 million for a total of $120.0 million. Eddingpharm will also pay us tiered double-digit percentage royalties on net sales of Vascepa in the China Territory escalating to the high teens. We will supply finished product to Eddingpharm under negotiated terms. 
 In March 2016, we entered into an agreement with Biologix FZCo, or Biologix, to register and commercialize Vascepa in several Middle Eastern and North African countries. Under the terms of the distribution agreement, we granted to Biologix a non-exclusive license to use our trademarks in connection with the importation, distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of Vascepa in the Middle East and North Africa territory. Upon closing of the agreement, we received a non-refundable up-front payment, which will be recognized as revenue over 10 years commencing upon first marketing approval of Vascepa in the territory. We receive all payments based on total product sales and pay Biologix a service fee in exchange for its services, whereby the service fee represents a percentage of gross selling price which is subject to a minimum floor price. In March 2018 and July 2018, we received approval for Vascepa as a prescription medication for use in Lebanon and United Arab Emirates, respectively, as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia.
 In September 2017, we entered into an agreement with HLS to register, commercialize and distribute Vascepa in Canada. Under the agreement, HLS will be responsible for regulatory and commercialization activities and associated costs. We will be responsible for providing assistance towards local filings, supplying finished product under negotiated supply terms, maintaining intellectual property, and continuing the development and funding of REDUCE-IT related activities. Terms of the agreement include up-front and milestone payments to us of up to $65.0 million. These payments include a non-refundable $5.0 million up-front payment received in two equal installments, the first of which was received at closing with the second received upon the six-month anniversary of the closing, as well as a non-refundable milestone payment of $2.5 million received upon achievement of the REDUCE-IT trial primary endpoint. In addition to the non-refundable, up-front payment, we are entitled to receive certain regulatory and sales-based milestone payments of up to an additional $57.5 million, the timing and achievability of which cannot be determined at this time, as well as tiered double-digit royalties on net sales of Vascepa in Canada.  
 We continue to assess other partnership opportunities for licensing Vascepa to partners outside of the United States.

Research and Development 
 Since our inception, we have devoted substantial resources to the research and development of Vascepa (icosapent ethyl) capsules. Vascepa is a single-molecule prescription product consisting of the omega-3 acid commonly known as EPA in ethyl-ester form. Vascepa is derived from fish through a stringent and complex FDA-regulated manufacturing process designed to effectively eliminate impurities and isolate and protect the single molecule active ingredient from degradation. Vascepa has been designated a new chemical entity by the FDA. Vascepa is known in scientific literature as AMR101.  
 Our most important clinical trials of Vascepa are summarized here and discussed in further detail below:
  
• | The MARINE trial, a Phase 3, multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, 12-week study in patients with very high (≥500 mg/dL) triglycerides (TG) with the primary endpoint being the lowering of TG levels;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ANCHOR trial, a Phase 3 multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, 12-week pivotal study in patients with high (≥200 and <500 mg/dL) TGs who were also receiving optimized statin therapy with the primary endpoint being the lowering of TG levels; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The REDUCE-IT trial, a Phase 3 global study of 8,179 statin-treated adults with elevated cardiovascular risk with a primary endpoint being the first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events, or MACE, in the intent-to-treat patient population, patients with LDL-C between 41-100 mg/dL (median baseline LDL-C75 mg/dL) controlled by statin therapy and various cardiovascular risk factors including persistent elevated TG between 135-499 mg/dL and either established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention cohort) or age 50 or more with diabetes mellitus and at least one other CV risk factor (primary prevention cohort).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The REDUCE-IT cardiovascular outcomes study of Vascepa has been the centerpiece of our research and development efforts. Prior research on Vascepa, such as the MARINE and ANCHOR trials, had been focused on the effects of the drug on biomarkers associated with increased risk of pancreatitis and increased risk of cardiovascular events. Other prior and ongoing research and development efforts include the study of potential mechanisms of action of Vascepa.
 In June 2018, we entered into a multi-faceted collaboration with Mochida related to the development and commercialization of drug products and indications based on the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Vascepa, the omega-3 acid, EPA. Among other terms in the agreement, we obtained an exclusive license to certain Mochida intellectual property to advance our interests in the United States and certain other territories and the parties will collaborate to research and develop new products and indications based on EPA for our commercialization in the United States and certain other territories. The potential new product and indication opportunities contemplated under this agreement are currently in early stages of development. 
 Additional research and development opportunities beyond REDUCE-IT will be assessed more fully after giving priority to securing regulatory approval for Vascepa based on the REDUCE-IT results. 
 Commercial and Clinical Supply 
 We manage the manufacturing and supply of Vascepa internally and have done so since we began clinical development of Vascepa prior to the drug’s marketing approval by the FDA in 2012. We rely on contract manufacturers in each step of our commercial and clinical product supply chain. These steps include active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, manufacturing, encapsulation of the API, product packaging and supply-related logistics. Our approach to product supply procurement is designed to mitigate risk of supply interruption and maintain an environment of cost competition through diversification of contract manufacturers at each stage of the supply chain and lack of reliance on any single supplier. We have multiple FDA-approved international API suppliers, encapsulators and packagers to support the Vascepa commercial franchise. The amount of supply we seek to purchase in future periods will depend on the level of growth of Vascepa revenues and minimum purchase commitments with certain suppliers. While our current supply chain is scalable, we continue efforts to expand, diversify and further enhance it. 
Financial Position 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents of $249.2 million as of December 31, 2018 will be sufficient to fund our projected operations for at least twelve months and through the likely Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for approval of a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) by the FDA based on REDUCE-IT study results. Depending on the level of cash generated from operations, and depending in part on the timing and results of the FDA review of the sNDA and rate of prescription growth for Vascepa, additional capital may be required to support planned expansion of Vascepa promotion and potential Vascepa promotion beyond which we are currently executing. If additional capital is required and we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may be forced to delay, limit or eliminate certain promotional activities. We anticipate that quarterly net cash outflows in future periods will be variable.

Lipid Disorders and Cardiovascular Disease 
 Heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular events represent the leading cause of death and disability among men and women in western societies. According to the Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics—2018 Update from the American Heart Association, more than 1 out of every 3 adults in the United States (approximately 92 million) currently lives with one or more types of cardiovascular disease; an estimated 1 million new or recurrent coronary events and 795,000 new or recurrent strokes occur each year; an estimated 29 million adults ≥20 years of age have high total serum cholesterol levels (≥240 mg/dL), and an estimated 71 million adults ≥20 years of age have borderline high or high low-density lipoprotein (“bad”) cholesterol, or LDL-C, levels (≥130 mg/dL). 
 In addition to cholesterol, lipoproteins such as LDL also carry fats in the form of triglycerides. Hypertriglyceridemia refers to a condition in which patients have high levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream and has been reported to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Triglyceride levels provide important information as a marker associated with the risk for heart disease and stroke. 
 Guidelines for the management of very high triglyceride levels (≥500 mg/dL) suggest that reducing triglyceride levels is the primary treatment goal in these patients to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis. Treating LDL-C remains an important secondary goal. Other important parameters to consider in patients with very high triglycerides include levels of apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-HDL-C, and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C). The effect of Vascepa on the risk for pancreatitis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia has not been determined. 
 It is estimated that over 25 million adults in the United States have elevated triglyceride levels ≥200 mg/dL and that more than 50 million adults in the United States have elevated triglyceride levels ≥150 mg/dL. Additionally, approximately 2 to 3 million adults in the United States have very high triglyceride levels (≥500 mg/dL). Since 1976, mean triglyceride levels have increased, in concert with the growing epidemic of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In contrast, mean LDL-C levels have decreased. 
 Mixed dyslipidemia refers to a condition in which patients have a combination of two or more lipid abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, and/or elevated LDL-C. Both hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia are components of a range of lipid disorders collectively referred to as dyslipidemia. Dyslipidemia has been linked to atherosclerosis, commonly referred to as hardening of the arteries. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Hypertriglyceridema (HTG) is a prevalent lipid disorder in approximately 25% of the U.S. adult population. Both epidemiological and genetic data have shown associations between HTG and coronary heart disease. Many of those patients are taking statin therapy directed at lowering the risk of CVD by lowering their LDL-C levels, primarily. Recently, real world administrative database analyses have reported an increased CVD risk as well as direct healthcare costs associated with HTG despite statin therapy and controlled LDL-C compared to those with TG<150 mg/dL. It is estimated that approximately 6% or less of U.S. adults with triglyceride levels ≥200 mg/dL are currently receiving prescription medication for lowering triglycerides, many of whom are already on statin therapy. 
 Vascepa is not FDA-approved to lower TG levels in statin-treated patients with mixed dyslipidemia and persistent high (≥200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL) TG levels due to uncertainty raised by FDA in 2013 regarding the benefit, if any, of drug-induced changes in lipid/lipoprotein parameters beyond statin-lowered LDL-C on cardiovascular risk among statin-treated patients with residually high TG. This lack of approval by FDA based on the pharmaceutical target of lowering TG levels as a surrogate for lowering the risk of CVD was due primarily to the failure of cardiovascular outcomes trials of lipid altering drugs in the fenofibrate and niacin drug classes. In CV outcomes trials, therapies that reduce TG levels and had other favorable effects on classically studied lipid and lipoprotein parameters, such as extended-release niacin and fibrates, did not met their primary CV endpoints to reduce risk when taken with contemporary medical therapy, including statins. Specifically, cardiovascular outcomes trials, ACCORD Lipid, AIM-HIGH, and HPS2-THRIVE, while not designed to test the effect of lowering TG levels in patients with high TG levels after statin therapy, each failed to demonstrate incremental cardiovascular benefit of adding a second lipid-altering drug (fenofibrate or formulations of niacin), despite raising HDL-C and reducing TG levels, among statin-treated patients with well-controlled LDL-C. As a result, in 2015, the FDA updated both the Trilipix® (a fenofibrate) and extended-release niacin product labeling and removed combination use with statin therapy in mixed dyslipidemia patients as an indication due to a failed outcomes trial. No head-to head, randomized, well-controlled studies have been conducted to compare the effects of Vascepa with other FDA-approved TG-lowering therapies.
 Additionally, recent CV outcomes trials and meta-analyses with low dose omega-3 fatty acid mixtures containing DHA have not shown substantial benefit in patients receiving contemporary medical therapy, including statins. Due to these failed low dose omega-3 CV outcomes trials, the European regulatory authorities have concluded that omega-3 fatty acid medicines (specifically Lovaza®/Omacor®) at a dose of 1-gram per day are not effective in preventing further events for patients who have had a heart attack.

It is against that backdrop of failed studies demonstrating the limitations of other add-on drugs to statin drug therapies that we conducted the REDUCE-IT cardiovascular outcomes trial.
 Potential Benefits and Market Opportunity for Vascepa 
 Vascepa is 1-gram of icosapent ethyl, or ethyl-EPA, and contains no DHA. We believe that the removal of DHA mitigates against the LDL-C raising effect observed in omega-3 compositions that include DHA. Based on the results of the MARINE trial, Vascepa was the first omega-3 based product to demonstrate statistically significant triglyceride reduction without a statistically significant increase in LDL-C in this very high triglyceride population. 
 We believe that the results of the REDUCE-IT, ANCHOR and MARINE clinical trials of Vascepa and Vascepa’s EPA only/DHA-free composition position Vascepa to achieve a global “best-in-class” prescription therapy in studied patient populations. Potential mechanisms of action at work in the reduction of cardiovascular events seen in REDUCE-IT as discussed in The New England Journal of Medicine publication of REDUCE-IT primary results include TG reduction, anti-thrombotic effects, antiplatelet or anticoagulant effects, membrane-stabilizing effects, effects on stabilization and/or regression of coronary plaque and inflammation reduction. Mechanisms responsible for the benefit shown in REDUCE-IT were not studied in REDUCE-IT as that was not the purpose of an outcomes study. More study is needed to determine to what extent, if any, each of these effects or others may be responsible for the CV risk reduction benefit demonstrated in REDUCE-IT.
Clinical Trials 
 The MARINE Trial (basis for currently FDA-approved label for Vascepa) 
 The MARINE trial, the largest study ever conducted with the omega-3 fatty acid ethyl EPA in treating patients with very high triglycerides (≥500 mg/dL), was a Phase 3, multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, 12-week study. Patients were randomized into three treatment arms for treatment with Vascepa 4 gram/day, 2 gram/day or placebo. Patient enrollment in this trial began in December 2009, and enrollment and randomization was completed in August 2010 at 229 patients. The primary endpoint in the trial was the percentage change in triglyceride level from baseline compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment. The MARINE study primary endpoint was required to meet a stringent level of statistical significance of 1% (p < 0.01) in our special protocol assessment, or SPA, agreement with the FDA. 
 In November 2010, we reported topline data for the MARINE trial. In the trial, Vascepa met its primary endpoint at doses of 4 grams and 2 grams per day with median placebo-adjusted reductions in triglyceride levels of 33% (p < 0.0001) compared to placebo for 4 grams and 20% (p = 0.0051) compared to placebo for 2 grams. The median baseline triglyceride levels were 703 mg/dL, 680 mg/dL and 657 mg/dL for the patient groups treated with placebo, 4 grams of Vascepa and 2 grams of Vascepa, respectively. 
 In a pre-specified secondary analysis in the subgroup of patients with baseline triglyceride > 750 mg/dL, representing 39% of all patients, the effect of Vascepa in reducing triglyceride levels compared to placebo was 45% for 4 grams and 33% for 2 grams, both statistically significant (p = 0.0001 for 4 grams and p= 0.0016 for 2 grams, respectively). The median baseline triglyceride levels in this subgroup were 1052 mg/dL, 902 mg/dL and 948 mg/dL for placebo, 4-gram and 2-gram groups, respectively. Twenty-five percent of patients in this trial were also on background statin therapy. These patients had greater median reduction in triglyceride levels, which was also statistically significant. 
 Importantly, the significant reduction in triglycerides was not associated with a statistically significant increase in median LDL-C compared to placebo at either dose (-2.3% for the 4-gram group and +5.2% for the 2-gram group [both p=NS]). In addition, there was a statistically significant decrease in median non-HDL-C (total cholesterol less so-called “good cholesterol”) compared to placebo with both of the Vascepa-treated groups (-18% for the 4-gram group [p < 0.001] and -8% for the 2-gram group [p < 0.05]). 
 The MARINE trial results also included statistically significant reductions compared to placebo in several important lipid and inflammatory biomarkers, including apo B (apolipoprotein B) (8.5%), Lp-PLA2 (lipoprotein-phospholipase A2) (13.6%), VLDL-C (very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) (28.6%), Total Cholesterol (16.3%), and hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) (36.0%) at the 4-gram dose. For these achieved endpoints, p-values were <0.01 for most and <0.05 for all. Apo B (apolipoprotein B) is believed to be a sensitive biomarker of cardiovascular risk and may be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than LDL-C. Lp-PLA2 is an enzyme found in blood and atherosclerotic plaque; high levels have been implicated in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. In a post-hoc analysis of MARINE study data, Vascepa 4 g/day and 2 g/day statistically significantly reduced ApoC-III levels by 25.1% (p < 0.0001) and 14.3% (p=0.0154) versus placebo, respectively. In the MARINE trial, patients treated with 4 grams per day of Vascepa experienced a significant reduction in median placebo-adjusted lipoprotein particle concentrations of total LDL and small LDL. When looking at lipoprotein particle concentrations and sizes as measured with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Vascepa 4 grams per day, compared with placebo, significantly reduced median total LDL particle count by 16.3% (p=0.0006), which is an important factor in atherogenesis. LDL particle count and apo B are important risk markers for the prediction of cardiovascular events. Small LDL particle count, which is a common risk factor for cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes,

was reduced by 25.6% (p<0.0001) compared with placebo. Vascepa 2 grams per day, compared with placebo, significantly reduced median small LDL particle count by 12.8% (p <0.05) and reduced median total LDL particle count by 1.1% (NS). LDL particle size did not change significantly for the 2 or 4 gram per day doses. 
 Vascepa was well tolerated in the MARINE trial, with a safety profile comparable to placebo and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events observed. No patient discontinued treatment of Vascepa during this study due to Vascepa-related adverse events. No significant changes in fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, vital signs, electrocardiograms, or liver or kidney function were observed with either Vascepa dose. 
 Patients enrolled in the MARINE trial were given the option to be treated with Vascepa for a period of up to 40 weeks after their last dose in the double-blind portion of the trial. Once participants completed the randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled 12-week MARINE registration trial, patients in all three randomized groups (4 grams, 2 grams and placebo) were offered the opportunity to participate in the open label extension, or OLE, phase. Patients in the OLE phase received 4 grams per day of Vascepa for a period of up to an additional 40 weeks. As is typical of such extension phases, the OLE phase was not a controlled trial, as differentiated from the randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled 12-week MARINE registration trial. In the OLE phase, participants were not randomized at entry, Vascepa administration was open-label (and thus not blinded), and no placebo group was maintained. Also, once patients entered in the OLE phase, investigators were free to add or modify other lipid-altering nutritional, lifestyle and drug treatment regimens. Given the lack of randomization, the open-label design, the addition of various other lipid-altering drugs and changes to doses of existing lipid-altering drugs, as well as the lack of placebo control, neither we nor our independent advisors were able to draw efficacy conclusions from the data. However, we have concluded that the MARINE OLE phase revealed no new safety signals after an additional 40 weeks of exposure to Vascepa, whether used alone or in combination with other lipid-altering regimens. 
 The ANCHOR Trial (promoted in the United States under court declaration) 
 The ANCHOR trial was a multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, 12-week pivotal study in patients with high triglycerides (≥200 and <500 mg/dL) who were also receiving optimized statin therapy. Patients were randomized into three arms for treatment with Vascepa 4 gram/day, 2 gram/day or placebo. Patient enrollment in this trial began in January 2010, and enrollment and randomization was completed in February 2011 at 702 patients. The primary endpoint in the trial was the percentage change in triglyceride level from baseline compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment. 
 In April 2011, we reported topline results from the ANCHOR trial. The ANCHOR trial met its primary endpoint at doses of 4 grams and 2 grams per day with median placebo-adjusted reductions in triglyceride levels of 21.5% (p<0.0001 value) for 4 grams and 10.1% (p=0.0005) for 2 grams. The median baseline triglyceride levels were 259 mg/dL, 265 mg/dL and 254 mg/dL for the patient groups treated with placebo, 4 grams and 2 grams of Vascepa per day, respectively. The analysis of subgroups by baseline triglyceride tertiles showed that higher baseline triglycerides resulted in greater triglyceride reductions. 
 One of the trial’s secondary endpoints was to demonstrate a lack of elevation in LDL-C, the primary target of cholesterol lowering therapy. The trial’s non-inferiority criterion for LDL-C was met at both Vascepa doses. The upper confidence boundaries for both doses were below the pre-specified +6% LDL-C threshold limit. At the 4-gram dose the upper confidence boundary was below zero (-1.7%) and at the 2-gram dose the upper confidence boundary was close to zero (0.5%). For the 4 grams per day group, LDL-C decreased significantly by 6.2% from baseline versus placebo, demonstrating superiority over placebo (p=0.0067). For the 2-gram group, LDL-C decreased by 3.6% from baseline versus placebo (p=0.0867), which is not a statistically significant decrease. 
 Other secondary efficacy endpoints included the median placebo-adjusted percent change in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2). The 4-gram dose was associated with statistically significant reductions in non-HDL-C (13.6%, p<0.0001), apo B (9.3%, p<0.0001), Lp-PLA2 (19%, p<0.0001) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (22%, p<0.001), at week 12 compared to placebo. One published analysis showed that the Vascepa 4-gram daily dose in the ANCHOR study also significantly decreased levels of the inflammatory marker oxidized low-density lipoprotein relative to placebo by 13% (p < 0.0001). In a separate, post-hoc analysis of study data, Vascepa 4 g/day statistically significantly reduced ApoC-III levels by 25.1% in MARINE (p < 0.0001) and by 19.2% in ANCHOR (p < 0.0001) versus placebo. 
 Vascepa was well tolerated in the ANCHOR trial with a safety profile comparable to placebo and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events observed. No significant changes in fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, vital signs, electrocardiograms, or liver or kidney function were observed with either Vascepa dose. The safety results from the ANCHOR trial are included in the current FDA-approved label for Vascepa. 
 In April 2015, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA in response to our supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, that sought approval of Vascepa for use in patients with mixed dyslipidemia, based on the successful ANCHOR study. The CRL followed an October 2013 rescission by the FDA of a SPA agreement and three failed attempts by us to appeal that rescission at FDA. The FDA has acknowledged the success of the ANCHOR study, which met all primary and secondary endpoints.

However, FDA determined that there were insufficient data to conclude that drug-induced changes in serum triglycerides could be recognized by the FDA as a valid surrogate for reducing cardiovascular risk in the ANCHOR population for the purpose of regulatory approval of a drug targeted at a triglyceride-lowering indication in this population. The FDA has acknowledged that the standard of proof required by the FDA for approval of a new drug indication is higher than that generally used to inform patient treatment guidelines and that used by physicians in clinical practice. The FDA did not determine that the drug-induced effects of Vascepa, which go beyond triglyceride-lowering, would not actually reduce cardiovascular risk in this population and the FDA has encouraged us to complete the REDUCE-IT outcomes study. Based on our communications with the FDA, it has been our expectation that submission of final positive results from the REDUCE-IT outcomes study is required for the FDA to consider label expansion for Vascepa. 
 In May 2015, we and a group of independent physicians filed a lawsuit in federal court to permit us to promote to healthcare professionals the use of Vascepa in patients with mixed dyslipidemia so long as the promotion is truthful and non-misleading. This use reflects recognized medical practice but is not covered by current FDA-approved labeling for the drug. Historically, FDA has considered promotion of drug uses not covered by FDA-approved labeling to be illegal off-label promotion, even if such promotion is truthful and non-misleading. In August 2015, we were granted preliminary relief in the form of a declaratory judgment in this lawsuit. The court declaration permits us to promote to healthcare professionals the FDA-reviewed and agreed effects of Vascepa demonstrated in the ANCHOR clinical trial and presentation of the current state of scientific research related to the potential of Vascepa to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease including through use of peer-reviewed scientific publications of available data. In August 2015, we began to communicate promotional information beyond the MARINE indication to healthcare professionals in the United States as permitted by this court declaration and in March 2016, the parties obtained court approval of negotiated settlement terms under which the FDA and the U.S. government agreed to be bound by the court’s conclusions from the August 2015 declaration that we may engage in truthful and non-misleading speech promoting the off-label use of Vascepa and that certain statements and disclosures that we proposed to make to healthcare professionals were truthful and non-misleading. While we believe we are now permitted under applicable law to more broadly promote Vascepa, the FDA-approved labeling for Vascepa did not change as a result of this litigation and settlement, and neither government nor other third-party coverage or reimbursement to pay for the off-label use of Vascepa promoted under the court declaration was required. 
 The REDUCE-IT Study (the completed cardiovascular outcomes study) 
 The REDUCE-IT study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of Vascepa in reducing major cardiovascular events in an at-risk patient population also receiving statin therapy. REDUCE-IT was a multinational, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the effectiveness of Vascepa, as an add-on to statin therapy, in reducing first major cardiovascular events in an at-risk patient population compared to statin therapy alone. The control arm of the study was comprised of patients on optimized statin therapy plus placebo. The active arm of the study was comprised of patients on optimized statin therapy plus Vascepa. All subjects enrolled in the study had elevated triglyceride levels and either established coronary heart disease or risk factors for coronary heart disease.
 In August 2011, we reached agreement with the FDA on a SPA for the design of the REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with EPA—Intervention Trial) cardiovascular outcomes study. A SPA is an evaluation by the FDA of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement that the Phase 3 trial protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval. The FDA agreed that, based on the information we submitted to the agency, the design and planned analysis of the REDUCE-IT study adequately addressed the objectives necessary to support a regulatory submission. A SPA is generally binding upon the FDA unless a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy of the drug is identified after the testing begins. 
 It is believed that the effects of EPA are not due to a single mode of action, such as triglyceride lowering, but rather to multiple mechanisms working together. Studies in the scientific literature explore potentially beneficial effects of EPA on multiple atherosclerosis processes, including endothelial function, oxidative stress, foam cell formation, inflammation/cytokines, plaque formation/progression, platelet aggregation, thrombus formation, and plaque rupture. With respect to triglyceride levels, our scientific rationale for the REDUCE-IT study was supported by (i) epidemiological data that suggests elevated triglyceride levels correlate with increased cardiovascular disease risk, (ii) genetic data that suggests triglyceride and/or triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (as well as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol), known as bad cholesterol) are independently in the causal pathway for cardiovascular disease and (iii) clinical data that suggest substantial triglyceride reduction in patients with elevated baseline triglyceride levels correlates with reduced cardiovascular risk. The REDUCE-IT study was designed to determine the clinical benefit, if any, of stable EPA therapy in statin-treated patients with elevated triglyceride levels.
 In September 2011, we engaged a clinical research organization, or CRO, and began initial trial and clinical site preparation for REDUCE-IT. In December 2011, we announced that the first patient was dosed in the study. In 2016, we completed patient enrollment and randomization of 8,179 individual patients into the REDUCE-IT study. Amarin personnel remained blinded to the efficacy and safety data from the REDUCE-IT study until after the study was completed and the database was locked in 2018.

On November 10, 2018, we announced primary results from our REDUCE-IT study as late-breaking clinical results at the 2018 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association and the results were concurrently published in The New England Journal of Medicine. REDUCE-IT met its primary endpoint demonstrating a 25% relative risk reduction, or RRR, to a high degree of statistical significance (p<0.001), in first occurrence of major adverse CV events, or MACE, in the intent-to-treat patient population with use of Vascepa 4 grams/day as compared to placebo. Patients qualified to enroll in REDUCE-IT had LDL-C between 41-100 mg/dL (median baseline LDL-C75 mg/dL) controlled by statin therapy and various cardiovascular risk factors including persistent elevated triglycerides, or TG, between 135-499 mg/dL (median baseline 216 mg/dL) and either established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention cohort) or age 50 or more with diabetes mellitus and at least one other CV risk factor (primary prevention cohort). Approximately 59% of the patients had diabetes at baseline, approximately 71% of the patients had established cardiovascular disease at time of enrollment and approximately 29% were primary prevention subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease. REDUCE-IT also showed a 26% RRR in its key secondary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, heart attacks and stroke (p<0.001). We commenced the REDUCE-IT trial in 2011 and have expended more than $300 million to fund its completion.
Number needed to treat, or NNT, was 21 for the first occurrence of MACE in the 5-point primary composite endpoint. The NNT is a statistical concept intended to provide a measurement of the impact of a medicine or therapy by estimating the number of patients that need to be treated in order to have an impact on one person.
 An additional seven secondary endpoints were achieved below the key secondary endpoint, in order of sequential statistical testing within the prespecified hierarchy:
  
• | Cardiovascular death or nonfatal heart attack: 25% RRR (p<0.001)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fatal or nonfatal heart attack: 31% RRR (p<0.001)
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Urgent or emergent revascularization: 35% RRR (p<0.001)
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Cardiovascular death: 20% RRR (p=0.03)
--+---------------------------------------


• | Hospitalization for unstable angina: 32% RRR (p=0.002)
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | Fatal or nonfatal stroke: 28% RRR (p=0.01)
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Total mortality, nonfatal heart attack or nonfatal stroke: 23% RRR (p<0.001)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The next prespecified secondary endpoint in the hierarchy was the only such endpoint that did not achieve statistical significance although it trended positively:
  
• | Total mortality, which includes mortality from non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular events: 13% RRR (p=0.09)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Positive REDUCE-IT results were consistent across various patient subgroups, including female/male, diabetic/non-diabetic and secondary/primary prevention.
 Overall adverse event rates in REDUCE-IT were similar across treatment groups and Vascepa was well tolerated with a safety profile generally consistent with clinical experience associated with omega-3 fatty acids and current FDA-approved labeling of such products. The safety results from REDUCE-IT are reviewed in The New England Journal of Medicine publication of REDUCE-IT results. 
 In the REDUCE-IT trial, cardiovascular benefits appeared not to be influenced significantly by TG levels at baseline (above or below 150 mg/dL baseline range) or as achieved at one year, potentially suggesting mechanisms at work with use of Vascepa that are independent of baseline TG levels or therapy-driven reduction in TG levels. Determining the mechanisms responsible for the benefit shown in REDUCE-IT was not the focus of REDUCE-IT. As summarized from the primary results of REDUCE-IT in The New England Journal of Medicine, potential Vascepa mechanisms of action at work in REDUCE-IT may include TG reduction, anti-thrombotic effects, antiplatelet or anticoagulant effects, membrane-stabilizing effects, effects on stabilization and/or regression of coronary plaque and inflammation reduction, each as supported by earlier stage mechanistic studies. 
 In addition, in the REDUCE-IT trial, the median change in LDL cholesterol levels from baseline was higher in the placebo group versus the Vascepa group (difference of 5.0 mg/dL; p < 0.001). However, a post hoc analysis of REDUCE-IT data, as published in The New England Journal of Medicine, showed no material difference in each of the primary and key secondary cardiovascular risk composite endpoint event rates for placebo patients that experienced an increase in LDL-C at one year versus those with no change or a decrease, and also suggested a similar relative risk reduction regardless of whether there was an increase in LDL cholesterol level among the patients in the placebo group. Moreover, as the authors of the paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine noted, the relatively small differences in LDL-C levels between the groups would not be likely to explain the 25% lower

MACE risk observed with Vascepa and the Japan open-label EPA Lipid Intervention Study, or JELIS, an over 18,000 patient cardiovascular outcomes study in Japan of a highly-pure EPA product similar to Vascepa, previously demonstrated a 19% risk reduction without a mineral oil placebo.
 Based on the positive REDUCE-IT results, we have begun promoting REDUCE-IT results to healthcare professionals in the United States based on what we believe is our continuing obligation under our First Amendment settlement to ensure that our promotion of Vascepa remains truthful and non-misleading. 
 We anticipate continuing to publish additional details of the REDUCE-IT study to address scientific interest beyond the primary results of this study derived from the over 35,000 patient years of study accumulated. 
 Regulatory Pathway for REDUCE-IT Data
 We intend to submit an sNDA to the FDA before the end of March 2019 seeking approval to expand the label for Vascepa based on the effects of Vascepa demonstrated in the REDUCE-IT study. The FDA’s determination of standard or priority review will be made when the sNDA is submitted. At this time, we are planning for a standard review with a PDUFA date which is approximately 10-months after the date of the sNDA submission.
 Observed Efficacy of Ethyl-EPA 
 In Japan, ethyl-EPA is marketed under the product name of Epadel by Mochida Pharmaceutical Co. and is indicated for hyperlipidemia and peripheral vascular disease. In an outcomes study called the Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study, or JELIS study, which consisted of more than 18,000 patients followed over multiple years, Epadel, when used in conjunction with statins, was shown to reduce cardiovascular events by 19% compared to the use of statins alone. In this study, cardiovascular events decreased by approximately 53% compared to statins alone in the subset of primary prevention patients with triglyceride levels of ≥150 mg/dL (median of 272 mg/dL at entry) and HDL-C <40 mg/dL. Epadel has been approved and available by prescription in Japan for over a decade. In 2013, the Japan Ministry of Health approved Epadel for over-the-counter sales. JELIS provided supportive but not conclusive data that EPA drug therapy may reduce major coronary events. JELIS results cannot be generalized to populations outside of Japan due to limitations in the study’s design. Due to the limitation of JELIS, further study was needed through the REDUCE-IT study to determine the clinical benefit, if any, of EPA therapy in statin-treated patients with elevated triglyceride levels in a patient population beyond that studied in JELIS. 
 Observed Clinical Safety of Vascepa 
 In REDUCE-IT, Vascepa was well tolerated with a safety profile generally consistent with clinical experience associated with omega-3 fatty acids and current FDA-approved labeling of such products. Excluding the MACE results described above, overall adverse event rates in REDUCE-IT were similar across the statin plus Vascepa and the statin plus placebo treatment groups. There were no significant differences between treatments in the overall rate of treatment emergent adverse events or serious adverse events leading to withdrawal of study drug. The one serious adverse event occurring at a frequency of >2% was pneumonia which occurred at a numerically higher rate in the statin plus placebo treatment group (2.9%) than in the statin plus Vascepa treatment group (2.6%). Adverse events occurring in 5% or greater of patients and more frequently with Vascepa than placebo were peripheral edema (6.5% Vascepa patients versus 5.0% placebo patients), constipation (5.4% Vascepa patients versus 3.6% placebo patients), and atrial fibrillation (5.3% Vascepa patients versus 3.9% placebo patients). There were numerically more serious adverse events related to bleeding in the statin plus Vascepa treatment group although overall rates were low with no fatal bleeding observed in either group and no significant difference in adjudicated hemorrhagic stroke or serious central nervous system or gastrointestinal bleeding events between treatments.
 In the MARINE and ANCHOR trials, patients dosed with Vascepa demonstrated a safety profile similar to placebo. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events in the MARINE study or in the ANCHOR study. In the MARINE and ANCHOR trials, the most commonly reported adverse reaction (incidence >2% and greater than placebo) in Vascepa treated patients was arthralgia (joint pain) (2.3% for Vascepa vs. 1.0% for placebo). There was no reported adverse reaction > 3% and greater than placebo.
 Prior to commencing the MARINE, ANCHOR and REDUCE-IT trials, we conducted a pre-clinical program for Vascepa, including toxicology and pharmacology studies. In addition, we previously investigated Vascepa in central nervous system disorders in several double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, including Phase 3 trials in Huntington’s disease. Over 1,000 patients have been dosed with Vascepa in these studies, with over 100 receiving continuous treatment for a year or more. In all studies performed to date, Vascepa has shown a favorable safety and tolerability profile. 
 In addition to the MARINE and ANCHOR trials, we completed a 28-day pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, a 26-week study to evaluate the toxicity of Vascepa in transgenic mice and multiple pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies in 
 12


healthy subjects in which we evaluated the effect of Vascepa on certain common prescription drugs. All findings from these studies were consistent with our expectations and confirmed the overall safety profile of Vascepa.
 Since Vascepa was made commercially available in 2013, more than five million estimated normalized total prescriptions of Vascepa have been reported by Symphony Health.  
 New Lipid Compounds and other Preclinical Programs 
 We are also considering development of other next generation compounds based on our internal lipid science expertise, including potential combination and derivative therapies. 
 In August 2013, we completed dosing of AMR102, a fixed dose combination of Vascepa and a leading statin product. The study is a randomized, open-label, single-dose, 4-way cross-over study to continue testing of the relative bioavailability of AMR102 capsules, Vascepa capsules with the selected statin taken concomitantly, Vascepa taken alone and the selected statin taken alone. The results of this study support the feasibility of AMR102. We have suspended additional development of AMR102 pending FDA approval of label expansion of Vascepa, anticipated to occur no sooner than after FDA review of the results from the REDUCE-IT study. 
 
We believe that Vascepa and other lipid-based compositions may have an impact on a number of biological factors in the body such as anti-inflammatory mechanisms, cell membrane composition and plasticity, triglyceride levels and regulation of glucose metabolism. Currently all other development activities are at formulation or pre-clinical stages. 
 Manufacturing and Supply for Vascepa 
 We manage the manufacturing and supply of Vascepa and have done so since we began clinical development of Vascepa prior to the drug’s marketing approval by the FDA in 2012. We rely on contract manufacturers in each step of our commercial and clinical product supply chain. These steps include active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, manufacturing, encapsulation of the API, product packaging and supply-related logistics. Our approach to product supply procurement is designed to mitigate risk of supply interruption and maintain an environment of cost competition through diversification of contract manufacturers at each stage of the supply chain and lack of reliance on any single supplier.
 The FDA has approved several international large-scale API manufacturers, global encapsulation leaders and two U.S.-based packagers for use in the manufacturing of Vascepa. All of our manufacturing facilities were approved by the FDA following successful preapproval inspections and they remain active manufacturers of Vascepa under FDA authority. 
 The API material that constitutes ethyl-EPA is a chemical modification of a naturally occurring substance that is derived from specific fish sourced from qualified producers. The fishing from which the raw material for Vascepa is derived is regulated by local government agencies under policies designed to ensure sustainability of the marine life supply. A limited number of other manufacturers have the ability, scale, know-how, sufficient supply chain capability and suitable, industrial-scale facilities to produce ethyl-EPA to the required level of purity. Among the conditions for FDA approval of a pharmaceutical product is the requirement that the manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures are validated and conform to pharmaceutical current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, which, under applicable regulations, must be followed at all times. The FDA typically inspects manufacturing facilities before regulatory approval of a product candidate, such as Vascepa, and on a periodic basis after the initial approval. Consistent with cGMP regulations, pharmaceutical manufacturers must expend resources and time to ensure compliance with product specifications as well as production, record keeping, quality control, reporting, and other regulatory requirements. 
 Some of our agreements with our API suppliers are exclusive and include minimum purchase commitments. During 2018, we fully met the aggregate minimum purchase requirements in our supply agreements. Under the supply agreements, we can purchase more than the minimum requirements. Certain of these agreements contemplate phased capacity expansion aimed at creating sufficient volumes to meet anticipated demand for Vascepa. Certain of these agreements contain provisions for reduced payments (fractional API cost) for unmet annual volume requirements. 
 Our Commercialization Plans 
 We currently market Vascepa in the United States through our direct sales force which grew from approximately 170 sales professionals, including sales representatives and their managers, in September 2018 prior to REDUCE-IT results to approximately 440 sales professionals, including approximately 400 sales representatives, to begin 2019. We currently target clinicians who are top prescribers of lipid-regulating therapies, including statins. During the period from January 2013, when Vascepa was commercially launched in the United States, until October 2013, when the FDA notified us that it rescinded the ANCHOR study SPA agreement, our direct sales force consisted of approximately 275 sales representatives. From early 2014 until September 2018, the size of our direct sales force has included approximately 130 to 150 sales representatives with focus on select sales territories that have the greatest 
 13


potential for Vascepa sales growth. After topline REDUCE-IT results were announced in September 2018, we began to hire and train additional sales representatives and started 2019 with approximately 400 sales representatives. 
 From May 2014 through December 2018, in addition to Vascepa promotion by our sales representatives, Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. co-promoted Vascepa in the United States. This co-promotion reached its mutually agreed upon termination date in December 2018. 
 We also employ various medical affairs and marketing personnel to support our commercialization of Vascepa. We expanded certain medical education and market awareness initiatives, including, pilot testing of new promotional initiatives following the reporting of positive REDUCE-IT results in 2018 and we intend to further expand such initiatives following label expansion of Vascepa, subject to FDA approval of such expanded label, as discussed below. Our field sales efforts are further complemented by investments in digital and non-personal channels as well as peer-to-peer (e.g., promotional medical education programs & product theaters) initiatives to further increase Vascepa brand awareness and clarify Vascepa’s unique clinical profile.
 Since commercial launch of Vascepa in January 2013, we have promoted Vascepa based on the MARINE clinical trial data as reflected in the FDA-approved label for Vascepa. In August 2015, we and our co-promotion partner began communicating promotional information beyond MARINE clinical trial data to targeted healthcare professionals. Such qualified communications are being made pursuant to the August 7, 2015 federal district court declaration and related March 2016 settlement allowing truthful and non-misleading promotion of the FDA-reviewed and agreed effects of Vascepa demonstrated in the ANCHOR clinical trial. This promotion also includes information related to the current state of scientific research about the potential of Vascepa to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, including REDUCE-IT data and previously other peer-reviewed scientific publications of available data. 
 After results of REDUCE-IT were available in September 2018 and demonstrated that Vascepa is effective in lowering the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events in statin-treated patients with CV risk factors, we expanded the size of our U.S. direct sales force and continue to expand promotion of Vascepa based on the results of the REDUCE-IT trial. After publication of the primary results of the REDUCE-IT study in The New England Journal of Medicine and scientific presentation of REDUCE-IT results at the 2018 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association (AHA) on November 10, 2018, we updated and expanded our communication of REDUCE-IT results to include the publication and the peer-reviewed information presented in an effort to further ensure that our communications remain truthful and non-misleading. 
 The dataset from Vascepa is large, representing greater than 35,000 patient years of study. Additionally, the list of prespecified endpoints which we intend to evaluate in support of the sNDA is extensive. We intend to submit an sNDA to the FDA in the United States before the end of March 2019 seeking approval to expand the label for Vascepa based on the effects of Vascepa demonstrated in the REDUCE-IT study. Assuming a standard 10-month review by the FDA, we do not expect an expanded label for Vascepa to be available in 2019 or to impact 2019 Vascepa revenue levels. After the sNDA is submitted, Amarin will seek clarification as to whether priority review by the FDA is possible for this important submission.
 Throughout 2019, we expect to continue an efficient expansion of our commercial activities and capabilities directed primarily toward targeted providers and payor decision-makers. We plan to continue to bring the results of REDUCE-IT to healthcare providers and payors, in a manner we believe is both truthful and non-misleading and consistent with our March 2016 settlement. Thus, we are directly connecting Vascepa with the REDUCE-IT data for these target audiences, in advance of having a new label. Further, anticipating the potential receipt of a new, cardiovascular risk reduction indication in the United States, we are preparing a robust, direct to consumer campaign to be launched in earnest after receiving a new label. Concurrently, we also will reassess whether approximately 440 sales professionals, including approximately 400 sales representatives, in conjunction with planned medical education, digital and non-personal outreach levels are adequate and invest appropriately to support the multi-billion-dollar potential of this important new cardiovascular therapy. 
 Outside of the United States, we have expanded our commercialization activities through partnering arrangements in certain territories. In February 2015, we entered into a Development, Commercialization and Supply Agreement, or the DCS Agreement, with Eddingpharm (Asia) Macao Commercial Offshore Limited, or Eddingpharm, related to the development and commercialization of Vascepa in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or the China Territory. Under the DCS Agreement, Eddingpharm will be solely responsible for development and commercialization activities in the China Territory and associated expenses. Additionally, Eddingpharm is required to conduct clinical trials in the China Territory to secure regulatory approval in certain territories. For example, in December 2017, Eddingpharm commenced a pivotal clinical trial aimed to support the regulatory approval of the first indication of Vascepa in a patient population with severe hypertriglyceridemia in Mainland China. Additional clinical development efforts may be necessary in this market. Significant commercialization of Vascepa in the China Territory is several years away, if at all. If Eddingpharm is not able to effectively develop and commercialize Vascepa in the China Territory, we may not be able to generate revenue from the DCS Agreement resulting from the sale of Vascepa in the China Territory. 
 In March 2016, we entered into an agreement with Biologix FZCo, or Biologix, to register and commercialize Vascepa in several Middle Eastern and North African countries. Under the terms of the distribution agreement, we granted to Biologix a non-
 14


exclusive license to use our trademarks in connection with the importation, distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of Vascepa in the Middle East and North Africa territory. Commercialization across the Middle East and North Africa is several years away, if at all, in the most commercially significant territories and subject to similar risks as in the China Territory.
In September 2017, we entered into an agreement with HLS Therapeutics Inc., or HLS, to register, commercialize and distribute Vascepa in Canada. Under the agreement, HLS will be responsible for regulatory and commercialization activities and associated costs. We will be responsible for providing assistance towards local filings, supplying finished product under negotiated supply terms, maintaining intellectual property, and continuing the development and funding of REDUCE-IT. Significant commercialization of Vascepa in Canada is years away, if at all. If HLS Therapeutics is not able to effectively register and commercialize Vascepa in Canada, we may not be able to generate revenue from the agreement as a result of the sale of Vascepa in Canada.
 We continue to assess other partnership opportunities for licensing Vascepa to partners outside of the United States. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our products. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies similar to our products will increase. Many of these and other existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. These companies may develop and introduce products and processes competitive with or superior to ours. In addition, other technologies or products may be developed that have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the intended purposes of our products, which might render our technology and products noncompetitive or obsolete. 
 Our competitors both in the United States and abroad include large, well-established pharmaceutical and generic companies, specialty and generic pharmaceutical sales and marketing companies, and specialized cardiovascular treatment companies. GlaxoSmithKline plc currently sells Lovaza®, a prescription-only omega-3 fatty acid indicated for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, which was approved by FDA in 2004 and has been on the market in the United States since 2005. Multiple generic versions of Lovaza are available in the United States. Other large companies with competitive products include AbbVie, Inc., which currently sells Tricor® and Trilipix® for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia and Niaspan®, which is primarily used to raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or HDL-C, but is also used to lower triglycerides. Multiple generic versions of Tricor, Trilipix and Niaspan are also available in the United States. We compete with these drugs, and in particular, multiple low-cost generic versions of these drugs, in our FDA-approved indicated use and in off-label uses, such as to beneficially affect lipid levels in patients with persistent high triglyceride levels after statin therapy with the aim of potentially lowering cardiovascular risk beyond statin therapy.
 In addition, in May 2014, Epanova® (omega-3-carboxylic acids) capsules, a free fatty acid form of omega-3 (comprised of 55% EPA and 20% DHA), was approved by the FDA for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Epanova was developed by Omthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and is now owned by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP (AstraZeneca). Also, in April 2014, Omtryg, another omega-3-acid fatty acid composition developed by Trygg Pharma AS, received FDA approval for severe hypertriglyceridemia. Neither Epanova nor Omtryg have been commercially launched, but could launch at any time. Each of these competitors, other than Trygg, has greater resources than we do, including financial, product development, marketing, personnel and other resources. Neither Epanova nor Omtryg have been commercially launched.
 AstraZeneca is currently conducting a long-term outcomes study to assess Statin Residual Risk Reduction With EpaNova in HiGh Cardiovascular Risk PatienTs With Hypertriglyceridemia (STRENGTH). The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (corn oil), parallel group design that is believed to have enrolled approximately 13,000 patients with hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL and high risk for cardiovascular disease randomized 1:1 to either corn oil plus statin or Epanova plus statin, once daily, for approximately 3-5 years as determined when the number of major adverse cardiovascular event outcomes is reached. The STRENGTH study is estimated to be completed in 2020, but it could be stopped earlier if, for example, it generates an overwhelming efficacy result. In addition, Kowa Research Institute (a subsidiary of the Japanese company Kowa Co., Ltd) announced in March 2017 that it is initiating a phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial titled PROMINENT examining the effect of pemafibrate (experimental name K-877) in reducing cardiovascular events in Type II diabetic patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Kowa Research Institute has publicly estimated study completion in May 2022, and if successful, U.S. regulatory approval is estimated in mid-2023.  
 During 2018, two outcomes studies were completed of omega-3 mixtures which both failed to achieve their primary endpoints of cardiovascular risk reduction and two meta-analyses were published showing that omega-3 mixtures are not effective in lowering cardiovascular risk. Results of these failed outcomes studies and analysis, while not done with Vascepa, may negatively affect sales of Vascepa. For example, results of VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), as announced immediately before the presentation of REDUCE-IT results at the 2018 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association (AHA) on November 10, 2018, failed to achieve its primary endpoint of lowering cardiovascular events. VITAL was an NIH funded randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial of 2000 IU per day of vitamin D3 and 1 gram per day of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (Lovaza) 
 15


for the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in a nationwide USA cohort of 25,874 adults not selected for elevated cardiovascular or cancer risk. 
 Likewise, in 2018, results from A Study of Cardiovascular Events iN Diabetes (ASCEND) trial were released and showed negligible results for omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily. ASCEND was a British Heart Foundation funded 2x2 factorial design, randomized study to assess whether aspirin 100 mg daily versus placebo and separately, omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily versus placebo, reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in a nationwide UK cohort of over 15,000 individuals with diabetes who do not have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In addition, VITAL showed that supplementation with either omega-3 fatty acid at a dose of 1 gram per day or vitamin D3 at a dose of 2000 IU per day was not effective for primary prevention of CV or cancer events among healthy middle-aged men and women across 5 years of follow up.  
 In meta-analysis, presented in 2018 by the Cochran Foundation and separately as published in JAMA, additional omega-3 studies were evaluated. Similar to the VITAL and ASCEND studies, most of the studies in these omega-3 meta-analyses were of omega-3 mixtures, including DHA, and most were studies of relatively low doses of omega-3 as is associated with dietary supplementation and/or they studied relatively low risk patient populations. The exception was the JELIS study, conducted in Japan, of highly pure EPA which demonstrated a positive outcome benefit. The negative results from such omega-3 mixture studies could create misleading impressions about the use of omega-3s generally, including Vascepa, despite REDUCE-IT positive results and the highly-pure and stable EPA active ingredient in Vascepa and its higher dose regimen. 
 We are also aware of other pharmaceutical companies that are developing products that, if successfully developed, approved and marketed, would compete with Vascepa. Acasti Pharma, or Acasti, a subsidiary of Neptune Technologies & Bioresources Inc., announced in December 2015 that it intends to pursue a regulatory pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, for its omega-3 prescription drug candidate, CaPre® (omega-3 phospholipid), derived from krill oil, for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. In September 2016, Acasti announced positive results from its pivotal bioavailability bridging study comparing CaPre to Lovaza, establishing a scientific bridge between the two that is expected to support the feasibility of a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Acasti initiated a Phase 3 clinical program (TRILOGY) to assess the safety and efficacy of CaPre in patients with very high (≥500 mg/dL) triglycerides in the first quarter of 2018. Acasti completed enrollment in Q4 2018 and study completion is expected by the end of 2019. We believe Micelle BioPharma Inc., or Micelle, is also developing potential treatments for hypertriglyceridemia based on omega-3 fatty acids. To our knowledge, Micelle, after acquiring SC401 from Sancilio & Company, or Sancilio, is pursuing a regulatory pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA for its product and submitted an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, in July 2015. Micelle (Sancilio) completed two pharmacokinetic studies and Phase 2 bioavailability studies (FASTR I&II), with one comparing SC401 to Lovaza. We expect the company or a potential partner to initiate a pivotal clinical Phase 3 study as the next step in development. 
 Matinas BioPharma, Inc. is developing an omega-3-based therapeutic (MAT9001) for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Matinas BioPharma, Inc. filed an IND with the FDA to conduct a human study in the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia and, in June 2015, the company announced topline results for its head-to-head comparative short duration pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of MAT9001 versus Vascepa in patients under conditions inconsistent with the FDA-approved label for Vascepa and presented results based on biomarker modification without outcomes data. In September 2017, Matinas announced that it will be seeking a partner company to develop and commercialize MAT9001. Akcea Therapeutics/Ionis Pharmaceuticals (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals), or Akcea/Ionis, in August 2018 announced the receipt of a complete response letter from the FDA for WAYLIVRA™ (volanesorsen), a drug candidate administered through weekly subcutaneous injections, for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). Akcea will continue to work with the FDA on the path forward for Waylivra for the treatment of FCS. Waylivra continues to be developed for the treatment of familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL). 
 A Phase 3 trial is currently ongoing studying Waylivra (volanesorsen) in patients with FPL (BROADEN trial). Akcea/Ionis expects to file an NDA for FPL in 2019. In January 2017, Akcea/Ionis announced a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Novartis whereby Novartis will help develop (including funding cardiovascular outcomes studies) and commercialize products emerging from this collaboration, including Waylivra (volanesorsen). In June 2018, Gemphire Therapeutics announced positive topline results from a Phase 2b trial (INDIGO-1) of its drug candidate, gemcabene, in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Gemcabene is an oral, once-daily pill for a number of hypercholesterolemic populations and severe hypertriglyceridemia. Gemphire announced plans to initiate a Phase III study for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and non-familial hypercholesterolemia in ASCVD patients in the second half of 2018. In August 2018, the FDA requested that Gemphire conduct an additional long-term toxicity study before commencing any further clinical testing, thereby effectively placing gemcabene on clinical hold. Zydus Cadila has a Phase 2 development program for its lead molecule, Saroglitazar, in various indications, including severe hypertriglyceridemia in the United States. In August 2018, the Company announced that it had suspended the Phase 2 trial in the severe hypertriglyceridemia indication due to study enrollment issues, while it continues development activities in other indications. The product is approved in India under the name Lipaglyn® for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and diabetic dyslipidemia. We are also aware that bezafibrate has been licensed by Intercept Pharmaceuticals to be further developed and potentially launched in the United States market.

Based on prior communications from the FDA, including communications in connection with its review of the ANCHOR indication for Vascepa, it is our understanding that the FDA is not prepared to approve any therapy for treatment of cardiovascular risk based on biomarker modification without outcomes study data, with the potential exception of therapies which lower LDL-cholesterol. In particular, it is our understanding that the FDA is not prepared to approve any therapy based on data demonstrating lowering of triglyceride levels. In our view, this position from the FDA is unlikely to change based on the REDUCE-IT study particularly in light of the independence of the positive benefit demonstrated in the REDUCE-IT study from triglyceride levels and benefit from the REDUCE-IT study supporting that the positive effects of Vascepa are unique to Vascepa and extend beyond triglyceride reduction. If the FDA were to change this position, it could potentially have a negative impact on Amarin by making it easier for other products to achieve a cardiovascular risk reduction indication without the need in advance to conduct a long and expensive cardiovascular outcomes study
 Vascepa also faces competition from dietary supplement companies marketing omega-3 products as nutritional supplements. Such products are classified as food, not as prescription drugs or as over-the-counter drugs, by the FDA. Many of the promoters of such products have greater resources than Amarin and they are not restricted to the same standards as are prescription drugs with respect to promotional claims or manufacturing quality, consistency and subsequent product stability. Though we have taken legal action against supplement manufacturers attempting to use the REDUCE-IT results to promote their products, we cannot be sure physicians and pharmacists will view the FDA-approved prescription-only status, EPA-only purity of Vascepa and stringent regulatory oversight as significant advantages versus omega-3 dietary supplements regardless of clinical study results and other scientific data. 
 In addition, several generic drug companies have sought to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents and have submitted to FDA applications for approval of generic versions of Vascepa. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 Government Regulation and Regulatory Matters 
 Any product development activities related to Vascepa or products that we may develop or acquire in the future will be subject to extensive regulation by various government authorities, including the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, which regulate the design, research, clinical and non-clinical development, testing, manufacturing, storage, distribution, import, export, labeling, advertising and marketing of pharmaceutical products and devices. Generally, before a new drug can be sold, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. The data is generated in two distinct development stages: pre-clinical and clinical. Drugs must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they are first marketed in the United States. For new chemical entities, the pre-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation, determining the manufacturing process and controls, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies which support subsequent clinical testing. 
 The clinical stage of development can generally be divided into Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. In Phase 1, generally, a small number of healthy volunteers are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these studies is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. Phase 2 trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected. Phase 3 trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites, in multiple countries and are designed to provide the pivotal data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. 
 United States Drug Development 
 In the United States, the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Prior to the start of human clinical studies for a new drug in the United States, preclinical laboratory and animal tests are often performed under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices regulations, or GLP, and an investigational new drug application, or IND, is filed with the FDA. Similar filings are required in other countries; however, data requirements and other information needed for a complete submission may differ in other countries. The amount of data that must be supplied in the IND depends on the phase of the 
 17


study. Phase 1 studies typically require less data than larger Phase 3 studies. A clinical plan must be submitted to the FDA prior to commencement of a clinical trial. If the FDA has concerns about the clinical plan or the safety of the proposed studies, it may suspend or terminate the study at any time. Studies must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and regular reporting of study progress and any adverse experiences is required. Studies are also subject to review by independent institutional review boards, or IRBs, responsible for overseeing studies at particular sites and protecting human research study subjects. An independent IRB may also suspend or terminate a study once initiated. 
 NDA and FDA Review Process 
 Following trial completion, trial data is analyzed to determine safety and efficacy. Data is then filed with the FDA in an NDA along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing and testing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality. The NDA must contain proof of safety, purity, potency and efficacy, which entails extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before first marketing of a drug in the United States. 
 The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in iterative discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of applications by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete. The FDA may conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and may also audit data from clinical and pre-clinical trials. 
 There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States. Even if future indications for Vascepa are approved, the FDA’s review will be lengthy, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. After approving any drug product, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or it may place conditions on approvals including potential requirements or risk management plans that could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
Off-label Promotion in the United States 
 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, has been interpreted by the FDA and the U.S. government to make it illegal for pharmaceutical companies to promote their FDA-approved products for uses that have not been approved by the FDA. Companies that market drugs for off-label uses or indications have been subject to related costly litigation, criminal penalties and civil liability under the FDCA and the False Claims Act. However, recent case law has called into question the extent to which government in the United States, including FDA, can, and is willing to seek to, prevent truthful and non-misleading speech related to off-label uses of FDA-approved products such as Vascepa.
 In May 2015, we and a group of independent physicians filed a lawsuit against the FDA seeking a federal court declaration that would permit us and our agents to promote to healthcare professionals the use of Vascepa in the ANCHOR population and promote on the potential of Vascepa to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease so long as the promotion is truthful and non-misleading. This use of Vascepa at issue reflected recognized medical practice but was not approved by the FDA and is thus not covered by current FDA-approved labeling for the drug. Promotion of an off-label use has generally been considered by the FDA to be illegal under the FDCA. The lawsuit, captioned Amarin Pharma, Inc., et al. v. Food & Drug Administration, et al., 119 F. Supp. 3d 196 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In the lawsuit, we contended principally that FDA regulations limiting off-label promotion of truthful and non-misleading information are unconstitutional under the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as applied in the case of our proposed promotion of Vascepa. The physicians in the suit regularly treated patients at risk of cardiovascular disease and, as the complaint contended, have First Amendment rights to receive truthful and non-misleading information from Amarin. The suit was based on the principle that better informed physicians make better treatment decisions for their patients. The FDA opposed this lawsuit but did not dispute the veracity of the subject ANCHOR clinical trial data (the safety data from which was already and currently is in FDA-approved labeling of Vascepa) or the peer-reviewed research related to Vascepa and the potential for cardiovascular risk reduction. 
 In connection with this litigation, the FDA sent a detailed letter to us on June 5, 2015 that confirmed the validity of the ANCHOR trial results. The letter also sought to clarify how, in the FDA’s view, applicable law and FDA policies apply to the communications proposed in our complaint. The FDA stated in this letter that it did not have concerns with much of the information we proposed to communicate and provided us with guidance on the FDA’s view of lawful, but limited paths for the dissemination and communication to healthcare professionals of the effects of Vascepa demonstrated in the ANCHOR clinical trial and use of peer-reviewed scientific publications in the context of appropriate disclaimers. 
 In August 2015, we were granted preliminary relief in this lawsuit through the court’s declaratory judgment that confirmed we may engage in truthful and non-misleading speech promoting the off-label use of Vascepa to healthcare professionals, i.e., to treat patients with persistently high triglycerides, and that such speech may not form the basis of a misbranding action under the FDCA. In 
 18


August 2015, we began to communicate promotional information beyond the MARINE indication to healthcare professionals in the United States as permitted by this court declaration. The FDA did not appeal the court’s ruling. 
 In March 2016, we settled this litigation under terms by which the FDA and the U.S. government agreed to be bound by the conclusions from the federal court order that we may engage in truthful and non-misleading speech promoting the off-label use of Vascepa and that certain statements and disclosures that we proposed to make to healthcare professionals were truthful and non-misleading. As part of the settlement, given, as expressed in the court’s opinion, that the dynamic nature of science and medicine is that knowledge is ever-advancing and that a statement that is fair and balanced one day may become incomplete or otherwise misleading in the future as new studies are done and new data is acquired, we agreed that we bear the responsibility to ensure that our communications regarding off-label use of Vascepa remain truthful and non-misleading, consistent with the federal court ruling.
 While we believe we are now permitted under our settlement and the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to more broadly promote Vascepa, the FDA-approved labeling for Vascepa did not change as a result of this litigation and settlement. In addition, under our settlement, neither government nor other third-party coverage or reimbursement to pay for the off-label use of Vascepa was required. Based on our communications with the FDA, we expect that the FDA’s review and analysis of our final positive results from the REDUCE-IT outcomes study will be required for FDA-approved label expansion for Vascepa. However, we proactively communicate results from the REDUCE-IT trial in a manner we believe is truthful and non-misleading and thus protected under the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
 Even though we have the benefit of a final settlement in this litigation, our promotion is still subject to a high, perhaps abnormally high, degree of scrutiny to ensure that our promotion remains within the scope covered by the settlement. For example, under the settlement, we remain responsible for ensuring our speech is truthful and non-misleading. Data arising from studies of drug products are complex, such as the many studies that we believe show supportive but not conclusive research on the potential connection between the effects of EPA, the active ingredient in Vascepa, and cardiovascular risk reduction (e.g., the JELIS trial of a highly-pure EPA product in Japan by Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Mochida, and other data using a variety of levels of evidence that connect EPA to favorable effects toward reduced cardiovascular risk). We, the FDA, the U.S. government, our competitors and other interested parties may not agree on the truthfulness and non-misleading nature of our promotional materials with respect to the outcome of these trials or other direct or indirect claims we make about Vascepa. Likewise, the FDA, the U.S. government, our competitors and other interested parties may not agree on the truthfulness and non-misleading nature of our promotional materials related to the REDUCE-IT results. Federal and state governments or agencies may also seek to find other means to prevent our promotion of unapproved truthful and non-misleading information about Vascepa. If our promotional activities or other operations are found to be in violation of any law or governmental regulation through existing or new interpretations, we may be subject to prolonged litigation, penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Also, if governmental parties or our competitors view our claims as misleading or false, we could also be subject to liability based on fair competition-based statutes, such as the Lanham Act. Any of such negative circumstances could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 Foreign Regulation of New Drug Compounds 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we may be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in all or most foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Similarly, clinical trials conducted in countries such as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, require review and approval of clinical trial proposals by an ethics committee, which provides a combined ethical and scientific review process. Most countries in which clinical studies are conducted require the approval of the clinical trial proposals by both the regulatory body and ethics committee. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP, which have their origin in the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki, the applicable regulatory requirements, and guidelines developed by the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, for GCP practices in clinical trials. 
 Post-Marketing Requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company generally must engage in numerous specific monitoring and recordkeeping activities, such as routine safety surveillance, and must continue to submit periodic and other reports to the applicable 
 19


regulatory agencies, including any cases of adverse events and appropriate quality control records. Such reports submitted to the FDA may result in changes to the label and/or other post-marketing requirements or actions, including product withdrawal. These are viable risks once a product is on the market. Additionally, modifications or enhancements to the products or labeling or changes of site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. 
 Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA. 
 In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with pharmaceutical cGMPs, and NDA holders must list their products and register their manufacturing establishments with the FDA. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. 
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict certain marketing practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. 
 The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for a referral or the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any healthcare facility, item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Liability may be established without a person or entity having actual knowledge of the federal anti-kickback statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants or patient or product support programs. 
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making or using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing, or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated or faced enforcement actions under the federal civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities, including allegations that they caused false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus allegedly non-reimbursable, uses. Federal enforcement agencies also have showed increased interest in pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs. 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), collectively referred to herein as HIPAA, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payor and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. In addition, HITECH imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
 20


 The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. 
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Other states or localities may have laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs; require drug manufacturers to report information related to clinical trials, or information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and/or require identification or licensing of sales representatives. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the exceptions or safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. 
 If our promotional activities or other operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us through existing or new interpretations, we may be subject to prolonged litigation, penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Also, if governmental parties or our competitors view our claims as misleading or false, we could also be subject to liability based on fair competition-based statutes, such as the Lanham Act. Any of such negative circumstances could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers. In addition, there has been renewed interest in amending the Social Security Act to allow Medicare to negotiate prices for prescription drugs covered under Medicare Part B. If this were to be enacted by Congress and signed by the President, the prices we obtain for our products covered under Part B could be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain, and it could exert a similar lowering pressure on payments from non-governmental payers. 
 The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), established by the MMA and provided additional funding by The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, conducts comparative effectiveness research on different treatments for the same illness. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, is it possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.

In March 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, that began in 2011;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, and certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. In addition, there have been efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA and to alter the implementation of the ACA and related laws. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amended the Medicare statute, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly known as the “donut hole,” by raising the manufacturer discount under the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program to 70%. It is unclear how the ACA and its implementation, as well as efforts to repeal or replace, or invalidate, the ACA, or portions thereof, will affect our business. It is possible that the ACA will continue to exert pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the ACA remain possible. 
 Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Our ability to successfully commercialize our product depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement and copayment levels. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products. Even with studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost effective than other products, and third-party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, in whole or in part.
 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. We anticipate that the United States Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures include: controls on government funded reimbursement for drugs; new or increased requirements to pay prescription drug rebates to government healthcare programs; controls on healthcare providers; challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; requirements to try less expensive products or generics before a more expensive branded product; changes in drug importation laws; expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person; and public funding for cost effectiveness research, which may be used by government and private third-party payors to make coverage and payment decisions. Further, federal budgetary concerns could result in the implementation of significant federal spending cuts, including cuts in Medicare and other health related spending in the near term. For example, beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required law and this reduction runs to 2027. These cuts reduce reimbursement payments related to our products, which could potentially negatively impact our revenue.
 Payors also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and Actual Acquisition Cost. CMS surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. It is difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement 
 22


mechanics on the willingness of payors to cover our products. We participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, the 340B drug pricing program, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Part B of the Medicare program. 
 Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and Medicaid rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. 
 In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we participate in the VA/FSS pricing program. Under this program, we are obligated to make our products available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies - the VA, U.S. Department of Defense, Public Health Service and U.S. Coast Guard - that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP. The FCP is based on the non-federal average manufacturer price, or Non-FAMP, which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. We also participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, under which we pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy network to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP.  
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate program, 340B program, and VA/FSS pricing program, and the risks relating to price reporting and other obligations under these programs, are further discussed under the heading “If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 FDA Marketing Exclusivity and Generic Competition 
 The FDCA, as amended by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, provides for market exclusivity provisions that can help protect the exclusivity of new drugs by delaying the acceptance and final approval of certain competitive drug applications. NCE marketing exclusivity precludes approval during the five-year exclusivity period of certain 505(b)(2) applications and abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, submitted by another company for another version of the drug. The timelines and conditions under the ANDA process that permit the start of patent litigation and allow the FDA to approve generic versions of brand name drugs like Vascepa differ based on whether a drug receives three-year, or five-year, NCE marketing exclusivity. In May 2016, after significant litigation, FDA determined that Vascepa is eligible for NCE marketing exclusivity. Accordingly, we believe a related 30-month stay is currently in place with respect to our 1-gram dose strength of Vascepa that is scheduled to continue until January 26, 2020, seven-and-a-half years from FDA approval of Vascepa, unless related patent litigation is resolved against us sooner.
 The FDA typically makes a determination on marketing exclusivity in connection with an NDA approval of a drug for a new indication. FDA marketing exclusivity is separate from, and in addition to, patent protection, trade secrets and manufacturing barriers to entry which could also help protect Vascepa against generic competition. 
 We applied to the FDA for five-year, NCE marketing exclusivity for Vascepa in connection with the NDA for our MARINE indication, which NDA was approved by the FDA on July 26, 2012. On February 21, 2014, in connection with the July 26, 2012 approval of the MARINE indication, the FDA denied a grant of five-year NCE marketing exclusivity to Vascepa and granted three-year marketing exclusivity. Under applicable regulations, such three-year exclusivity would have extended through July 25, 2015 and would have been supplemented by a 30-month stay triggered by patent litigation that would have extended into September 2016, unless such patent litigation was resolved against us sooner. 
 NCE marketing exclusivity precludes approval during the five-year exclusivity period of certain 505(b)(2) applications and ANDAs submitted by another company for another version of the drug. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. In such case, the pioneer drug company is afforded the benefit of a 30-month stay against the launch of such a competitive product that extends from the end of the five-year exclusivity period. A pioneer company could also be afforded extensions to the stay under applicable regulations, including a six-month pediatric exclusivity extension or a judicial extension if applicable requirements are met. A drug sponsor could also gain a form of marketing 
 23


exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments if such company can, under certain circumstances, complete a human clinical trial process and obtain regulatory approval of its product.
 In contrast, a three-year period of exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments is generally granted for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved, such as when the application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted by the sponsor that were essential to approval of the application. Accordingly, we expect to receive three-year exclusivity in connection with any future regulatory approvals of Vascepa, such as an approval sought based on positive REDUCE-IT outcomes study results. Such three-year exclusivity protection precludes the FDA from approving a marketing application for an ANDA, a product candidate that the FDA views as having the same conditions of approval as Vascepa (for example, the same indication and/or other conditions of use), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted to the FDA with Vascepa as the reference product, for a period of three years from the date of FDA approval. The FDA may accept and commence review of such applications during the three-year exclusivity period. Such three-year exclusivity grant does not prevent a company from challenging the validity of patents at any time, subject to any prior four-year period pending from a grant of five-year exclusivity. This three-year form of exclusivity may also not prevent the FDA from approving an NDA that relies only on its own data to support the change or innovation.
 On February 27, 2014, we sued the FDA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to challenge the agency’s denial of five-year NCE exclusivity for Vascepa, based on our reading of the relevant statute, our view of FDA’s inconsistency with its past actions in this area and the retroactive effect of what we believe is a new policy at FDA as it relates to our situation. On May 28, 2015, the court granted our motion for summary judgment. The decision vacated the FDA’s denial of our claim for such exclusivity and remanded to the FDA for proceedings consistent with the decision. On July 22, 2015, Watson Laboratories Inc., the purported first Vascepa ANDA filer, sought to intervene and appeal the court’s decision. We and FDA opposed this intervention effort. The applicable courts denied Watson the relief sought and appeal periods have expired. 
 On May 31, 2016, in a reversal that FDA and we view as consistent with the court’s May 28, 2015 summary judgment motion, FDA determined that Vascepa is eligible for five-year, NCE marketing exclusivity. We believe this determination provides Vascepa with the benefits of NCE exclusivity afforded by statute. NCE exclusivity for Vascepa ran from its date of FDA approval on July 26, 2012 and extended until July 26, 2017. We believe the statutory NCE-related 30-month stay triggered by the 1-gram dose patent litigation following generic application submissions permitted on July 26, 2016 is scheduled to continue until January 26, 2020, seven-and-a-half years from FDA approval, unless such patent litigation is resolved against us sooner. 
 It is possible, but unlikely at this time given the time remaining in the 30-month stay, that FDA’s NCE determination and related 30-month stay could be challenged by interested parties. If challenged, we plan to vigorously defend exclusivity for Vascepa. Any such challenge could have a negative impact on our company and create uncertainty around the continued benefits associated with exclusivity that we believe are applicable to us under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. 
 Regulatory exclusivity is in addition to exclusivity afforded by issued patents related to Vascepa.
 Other Regulatory Matters 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion, importation, and other activities related to approved products are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities, including, in the United States, the FDA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. Sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must comply with the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute, and the False Claims Act and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw a product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 24


Changes in regulations or statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 Patents, Proprietary Technology, Trade Secrets 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, technology and know-how, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and to protect our products with our intellectual property will depend in large part on our ability to: 

• | obtain, defend and maintain patent protection and market exclusivity for our current and future products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preserve any trade secrets relating to our current and future products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | acquire patented or patentable products and technologies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have prosecuted, and are currently prosecuting, multiple patent applications to protect the intellectual property developed during the Vascepa development program. As of the date of this report, we had 79 patent applications in the United States that have been either issued or allowed and more than 30 additional patent applications are pending in the United States. Such 79 allowed and issued applications include the following: 
  
• | 2 issued U.S. patents directed to a pharmaceutical composition of Vascepa in a capsule that have terms that expire in 2020 and 2030, respectively;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 1 issued U.S. patent covering a composition containing highly pure EPA that expires in 2021;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 43 U.S. patents covering or related to the use of Vascepa in either the MARINE or ANCHOR populations that have terms that expire in 2030 or later;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 11 U.S. patents covering or related to the use of Vascepa in the REDUCE-IT population with terms expiring in 2033 or later;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 4 additional patents related to the use of a pharmaceutical composition comprised of free fatty acids to treat the ANCHOR patient population with a term that expires in 2030 or later;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 2 additional patents related to the use of a pharmaceutical composition comprised of free fatty acids to treat the MARINE patient population with a term that expires in 2030;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 3 additional patents related to the use of a pharmaceutical composition comprised of free fatty acids to treat the REDUCE-IT population expiring 2033;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 1 additional patent related to a pharmaceutical composition comprised of free fatty acids and uses thereof to treat both the MARINE and ANCHOR patient populations with a term that expires in 2030;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 1 additional patent related to the use of a pharmaceutical composition comprised of re-esterified EPA triglyceride to treat the REDUCE-IT population expiring 2033;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 3 additional patents related to a formulation of EPA/DHA and uses thereof with a term that expires in 2030;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 2 additional patents related to the use of Vascepa to treat obesity with a term that expires in 2034;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 2 additional patents covering a pharmaceutical composition comprised of EPA and a hydroxyl compound with a term that expires in 2034; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 4 additional patents covering a new combination therapy comprised of EPA and another drug.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A Notice of Allowance is issued after the USPTO makes a determination that a patent can be granted from an application. A Notice of Allowance does not afford patent protection until the underlying patent is issued by the USPTO. No assurance can be given that applications with issued notices of allowance will be issued as patents or that any of our pending patent applications will issue as patents. No assurance can be given that, if and when issued, our patents will prevent competitors from competing with Vascepa. For example, we may choose to not assert all issued patents in patent litigation and patents or claims within patents may be determined to be invalid.
 We are the owner of the above-listed patents. We are also the exclusive licensee of certain patents owned by others covering products in development. To secure our debt under our outstanding royalty-like instrument, we have granted the holders of such instrument a security interest in our Vascepa-related patents.  
 25


We are also pursuing patent applications related to Vascepa in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States. We may be dependent in some cases upon third-party licensors to pursue filing, prosecution and maintenance of patent rights or applications owned or controlled by those parties, including, for example, under our collaboration with Mochida. It is possible that third parties will obtain patents or other proprietary rights that might be necessary or useful to us. In cases where third parties are first to invent a particular product or technology, or first to file after various provisions of the America Invents Act of 2011 went into effect on March 16, 2013, it is possible that those parties will obtain patents that will be sufficiently broad so as to prevent us from utilizing such technology or commercializing our current and future products.
 Although we intend to make reasonable efforts to protect our current and future intellectual property rights and to ensure that any proprietary technology we acquire or develop does not infringe the rights of other parties, we may not be able to ascertain the existence of all potentially conflicting claims. Therefore, there is a risk that third parties may make claims of infringement against our current or future products or technologies. In addition, third parties may be able to obtain patents that prevent the sale of our current or future products or require us to obtain a license and pay significant fees or royalties in order to continue selling such products. 
 We may in the future discover the existence of products that infringe patents that we own or that have been licensed to us. If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to stop such an infringement, such proceedings could be costly and time consuming, regardless of the outcome. No assurances can be given that we would prevail, and it is possible that, during such a proceeding, our patent rights could be held to be invalid, unenforceable or both. Although we intend to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how through confidentiality agreements with our manufacturers, employees and consultants, we may not be able to prevent parties subject to such confidentiality agreements from breaching these agreements or third parties from independently developing or learning of our trade secrets. 
 We anticipate that competitors may from time to time oppose our efforts to obtain patent protection for new technologies or to submit patented technologies for regulatory approvals. Competitors may seek to oppose our patent applications to delay the approval process or to challenge our granted patents, for example, by requesting a reexamination of our patent at the USPTO, or by filing an opposition in a foreign patent office, even if the opposition or challenge has little or no merit. For example, one of our patents was revoked in an opposition proceeding in Europe due to a determination of improper claim amendments under a provision of law not applicable in the United States. Such proceedings are generally highly technical, expensive, and time consuming, and there can be no assurance that such a challenge would not result in the narrowing or complete revocation of any patent of ours that was so challenged.
