Overview
 
Blink Charging Co., through its consolidated owned subsidiaries, is a leading manufacturer, owner, operator, and provider of electric vehicle (“EV”) charging equipment and networked EV charging services in the rapidly growing U.S. and international markets for EVs. Blink offers residential and commercial EV charging equipment and services, enabling EV drivers to recharge at various location types. Blink’s principal line of products and services is its nationwide Blink EV charging networks (the “Blink Networks”) and Blink EV charging equipment, also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (“EVSE”), and other EV-related services. The Blink Networks are a proprietary, cloud-based system that operates, maintains and manages Blink charging stations and handles the associated charging data, back-end operations and payment processing. The Blink Networks provide property owners, managers, parking companies, and state and municipal entities (“Property Partners”), among other types of commercial customers, with cloud-based services that enable the remote monitoring and management of EV charging stations. The Blink Networks also provide EV drivers with vital station information, including station location, availability, and fees (as applicable).
 
In order to capture more revenues derived from providing EV charging equipment to commercial customers and to help differentiate Blink in the EV infrastructure market, Blink offers Property Partners a comprehensive range of solutions for EV charging equipment and services that generally fall into one of the business models below, differentiated by who bears the costs of installation, equipment, maintenance, and the percentage of revenue shared.
 

● | In our Blink-owned turnkey business model, we incur the costs of the charging equipment and installation. We own and operate the EV charging station and provide connectivity of the charging station to the Blink Networks. In this model, which favors recurring revenues, we incur most costs associated with the EV charging stations; thus, we retain substantially all EV charging revenues after deducting network connectivity and processing fees. Typically, our agreement with the Property Partner lasts seven years with extensions that can bring it to a total of up to 21 years.

● | In our Blink-owned hybrid business model, we incur the costs of the charging equipment while the Property Partner incurs the costs of installation. We own and operate the EV charging station and provide connectivity to the Blink Networks. In this model, the Property Partner incurs the installation costs associated with the EV station; thus, we share a more generous portion of the EV charging revenues with the Property Partner generated from the EV charging station after deducting network connectivity and processing fees. Typically, our agreement with the Property Partner lasts five years with extensions that can bring it up to 15 years. 
● | In our host-owned business model, the Property Partner purchases, owns and operates the Blink EV charging station and incurs the installation costs. We work with the Property Partner by providing site recommendations, connectivity to the Blink Networks, payment processing, and optional maintenance services. In this model, the Property Partner retains and keeps all the EV charging revenues after deducting network connectivity and processing fees. 
● | In our Blink-as-a-Service model, we own and operate the EV charging station, while the Property Partner incurs the installation costs. The Property Partner pays us a fixed monthly fee for the service and keeps all the EV charging revenues after deducting network connectivity and processing fees. Typically, our agreement with the Property owner lasts five years. 

 
We also own and operate a ride-sharing program through our wholly owned subsidiary, BlueLA Rideshare, LLC (“BlueLA”), with the City of Los Angeles. The program allows customers the ability to rent electric vehicles through a subscription service and charge those cars through our charging stations.
 
As part of our mission to facilitate the adoption of EVs through the deployment and operation of EV charging infrastructure globally, we are dedicated to slowing climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by road vehicles. With the goal of being a leader in the build out of EV charging infrastructure and of maximizing our share of the EV charging market, we have established strategic commercial, municipal and retail partnerships across industry verticals and encompassing numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use, municipal sites, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations.
 
During 2022, we were awarded several new prominent customers including Mitsubishi, Cushman & Wakefield, Triple J, Q-Park, Best Buy, UBS, Bosch Mexico, Porsche Puerto Rico and Guatemala, Veris Residential, Greystar, Cambium, and cities of Atlanta, Rockford, Newton, Winslow, Leeds (UK) and others that expand our potential for unit sales and deployments. Through acquisitions of SemaConnect and Electric Blue (“Electric Blue”) in 2022, we acquired a number of prominent customers such as Walgreens, Olive Garden, Dunkin Donuts, Kaiser Permanente, Hilton, Ritz-Carlton, and many others. During 2021, we were awarded several prominent customers including General Motors, Ford, Jaguar-Land Rover, Hyundai, Kia, Subaru, AutoNation, Berkshire-Hathaway Automotive, Bridgestone, the City of San Antonio, the Related Group. Commensurate with these new business relationships, we also forged critical strategic relationships with organizations that directly or indirectly influence EV charging stations purchase decisions. Examples include the Florida Sheriff’s Association Cooperative, Illinois Region 1 Planning Council, AES El Salvador, and Vizient, which is the largest member-driven healthcare performance improvement company in the United States, representing more than $130 billion in annual purchasing volume.

In 2022, through the acquisitions of SemaConnect and Electric Blue, we added new offices in Bowie, Maryland and St. Albans, United Kingdom and manufacturing facilities in Bowie, Maryland and Bangalore, India. These new office and manufacturing facilities add to our expanding U.S. and international capacity to develop and manufacture hardware and innovate new software capabilities to better meet the needs of an evolving EV charging landscape, while also serving as a key hub for operations serving the Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. This expansion in footprint is within our strategic goal to grow our global engineering teams and develop operational hubs to facilitate international expansion into new international regions.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we sold or deployed 66,478 chargers, of which 50,167 were in the Blink Networks (31,320 Level 2 publicly accessible commercial chargers, 17,613 Level 2 private commercial chargers, 199 DC Fast Charging EV publicly accessible chargers, 116 DC Fast Charging EV private chargers, and 919 residential Level 2 Blink EV chargers, inclusive of 4,802 chargers pending to be commissioned). Included in the Blink Networks are 4,851 chargers owned by us. The remaining 16,478 were non-networked, on other networks or international sales or deployments (937 Level 2 commercial chargers, 151 DC Fast Charging chargers, 11,611 residential Level 2 Blink EV chargers, 2,311 sold to other U.S. networks, 1,221 sold internationally and 80 deployed internationally). The charger units noted above are net of swap-out or replacement units.
 
Being among the largest owner and operators of EV charging stations, we understand our corporate social responsibility and are committed to making the world a cleaner, better place. By focusing on the environmental, social, and governance risks and opportunities for our business, we continue to strengthen our position in the EV industry as a value-adding and responsible service provider within the ecosystem. In maintaining sustainable procurement, we intend to persist in aligning ourselves with partners who also believe in the betterment of society and use ethical business practices. As our technology develops, we are devoted to creating recycling programs to ensure that older products are repurposed.
 
Industry Overview
 
The market for plug-in electric vehicles experienced significant growth in recent years with EV adoption hitting an all-time high with 6% in 2022 in U.S. and growing 11% year over year. We anticipate this to continue to grow in 2023, driven by new EVs being introduced to the market as major automakers ramp up their production of EVs, and sales are expected to increase as the technology continues to improve and prices come down.
 
The adoption of EVs was also propelled by the “Stay-at-Home Orders” in 2020 and the resulting reductions in global carbon dioxide emissions that showcased the potential of cleaner, lower-emission air quality worldwide.
 
In addition, the advancements made in battery technology have allowed EVs to achieve approximate cost parity with internal combustion engine vehicles and have extended driving range and consumer confidence moving the market away from range anxiety toward range confidence, creating further consumer demand.
 
We also are seeing the U.S. Administration and private companies’ focus on climate initiatives and its large-scale commitment and investment in developing and expanding the EV charging infrastructure making it easier for drivers to own and use EVs.
 
Electric vehicle demand has also been spurred by government incentive and regulations at federal, state and local levels. Government agencies around the world are expected to continue providing incentives for the purchase of EVs, and regulations may be introduced to reduce emissions and encourage the use of clean energy vehicles. At the U.S. federal level, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is to provide $7.5 billion for EV charging network across United States for both DCFC and Level 2 chargers. At state level, California, Oregon, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts among other states, have created mandates for EVs to achieve more than 6.8 million EVs on the road by 2030 and many states provide additional EV incentives to consumers. Further, a shift towards EV car-sharing has boosted the transition to EV fleets, leading to increased EV charging station demand.
 
2022 saw a revolution made towards EVs and 2023 does not look to slow down as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) continue to actively invest in research and development to speed up the production and deployment of EVs. As governments around the world are providing incentives and subsidies to promote the adoption of EVs, it is further fueling the growth of the industry.
 
The result is a rapidly expanding market for electric vehicles, with increasing numbers of models available and improved infrastructure to support them. In 2022, many auto manufacturers such as Mercedes, Ford and General Motors brought dozens of new electric vehicle models to market and much of this production kicks into gear starting in 2023 and 2024. Some estimates are that by 2025, there could be 74 different electric vehicle models offered in North America as the number of EVs on U.S. roads is now projected to reach 26.4 million in 2030.
 
As a pioneer in the EV charging industry, we continue to lead as market demands for a robust charging infrastructure increase. We are the only EV charging company to offer complete vertical integration from research and development and manufacturing to EV charger ownership and operations. This vertical integration creates unparalleled opportunities to control our supply chain and accelerate our go-to-market speed while reducing operating costs. We believe this opportunistically positions us to meet this demand both domestically and globally.

Vertically Integrated Supply Chain, Engineering and Manufacturing. With the acquisition of SemaConnect, we have become the only vertically integrated charging company in the United States and among the few in the world. We believe this strategy provides multiple benefits among which are the bottom-up approach to design and engineering, compliance with “Buy American” hardware requirements, controlling the supply chain timing and costs, ensuring adequate levels of inventory in constrained markets, and ability to capture the manufacturing margin in a high-demand environment.
 
Differentiated but Flexible Business Models. We own, operate and supply proprietary electric vehicle charging equipment and networked EV charging services. We believe that our ability to flexibly provide various business models, including a comprehensive turnkey solution, to Property Partners and leverage our technology to meet both Property Partners’ and EV drivers’ needs provides us competitive advantage in addition to more compelling long-term growth opportunities than possible through equipment sales only.
 
Ownership and Control of EV Charging Stations and Services. We own a considerable percentage of our charging stations, which is a significant differentiation between us and some of our primary competitors. This ownership model allows us to control the settings and pricing for our EV charging services, service the equipment as necessary, and have more effective brand management and price uniformity. As for those stations that we do not own, we are using our best efforts to encourage their owners to keep the stations operating in good order and, in some cases, to replace faulty stations with our new charging stations equipment.
 
Experience with Products and Services of Other EV Charging Service Providers. From our early days and through our acquisitions, we have had the experience of owning and operating EV charging equipment manufactured by other EV charging service providers, including General Electric, ChargePoint, Tellus, and Tritium. This experience has provided us with the working knowledge of other equipment manufacturers’ benefits and drawbacks and their applicable EV charging networks.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Our objective is to continue becoming a vertically integrated leading provider of EV charging solutions by deploying mass-scale EV charging infrastructure. By doing so, we aim to enable the accelerated growth of EV adoption and the EV industry. Key elements of our growth strategy include:

● | Pursue Strategic Opportunities to Expand Blink-Owned Turnkey and Hybrid Models. We have structured our business to identify and pursue opportunities to develop Blink’s owner and operator business model with locations with potential high utilization, where grant funds are available, and where we can realize long-term benefit for the EV charging location and establish long-term recurring revenue relationships. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Relentless Focus on Customer Satisfaction.

Our key service solutions allow us to remain technology agnostic so that we can onboard OCPP compliant equipment from other manufacturers onto our newly designed network. 
● | Strengthen and Support our Human Capital. Our experienced employees and management team are our most valuable resources. Attracting, training, and retaining key personnel has been and will remain critical to our success. To achieve our human capital goals, we intend to stay focused on providing our personnel with entrepreneurial opportunities to expand our business within their areas of expertise. We will also continue to provide our personnel with personal and professional growth opportunities, including additional training, performance-based incentives such as opportunities for stock ownership, and other competitive benefits. 
● | Expand Sales and Marketing Resources. We intend to invest in sales and marketing infrastructure to capitalize on the growth in the market and expand our go-to-market strategy. Today, we use a direct sales force, as well as resellers, and will continue expanding through the use of independent sales agents, utilities, solar distributors, contractors, automotive manufacturers and dealers.

● | Leverage Our Early Mover Advantage. We continue to leverage our extensive and defendable first-mover advantage and the digital customer experience we have created for both EV drivers and Property Partners. We believe that hundreds of thousands of Blink driver registrants appreciate the value of transacting charging sessions on established robust networks. Blink chargers are deployed mainly across the United States, Europe and South America, and the tendency, among users, is to stay within one consistent network. 
● | Appropriately Capitalize Our Business. We continue to pursue new potential capital sources to deliver critical operational objectives and the necessary resources to execute our overall strategy. The EV charging industry as a whole is undercapitalized to deliver the full potential of the expected EV market growth in the near future. We expect to retain our leadership position with new growth capital as required. 
● | International Expansion with Three Recent Acquisitions. On June 15, 2022, we completed the acquisition of SemaConnect, Inc., a leading provider of EV charging infrastructure solutions in North America with manufacturing facilities in both the United States and India. Upon the closing of the acquisition, SemaConnect became a wholly owned subsidiary of our company, allowing Blink to comply with “Buy America” mandates and adding nearly 13,000 active chargers and over 150,000 registered users to the Blink Networks. On April 22, 2022, pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated April 22, 2022, we acquired, through our wholly owned subsidiary in the Netherlands, Blink Holdings B.V., all the outstanding capital stock of Electric Blue Limited, a private company limited by shares and registered in England and Wales (“EB”), from its shareholders. Headquartered in St. Albans, United Kingdom, EB is a leading provider of electric vehicle charging and sustainable energy solutions and technologies. 
● | On May 10, 2021, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary in the Netherlands, Blink Holdings, B.V., closed on the acquisition of the outstanding capital stock of a Belgian company, Blue Corner NV (“Blue Corner”), from its shareholders. Headquartered in Belgium, with sales representative offices in several other European cities, Blue Corner owns and operates an EV charging network across Europe. The acquisition of Blue Corner was made to enter the European market and provide an opportunity to expand our footprint in this region. 

Sales
 
Our sales organization builds and maintains long-term business relationships with our customers by utilizing our four core business models. These business models provide a high degree of flexibility to match host location goals and objectives for EV charging with our industry-leading equipment acquisition solutions. Our team identifies locations that have the potential to create long-term, recurring value for the Property Partner and Blink. Sales personnel are able to pivot to traditional equipment sales or charging-as-a-service models when, and if, a location is not identified as a promising generator of future recurring revenues. The team strives to maintain a balance between equipment sales that grow revenue today, and site locations that have potential to generate strong revenues in the future under our owner-operator business models.
 
We also engage with strategic distributor and reseller partners across a range of vertical markets both within the U.S. and globally. These organizations typically have unique relationships or capabilities within their respective markets and provide Blink with additional sales opportunities. These partnerships amplify Blink’s sales reach and are authorized to sell our EV charging hardware, software services (connectivity to the Blink Networks), and extended warranty service plans, to strategic customers in specific locations.
 
We are making further inroads into the residential charging station market where we sell Level 2 chargers through various internet channels, such as Amazon, Walmart.com, Lowes.com, and other online retailers, to reach the single-family residential charging market in the United States.
 
During 2022, we were awarded several new prominent customers including Mitsubishi, Cushman & Wakefield, Triple J, Q-Park, Best Buy, UBS, Bosch Mexico, Porsche Puerto Rico and Guatemala, Veris Residential, Greystar, Cambium, and cities of Atlanta, Rockford, Newton, Winslow, Leeds (UK) and others that expand Blink’s potential for unit sales and deployments. Through acquisitions of SemaConnect and Electric Blue in 2022, Blink acquired a number of prominent customers such as Walgreens, Olive Garden, Dunkin Donuts, Kaiser Permanente, Hilton, Ritz-Carlton, and many others. During 2021, we were awarded several prominent customers including General Motors, Ford, Jaguar-Land Rover, Hyundai, Kia, Subaru, AutoNation, Berkshire-Hathaway Automotive, Bridgestone, the City of San Antonio, the Related Group, and others. Commensurate with these new business relationships, we also forged critical strategic relationships with organizations that directly or indirectly influence EV charging station purchase decisions. Examples include Sustainable Westchester in New York, and Clean Cities Organizations in Virginia, Vermont and Ohio, Florida Sheriff’s Association Cooperative, Illinois Region 1 Planning Council, AES El Salvador, and Vizient.

In addition to adding sales personnel within key markets, we solidified our organizational structure through hiring talented business development professionals and establishing a new account management team to onboard customers and maintain long-term relationships.
 
Our in-house staff performs a variety of marketing activities. Our marketing team works to promote and sell our services to property owners and managers, parking companies, and EV drivers. We also utilize marketing and communication channels, including press releases, email marketing, website (www.blinkcharging.com), pay-per-click advertising, social media marketing, webinars, sponsorships and partnerships, advertising, and conferences. Our websites’ information is not, and will not be deemed, a part of this Annual Report or incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC.
 
We continue to invest in improving our company-owned stations’ service and maintenance and those stations with service and maintenance plans and expanding our cloud-based network capabilities. We anticipate continuing to grow our revenues by (i) selling our next generation of EV charging equipment to current as well as to new Property Partners, which includes airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use, municipal locations, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations, and (ii) expanding our sales channels to wholesale distributors, utilities, auto original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), solar integrators, and dealers, which will include implementing EV charging station occupancy fees (after charging is completed, fees for remaining connected to the charging station beyond an allotted grace period), and subscription plans for EV drivers on our company-owned public charging locations.
 
Our Customers and Partners
 
We have strategic partnerships across numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed use and municipal locations, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations. We have hundreds of Property Partners that include well recognized companies, large municipalities, and local businesses. We strive to engage all Blink-owned turnkey and hybrid property partners with exclusive EV charging contracts. This strategy further supports our owner-operator model to generate recurring revenue for both the Property Partner and Blink. Representative examples are McDonald’s, Sony Pictures, Caltrans, Audi of America, Porsche Design Tower, City of Azusa, City of Chula Vista, City of Springfield, City of Tucson, City of Fayetteville, BJ’s Inc., Federal Realty, Fred Meyer Stores, Inc., Fry’s Food & Drug, Inc., Kana Hotel Group, Kroger Company and Ralphs Grocery Company. We continue to establish new contracts with Property Partners that previously secured our services independently or had contracts with the EV services providers that we acquired, including Ecotality, the former owner of the Blink-related assets.
 
Our revenues are primarily derived from fees charged to EV drivers for EV charging in public locations, EV charging hardware sales, government grants, and sales of equipment warranties. EV charging fees to drivers are based on an hourly rate, by energy dispensed per kilowatt-hour (“kWh”), or by session. Such fees are calculated based on various factors, including associated station costs and local electricity tariffs. EV charging hardware is sold to our Property Partners such as InterEnergy, Green Commuter, Nashville Music Center, Wendy’s, and other Property Partners engaged with our host-owned business model. Other income sources from EV charging services are network fees, extended warranty fees, membership fees, and payment processing fees paid by our Property Partners. Blink generates revenues from its ride-sharing program through BlueLA and the City of Los Angeles which allows customers the ability to rent electric vehicles through a subscription service.
 
We teamed up with Google Maps to make locating EV charging stations straightforward and accessible. Our charging stations are displayed in Google Maps, along with other relevant information.
 
We are focused on international expansion and have made significant progress at expanding our business across the globe, focusing primarily on Europe, United Kingdom, Israel, and Latin America.
 
On June 15, 2022, we completed the acquisition of SemaConnect, Inc., a leading provider of EV charging infrastructure solutions in North America with manufacturing facilities in both the United States and India. Upon the closing of the acquisition, SemaConnect became a wholly owned subsidiary of our company, allowing us to comply with “Buy America” mandates and adding nearly 13,000 active chargers and over 150,000 registered users to the Blink Networks. On April 22, 2022, pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated April 22, 2022, we acquired, through our wholly owned subsidiary in the Netherlands, Blink Holdings B.V., all the outstanding capital stock of Electric Blue Limited, a private company limited by shares and registered in England and Wales (“EB”), from its shareholders. Headquartered in St. Albans, United Kingdom, EB is a leading provider of electric vehicle charging and sustainable energy solutions and technologies. On May 10, 2021, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary in the Netherlands, Blink Holdings, B.V., closed on the acquisition of the outstanding capital stock of a Belgian company, Blue Corner NV (“Blue Corner”), from its shareholders. Headquartered in Belgium, with sales representative offices in several other European cities, Blue Corner owns and operates an EV charging network across Europe. The acquisition of Blue Corner was made to enter the European market and provide an opportunity to expand our footprint in this region. Additionally, we operate through Blink Charging Ltd. for our expansion in Israel and Blink Hellas SA for our expansion in Greece.

Our Competition
 
The EV charging equipment and service market is highly competitive, and we expect the market to become increasingly competitive as new entrants enter this growing market. Our products and services compete on product performance and features, the total cost of ownership, sales capabilities, financial stability, brand recognition, product reliability, and the installed base’s size. Our existing competition in the U.S. currently includes ChargePoint, which manufactures EV charging equipment and operates the ChargePoint Network, and Evgo, which offers home and public charging with pay-as-you-go and subscription models. Other entrants into the connected EV charging station equipment market include Volta, Clipper Creek, Wallbox, Freewire, Autel, and EV Connect. We believe these additional competitors struggle with gaining the necessary network traction but could gain momentum in the future. While Tesla does offer EV charging services, the connector type currently restricts the chargers to Tesla vehicles only in North America. Many other EV charging companies offer non-networked or “basic” chargers with limited customer leverage but could provide a low-cost solution for basic charger needs in commercial and home locations.
 
Our competitive advantage in this market includes vertical integration and our exclusive, long-term contracts with our Property Partners and flexible business models. We offer our EV charging station equipment and provide access to a robust EV charging network.
 
Government Grants
 
We have a full-time dedicated team to identify and process federal and state funding opportunities for EV charging infrastructure development. We are committed to pursuing EV charging development grant opportunities in all 50 states. Funding sources in the U.S. include the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Department of Agriculture, the VW mitigation settlement trust fund, funding initiatives from utility service providers and various state and local jurisdictions. In Europe, we have a significant presence both in the European Union and the United Kingdom through our acquisitions of Blue Corner and Electric Blue. Our staff in Europe has significant experience in applying and taking advantage of various European jurisdictions incentives and rebate programs.
Disclosure Related to Climate Change
 
On March 21, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) proposed rules mandating climate-related disclosures in companies’ annual reports and registration statements. The proposed rules contemplate phase-in periods based on SEC filer status, with extended phase-in periods for Scope 3 disclosures and third-party attestation requirements. Under the direction and supervision of senior management and with board oversight, our Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Committee has initiated a process to implement and maintain compliance with the SEC’s climate disclosure requirements as they are enacted.
Privacy and Data Security Laws 
 
We are currently subject, and/or may in the future be subject, to numerous privacy and data security laws. For example, some U.S. states, members of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and many other jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted some form of privacy and data security laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations.
 
The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to a variety of matters, including the control over personal data by individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the documentation we must maintain, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification, and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the European Union (“EU”), provides an enforcement authority, and authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for significant fines. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between Blink Charging and its subsidiaries, including employee information. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to all types of personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management’s attention and increase its cost of doing business, and despite our ongoing efforts to bring its practices into compliance with the GDPR, it may not be successful.
 
Additionally, we are governed by a California state privacy law called the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which contains requirements similar to GDPR for the handling of personal information of California residents. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents. The CCPA includes a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the CCPA), and new ways for such consumers to opt out of certain sales of personal information, and to allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. Further, California voters approved a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) in November 2020. Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding the consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. New legislation proposed or enacted in various other states will continue to shape the data privacy environment nationally. For example, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act became effective on January 1, 2023, the Colorado Privacy Act becomes effective on July 1, 2023, the Connecticut Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring becomes effective on July 1, 2023, and the Utah Privacy Act becomes effective on December 1, 2023.
 
The GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, CPA, and CDPA exemplify the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data. Our compliance costs and potential liability may increase as a result of additional national and international regulatory requirements related to data privacy and data security. We are currently subject, and/or may in the future be subject, to numerous privacy and data security laws. For example, some U.S. states, members of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and many other jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted some form of privacy and data security laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations.
 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
 
We are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers. We believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals, including with respect to ESG. We are focused on further enhancing sustainability of operations and continue to evolve a governance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company. Our board-level ESG Committee, with active management participation, will oversee our ESG initiatives and priorities.
 
Government Regulation and Incentives
 
State, regional and local regulations for installing EV charging stations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may include permitting requirements, inspection requirements, licensing of contractors, and certifications. Compliance with such regulations may cause installation delays.
 
Currently, we apply charging fees by the kWh for our services in most states that permit this policy, while there are a handful of other states that only allow charging fees on hourly and by session for our services (Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Tennessee and Wisconsin).
 
We intend to continue to vigorously seek additional grants, loans, rebates, subsidies, and incentives as cost-effective means of reducing our capital investment in the promotion, purchase and installation of charging stations where applicable. We expect these incentives, rebates, and tax credits to be critical to our future growth. Additionally, some incentives are currently offered to encourage electric vehicle adoption at the federal, state and local levels. The Federal Government provides a personal income tax credit for qualified plug-in electric vehicles, with a maximum of $7,500, depending on vehicle weight and battery capacity, income levels, and battery sourcing origin. We expect Federal Government to continue to provide additional details about the vehicles and customers that qualify for Federal Government incentives. States such as California, Colorado, Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island offer various rebates, grants, and tax credits to incentivize EV and EVSE purchases.

CESQG
 
As a Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator (“CESQG”), we generate a limited quantity of hazardous waste, mainly solvent contaminated wipes, which are transported to local solid waste facilities. Scrapped electronic boards are transported to a local recycler. A CESQG of hazardous waste is defined as a generator that:

● | produces no more than 100 kg (220 lbs.) of hazardous waste per calendar month; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | produces no more than 1 kg (2.2 lbs.) of acute hazardous waste per calendar month; 
● | never accumulates more than 1,000 kg (2,204 lbs.) of hazardous waste at any one time; and 
● | Never accumulates more than 1 kg (2.2 lbs.) of acute hazardous waste at any one time. 

 
The use of our machinery and equipment must comply with the following applicable laws and regulations, including safety and environmental regulations:
 

● | General Safety for All Employees – Includes health hazard communication, emergency exit plans, electrical safety-related work practices, office safety, and hand-powered tools. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Technicians and Engineers – Only authorized persons (technicians and engineers) perform product testing and repair in the facility’s production and engineering areas, including those engineers involved in field service work. Regulations include control of hazardous energy and personal protective equipment. 
● | Logisticians – Includes forklift operations performed only by certified shipping/receiving personnel and material handling and storage. 

 
We fully comply with the general industry category’s environmental regulations applicable to us as a CESQG.
 
OSHA
 
We are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended (“OSHA”). OSHA establishes specific employer responsibilities, including maintaining a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and various recordkeeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Multiple standards, including standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to our operations. We are in full compliance with OSHA regulations.
NEMA
 
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (“NEMA”) is the association of electrical equipment and medical imaging manufacturers. NEMA provides a forum for developing technical standards in the industry and users’ best interests, advocating industry policies on legislative and regulatory matters, and collecting, analyzing, and disseminating industry data. All of our US products comply with the NEMA standards that apply to such products.
Waste Handling and Disposal
 
We are subject to laws and regulations regarding the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and solid wastes, including electronic wastes and batteries. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and may impose strict, joint, and several liability for the investigation and remediation of areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, in the United States and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred as well as companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environmental and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
 
We also generate solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain components of our products are excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations, provided certain requirements are met. However, if these components do not meet all of the established requirements for the exclusion, or if the requirements for the exclusion change, we may be required to treat such products as hazardous waste, which are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Any such changes in the laws and regulations, or our ability to qualify the materials it uses for exclusions under such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our operating expenses.
 
Similar laws exist in other jurisdictions where we operate. Additionally, in the EU, we are subject to the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (“WEEE Directive”). The WEEE Directive provides for the creation of a collection scheme where consumers return waste electrical and electronic equipment to merchants, such as Blink Charging. If we fail to properly manage such waste electrical and electronic equipment, it may be subject to fines, sanctions, or other actions that may adversely affect on our financial operations.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. Our success depends partly on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had four active patents issued in the United States (in the name of our subsidiary Ecotality, Inc.). These patents relate to various EV charging station designs. We intend to regularly assess opportunities for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs and methodologies that we believe provide a meaningful competitive advantage. If we cannot do so, our ability to protect our intellectual property or prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights may be impaired.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
Our experienced employees and management team are some of our most valuable resources, and we are committed to attracting, motivating, and retaining top talent. As of December 31, 2022, we had 620 employees, including 564 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
Our success is directly related to the satisfaction, growth, and development of our employees. We strive to offer a work environment where employee opinions are valued and allow our employees to use and augment their professional skills. To achieve our human capital goals, we intend to remain focused on providing our personnel with entrepreneurial opportunities to expand our business within their areas of expertise and continue to provide our personnel with personal and professional growth. We emphasize several measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including, among others, employee safety and wellness, talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement, development and training, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity.

COVID-19 and Employee Safety and Wellness. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. These measures include allowing most employees to work from home and implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. We believe in supporting our employees’ health and well-being. Our goal is to help employees make informed decisions about their health by providing the tools and resources necessary to achieve a healthier lifestyle. We offer our employees a wide array of benefits such as life and health (medical, dental, and vision) insurance, paid time off and retirement benefits, as well as emotional well-being services through our health insurance program.
 
Diversity and Inclusion and Ethical Business Practices. We believe that a company culture focused on diversity and inclusion is a crucial driver of creativity and innovation. We also believe that diverse and inclusive teams make better business decisions, ultimately driving better business outcomes. We are committed to recruiting, retaining, and developing high-performing, innovative and engaged employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences. This commitment includes providing equal access to, and participation in, equal employment opportunities, programs, and services without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, stereotypes, or assumptions based thereon. We welcome and celebrate our teams’ differences, experiences, and beliefs, and we are investing in a more engaged, diverse, and inclusive workforce.
 
We also foster a strong corporate culture that promotes high standards of ethics and compliance for our business, including policies that set forth principles to guide employee, officer, director, and vendor conduct, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We also maintain a whistleblower policy and anonymous hotline for the confidential reporting of any suspected policy violations or unethical business conduct on the part of our businesses, employees, officers, directors, or vendors.
