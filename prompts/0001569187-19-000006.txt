Our Company

References to “we,” “our,” “us,” and “our company” refer to Armada Hoffler Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, including Armada Hoffler, L.P., a Virginia limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), of which we are the sole general partner.

We are a full-service real estate company with extensive experience developing, building, owning, and managing high-quality, institutional-grade office, retail, and multifamily properties in attractive markets primarily throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States. In addition to the ownership of our operating property portfolio, we develop and build properties for our own account and through joint ventures between us and unaffiliated partners and also invest in development projects through mezzanine lending arrangements. We also provide general contracting services to third parties. Our construction and development experience includes mid- and high-rise office buildings, retail strip malls and retail power centers, multifamily apartment communities, hotels and conference centers, single- and multi-tenant industrial, distribution, and manufacturing facilities, educational, medical and special purpose facilities, government projects, parking garages, and mixed-use town centers. Our third-party construction contracts have included signature properties across the Mid-Atlantic region, such as the Inner Harbor East development in Baltimore, Maryland, including the Four Seasons Hotel and Legg Mason office tower, the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Washington, D.C., and a $50.0 million proton therapy institute for Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia. Our construction company historically has been ranked among the “Top 400 General Contractors” nationwide by Engineering News Record and has been ranked among the “Top 50 Retail Contractors” by Shopping Center World.

We were formed on October 12, 2012 under the laws of the State of Maryland and are headquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia. We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, our Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2018, we owned, through a combination of direct and indirect interests, 74.5% of the units of limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership (“OP Units”).

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that we distinguish ourselves from other REITs through the following competitive strengths:


• | High-Quality, Diversified Portfolio. Our portfolio consists of institutional-grade, premier office, retail, and multifamily properties located primarily in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Our properties are generally in the top tier of commercial properties in their markets and offer Class-A amenities and finishes.


• | Seasoned, Committed and Aligned Senior Management Team with a Proven Track Record. Our senior management team has extensive experience developing, constructing, owning, operating, renovating, and financing institutional-grade office, retail, multifamily, and hotel properties in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions. As of December 31, 2018, our named executive officers and directors collectively

2

owned approximately 15% of our company on a fully diluted basis, which we believe aligns their interests with those of our stockholders. 

• | Strategic Focus on Attractive Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern Markets. We focus our activities in our target markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States that demonstrate attractive fundamentals driven by favorable supply and demand characteristics and limited competition from other large, well-capitalized operators. We believe that our longstanding presence in our target markets provides us with significant advantages in sourcing and executing development opportunities, identifying and mitigating potential risks, and negotiating attractive pricing.


• | Extensive Experience with Construction and Development. Our platform consists of development, construction, and asset management capabilities, which comprise an integrated delivery system for every project that we build for our own account or for third-party clients. This integrated approach provides a single source of accountability for design and construction, simplifies coordination and communication among the relevant stakeholders in each project and provides us valuable insight from an operational perspective. We believe that being regularly engaged in construction and development projects provides us significant and distinct advantages, including enhanced market intelligence, greater insight into best practices, enhanced operating leverage, and “first look” access to development and ownership opportunities in our target markets. We also use mezzanine lending arrangements, which may enable us to acquire completed development projects at prices that are below market or at cost and may enable us to realize greater profit in the development process.


• | Longstanding Public and Private Relationships. We have extensive experience with public/private real estate development projects dating back to 1984, having worked with the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Georgia, and the Kingdom of Sweden, as well as various municipalities. Through our experience and longstanding relationships with governmental entities such as these, we have learned to successfully navigate the often complex and time-consuming government approval process, which has given us the ability to capture opportunities that we believe many of our competitors are unable to pursue.

Our Business and Growth Strategies

Our primary business objectives are to: (i) continue to develop, build and own institutional-grade office, retail, and multifamily properties in our target markets, (ii) finance and operate our portfolio in a manner that increases cash flow and property values, (iii) execute new third-party construction work with consistent operating margins, and (iv) pursue selective acquisition opportunities, particularly when the acquisition involves a significant redevelopment aspect. We will seek to achieve our objectives through the following strategies: 

• | Pursue a Disciplined, Opportunistic Development and Acquisition Strategy Focused on Office, Retail, and Multifamily Properties. We intend to continue to grow our asset base through continued strategic development of office, retail, and multifamily properties, and the selective acquisition of high-quality properties that are well-located in their submarkets. Furthermore, we believe our construction and development expertise provides a high level of quality control while ensuring that the projects we construct and develop are completed more quickly and at a lower cost than if we engaged a third-party general contractor.


• | Pursue New, and Expand Existing, Public/Private Relationships. We intend to continue to leverage our extensive experience in completing large, complex, mixed-use, public/private projects to establish relationships with new public partners while expanding our relationships with existing public partners.


• | Leverage our Construction and Development Platform to Attract Additional Third-Party Clients. We believe that we have a unique advantage over many of our competitors due to our integrated construction and development business that provides expertise, oversight, and a broad array of client-focused services. We intend to continue to conduct and grow our construction business and other third-party services by pursuing new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients. We also intend to continue to use our mezzanine lending program to leverage our development and construction expertise in serving clients.


• | Engage in Disciplined Capital Recycling. We intend to opportunistically divest properties when we believe returns have been maximized and to redeploy the capital into new development, acquisition, repositioning, or redevelopment projects that are expected to generate higher potential risk-adjusted returns.

(1) | The net rentable square footage for each of our office and retail properties is the sum of (a) the square footage of existing leases, plus (b) for available space, management’s estimate of net rentable square footage based, in part, on past leases. The net rentable square footage included in office leases is generally consistent with the Building Owners and Managers Association 1996 measurement guidelines.


(2) | Occupancy for each of our office and retail properties is calculated as (a) square footage under executed leases as of December 31, 2018 divided by (b) net rentable square feet, expressed as a percentage. Occupancy for our multifamily properties is calculated as (a) total units occupied as of December 31, 2018 divided by (b) total units available, expressed as a percentage.


(3) | For the properties in our office and retail portfolios, annualized base rent ("ABR") is calculated by multiplying (a) monthly base rent (defined as cash base rent, before contractual tenant concessions and abatements, and excluding tenant reimbursements for expenses paid by us) as of December 31, 2018 for in-place leases as of such date by (b) 12, and does not give effect to periodic contractual rent increases or contingent rental revenue (e.g., percentage rent based on tenant sales thresholds). ABR per leased square foot is calculated by dividing (a) ABR by (b) square footage under in-place leases as of December 31, 2018. In the case of triple net or modified gross leases, our calculation of ABR does not include tenant reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, common area or other operating expenses.


(4) | As of December 31, 2018, we occupied 41,103 square feet at these two properties at an ABR of $1.3 million, or $31.21 per leased square foot, which amounts are reflected in this table. The rent paid by us is eliminated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").


(5) | Includes ABR pursuant to a rooftop lease.

(7) | We are entitled to a preferred return of 8% and 9% on our investment in Brooks Crossing and Lightfoot Marketplace, respectively.


(8) | For the properties in our multifamily portfolio, ABR is calculated by multiplying (a) base rental payments for the month ended December 31, 2018 by (b) 12.


(9) | Monthly rent per occupied unit/bed is calculated by dividing total base rental payments for the month ended December 31, 2018 by the number of occupied units (or, in the case of Johns Hopkins Village, occupied beds of the 568 total beds) as of December 31, 2018.


(10) | The ABR for Liberty, Cosmopolitan, and John Hopkins Village excludes $0.3 million, $0.7 million, and $1.2 million from ground floor retail leases, respectively.

1405 Point

On October 15, 2015, we entered into a note receivable with a maximum principal balance of $28.2 million for the 1405 Point project in the Harbor Point area of Baltimore, Maryland (also known as Point Street Apartments). On November 11, 2018, this loan was modified to increase the maximum principal amount of the loan to $31.0 million. Interest on this loan accrues at a rate of 8.0% per annum. 1405 Point is a development project for a 17-story building comprised of 289 residential units and 18,000 square feet of street-level retail space. Beatty Development Group (“BDG”) is the developer of the project and has engaged us to serve as construction general contractor. 1405 Point opened during the first quarter of 2018 and is subject to a ground lease from an affiliate of BDG.

BDG secured a senior construction loan of up to $67.0 million to fund the development and construction of 1405 Point on November 10, 2016. We have agreed to guarantee $25.0 million of the senior construction loan. We have options to purchase up to a 100% interest in 1405 Point upon completion of the project as follows: (i) an option to purchase a 79% indirect interest in Point Street Apartments for $27.6 million, exercisable within one year from the project’s completion (the “First Option”) and (ii) provided that we have exercised the First Option, an option to purchase an additional 21% interest in Point Street Apartments prior to July 31, 2020 (the “Second Option”) in exchange for increased payments under the ground lease. The BDG mezzanine loan matures on the earliest of (i) November 1, 2019, which may be extended by BDG under a one-year extension option, (ii) the maturity date or earlier termination of the senior construction loan, or (iii) the date we exercise the Second Option.
We plan to exercise the First Option during the first quarter of 2019. We currently have a $2.1 million letter of credit for the guarantee of the senior construction loan.

As of December 31, 2018, the balance of the BDG loan was $30.2 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $2.1 million of interest income on the BDG loan. See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

On April 21, 2016, we entered into a note receivable with a maximum principal balance of $48.1 million in the residential component of the Annapolis Junction Town Center project in Maryland (“Annapolis Junction”). Annapolis Junction is an apartment development project with 416 residential units. It is part of a mixed-use development project that is also planned to have 17,000 square feet of retail space and a 150-room hotel. Annapolis Junction Apartments Owner, LLC (“AJAO”) is the developer of the residential component and engaged us to serve as construction general contractor for the residential component. Annapolis Junction opened during 2017 and 2018 and is currently in lease-up.

Interest on the AJAO loan accrues at 10.0% per annum. On November 16, 2018, AJAO refinanced the senior construction loan with a one year senior loan of $83.0 million, which matures on November 16, 2019. This senior loan may be extended for one additional year if certain minimum debt yields and minimum debt service coverage ratios are met by AJAO. We have agreed to guarantee $8.3 million of the senior loan, and the AJAO loan will mature concurrent with the new senior loan. In conjunction with this refinancing, we sold the First Option and Second Option to AJAO for a price of $5.0 million, which is being recognized as interest income over the remaining term of the loan. Additionally, AJAO repaid $11.1 million of the outstanding mezzanine loan balance as part of this refinancing.

We agreed to guarantee 50% of the senior construction loan in exchange for the option to purchase the property upon completion according to a predetermined formula primarily dependent upon the developer's leasing activities and the extent to which the developer elects to complete all or a portion of the total planned space, if applicable, in response to leasing activities.

Tax Status

We have elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Our continued qualification as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels, and the diversity of ownership of our capital stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and that our manner of operation will enable us to maintain the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we have elected to treat AHP Holding, Inc., which, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, operate our construction, development, and third-party asset management businesses, as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”).

As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. Under the Code, REITs are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that they distribute each year at least 90% of their REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to state and local taxes on our income and assets and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. Additionally, any income earned by our services company, and any other TRS we form in the future, will be fully subject to federal, state and local corporate income tax.
Insurance

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption, and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket insurance policy in addition to other coverage that may be appropriate for certain of our properties. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate for our properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, and industry practice; however, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover our losses. We do not carry insurance for certain losses, including, but not limited to, losses caused by riots or war. Some of our policies, such as those covering losses due to terrorism and earthquakes, are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses for such events. In addition, all but two of the properties in our portfolio as of December 31, 2018 were located in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, which are areas subject to an increased risk of hurricanes. While we will carry hurricane insurance on certain of our properties, the amount of our hurricane insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover losses from hurricanes. We may reduce or discontinue hurricane, terrorism, or other insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any of these policies exceeds, in our judgment, the value of the coverage

discounted for the risk of loss. Also, if destroyed, we may not be able to rebuild certain of our properties due to current zoning and land use regulations. As a result, we may incur significant costs in the event of adverse weather conditions and natural disasters. In addition, our title insurance policies may not insure for the current aggregate market value of our portfolio, and we do not intend to increase our title insurance coverage as the market value of our portfolio increases. If we or one or more of our tenants experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable costs in the future as the costs associated with property and casualty renewals may be higher than anticipated. 

Regulation

General

Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances, and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of the properties in our portfolio has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.
Americans With Disabilities Act

Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”), to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. Although we believe that the properties in our portfolio in the aggregate substantially comply with present requirements of the ADA, we have not conducted a comprehensive audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance, and we are aware that some particular properties may currently be in non-compliance with the ADA. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the incurrence of additional costs to attain compliance, the imposition of fines, an award of damages to private litigants, and a limitation on our ability to refinance outstanding indebtedness. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Environmental Matters

Under various federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste, or petroleum products at, on, in, under, or migrating from such property, including costs to investigate and clean up such contamination and liability for harm to natural resources. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. These liabilities could be substantial, and the cost of any required remediation, removal, fines, or other costs could exceed the value of the property and our aggregate assets. In addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability for costs of remediation and personal or property damage or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, or develop our properties or to borrow using the properties as collateral. In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures.

Some of our properties contain, have contained, or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products, propane, or other hazardous or toxic substances. Similarly, some of our properties were used in the past for commercial or industrial purposes, or are currently used for commercial purposes, that involve or involved the use of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or are adjacent to or near properties that have been or are used for similar commercial or industrial purposes. As a result, some of our properties have been or may be impacted by contamination arising from the releases of such hazardous substances or petroleum products. Where we have deemed appropriate, we have taken steps to address identified contamination or mitigate risks associated with such contamination; however, we are unable to ensure that further actions will not be necessary. As a result of the foregoing, we could potentially incur material liability.

Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos-containing building materials, or ACBM, and may impose fines and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements or expose us to third-party liability. Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing ACBM (and employers in such buildings) properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately notify or train those who may come into contact with asbestos, and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. In addition, the presence of ACBM in our properties may expose us to third-party liability (e.g. liability for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos). We are not presently aware of any material adverse issues at our properties including ACBM.

Similarly, environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of lead-based paint in residential buildings, and may impose fines and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. Such laws require, among other things, that owners or operators of residential facilities that contain or potentially contain lead-based paint notify residents of the presence or potential presence of lead-based paint prior to occupancy and prior to renovations and manage lead-based paint waste appropriately. In addition, the presence of lead-based paint in our buildings may expose us to third-party liability (e.g., liability for personal injury associated with exposure to lead-based paint). We are not presently aware of any material adverse issues at our properties involving lead-based paint.

In addition, the properties in our portfolio also are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental and health and safety requirements, such as state and local fire requirements. Moreover, some of our tenants may handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties, which are subject to regulation. Such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject us or our tenants to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental liabilities could affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us. In addition, changes in laws could increase the potential liability for noncompliance. Our leases sometimes require our tenants to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities. However, in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of any of our tenants to satisfy such obligations, we may be required to satisfy such obligations. In addition, we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims regardless of whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or waste and irrespective of tenant lease provisions. The costs associated with such liability could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us.
When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses, and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants, or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. We are not presently aware of any material adverse indoor air quality issues at our properties.

Competition

We compete with a number of developers, owners, and operators of office, retail, and multifamily real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located and some of which have greater financial resources than we do. In operating and managing our portfolio, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors, including location, rental rates, security, flexibility, and expertise to design space to meet prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated, maintained, and marketed. As leases at our properties expire, we may encounter significant competition to renew or re-lease space in light of the large number of competing properties within the markets in which we operate. As a result, we may be required to provide rent concessions or abatements, incur charges for tenant improvements and other inducements, including early termination rights or below-market renewal options, or we may not be able to timely lease vacant space.

We also face competition when pursuing development, acquisition, and lending opportunities. Our competitors may be able to pay higher property acquisition prices, may have private access to opportunities not available to us, may have more financial resources than we do, and may otherwise be in a better position to acquire or develop a property. Competition may also have the effect of reducing the number of suitable development and acquisition opportunities available to us or increasing the price required to consummate a development or acquisition opportunity.

In addition, we face competition in our construction business from other construction companies in the markets in which we operate, including small local companies and large regional and national companies. In our construction business, we compete for construction projects based on several factors, including cost, reputation for quality and timeliness, access to machinery and equipment, access to and relationships with high-quality subcontractors, financial strength, knowledge of local markets, and project management abilities. We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the foregoing factors and that our construction business is well-positioned to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate. However, some of the construction companies with which we compete have different cost structures and greater financial and other resources than we do, which may put them at an advantage when competing with us for construction projects. Competition from other construction companies may reduce the number of construction projects that we are hired to complete and increase pricing pressure, either of which could reduce the profitability of our construction business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 156 employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
