Overview
 We are an immuno-oncology company developing tumor-specific cancer immunotherapies to fight multiple cancer types. Our approach harnesses the natural power of a patient’s own immune system to recognize short tumor-specific peptide sequences presented on cancer cells, referred to as tumor-specific neoantigens, or TSNA, in order to destroy tumor cells. We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our first personalized immunotherapy product candidate, GRANITE-001, in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the treatment of multiple common solid tumors. Our tumor-specific immunotherapy treatment is built on two key pillars—first, our proprietary Gritstone EDGETM platform, which gives us a superior ability to predict, from a routine tumor biopsy, the TSNA that are presented on a patient’s tumor cells; and second, our ability to develop and manufacture a potent immunotherapy utilizing patients’ TSNA to drive the patient’s immune system to attack and destroy tumors. Our tumor-specific immunotherapy portfolio consists of our personalized immunotherapy product candidate, GRANITE-001, which is manufactured uniquely for each patient, and our off-the-shelf immunotherapy product candidate series, SLATE, which is designed for selected subsets of patients with common tumor neoantigens. We have also recently initiated lead optimization of a separate product class of bispecific antibodies, or BiSAb, which offers an alternative approach to off-the-shelf therapy against our EDGETM - identified novel tumor-specific antigens. Our tumor-specific immunotherapy candidates are designed to fit easily into a community oncology setting and to be administered in earlier lines of treatment, in combination with checkpoint inhibitors to further drive a robust T cell response, rather than only in refractory or relapsed cancers. 
 Immuno-oncology represents one of the most significant advances in the history of cancer treatment. In 2014, the first checkpoint inhibitor was approved and today, despite only a modest breadth of efficacy across patients, this class of therapies is predicted to reach over $32.0 billion in combined global sales by 2022. However, because checkpoint inhibitors work through relatively non-specific stimulation of occasional, pre-existing, tumor-specific T cells, they are effective in only a subset of patients, with objective responses (substantial tumor shrinkage) observed in 0-20% of all patients with cancer of the lung, breast, prostate, colon/rectum and ovary (the major lethal solid tumor types). Many patients appear not to possess meaningful numbers of T cells that recognize their tumor (so-called “cold” tumors). We believe the path to broader immuno-oncology efficacy and more meaningful clinical responses resides in the de novo generation of new, potent, tumor-specific T cell responses. 
 The first pillar of our tumor-specific cancer immunotherapy approach is our understanding of TSNA and the application of our artificial intelligence based, proprietary Gritstone EDGE platform to predict the presence of a patient’s unique TSNA on tumor cells. While there are frequently hundreds of mutations in the DNA of a tumor cell, only approximately 1% of these mutations are actually transcribed, translated and processed into a unique “non-self” peptide sequence that is presented on the surface of tumor cells and can therefore be recognized by the patient’s own T cells. Furthermore, these rare TSNA are almost all unique to each individual patient’s tumor. Current technologies cannot predict the presence of TSNA with sufficient accuracy to design a therapy that is likely to be effective. The Gritstone EDGE platform consists of proprietary machine learning models that use DNA/RNA sequence data derived from a patient’s tumor biopsy to predict which mutations will generate TSNA most likely to be presented on the tumor cell surface. Applying our EDGE platform to sequence data from human tumors, we have shown a nine-fold improvement in the accuracy of prediction with our platform compared to publicly available approaches. 
 The second pillar of our tumor-specific cancer immunotherapy approach is our ability to develop and manufacture a patient-specific therapeutic to direct a robust T cell response to those TSNA predicted to be presented on the patient’s tumor. Our tumor-specific immunotherapy candidates, GRANITE-001 and SLATE-001, comprise a sequential immunization of a viral prime and RNA boosts delivered by intramuscular injection, which we refer to as our heterologous prime-boost. In our GRANITE-001 product candidate each of the viral prime and RNA boost immunizations contain a patient-specific set of predicted TSNA, whereas the viral prime and RNA boost in our SLATE product candidate series contains a fixed TSNA cassette that is designed for the subset of patients who carry these antigens. Grounded in traditional infectious disease vaccine immunology, this two-step immunization utilizes a prime and a boost to educate the patient’s T cells to detect TSNA and destroy tumor cells. In non-human primate models, we have demonstrated a profound and specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell response to antigens administered in this way.

Our personalized immunotherapy process begins with a routine tumor biopsy from the patient. We utilize our in-house sequencing capabilities on the tumor sample and then apply our proprietary EDGE platform to derive a set of predicted TSNA likely to be presented on the patient’s tumor. Using these TSNA, we design a highly potent personalized immunotherapy candidate containing the relevant neoantigens to be administered by simple intramuscular injection. We have designed each of our tumor-specific immunotherapy candidates such that oncologists will not have to alter their treatment practices, and we believe this will extend the utility of our medicines into the community oncology setting and not limit their use to scarce centers of excellence. We believe that as a result of its design, our tumor-specific immunotherapy candidate has the potential to expand the efficacy of immunotherapy into broader patient populations. 
 We initiated a first-in-human Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our first personalized immunotherapy product candidate, GRANITE-001, in the fourth quarter of 2018, evaluating it in the treatment of common solid tumors, including metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and gastroesophageal, bladder and microsatellite stable, or MSS, colorectal cancers, in each case in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. We dosed our first patient in the first quarter of 2019. The Phase 1 portion of our Phase 1/2 trial will seek to establish a dose for further investigation in Phase 2 and to evaluate safety, tolerability and, importantly, immunogenicity of our lead product candidate. We will seek to further evaluate efficacy and safety in the Phase 2 cohort expansion portion in several common solid tumor types. In July 2018, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GRANITE-001 in combination with OPDIVO (nivolumab) and in combination with OPDIVO plus YERVOY (ipilimumab), in patients with advanced solid tumors. 
 We will follow the initiation of our personalized clinical program with a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of SLATE-001, our first off-the-shelf, TSNA-directed immunotherapy product candidate in the second half of 2019. SLATE-001 utilizes the same heterologous prime-boost approach as GRANITE-001 but contains a fixed cassette with TSNA that are shared across a subset of cancer patients rather than a cassette unique to an individual patient, providing us with an off-the-shelf alternative to our personalized manufactured product, GRANITE-001. SLATE-001 has the benefit of being readily available for rapid initiation of therapy, and is less expensive to manufacture than a personalized product. Early analyses suggest that while each such shared neoantigen may only be found in less than 2% of patients with a particular tumor type, our heterologous prime-boost can contain at least 20 of these TSNA, which we believe will result in the off-the-shelf product having an addressable population of approximately 10-15% of patients within common solid tumor types such as colorectal cancer and lung cancer. Our off-the-shelf product candidates are specific to a particular tumor type, and the TSNA module is fixed for each product. As a result, the essential aspect to the utilization of the off-shelf-product candidate is the ability to accurately identify patients whose tumors contain at least one of the TSNA represented within the off-the-shelf product candidate. Today, this can be simply achieved by screening the patient’s tumor using commercially-available genomic screens and identifying the patient’s HLA type from blood with a standard clinical assay. 
 We are also leveraging our expertise in cancer genomics and our tumor antigen discovery platform to identify novel peptide sequences (not mutated) that may be shared across common tumor types (tumor-specific shared antigens), which we believe are likely to have value as targets to direct T cells onto tumors specifically. Shared antigen targets enable us to opportunistically partner or develop additional therapeutic approaches to redirect T cells onto tumors using these highly specific targets. Additional approaches include modifying the receptors of the patient’s own T cells to help them recognize tumor targets (adoptive T cell therapy) and/or using small adapter proteins that have two recognition arms—one for tumors and one for T cells (bispecific antibodies). In August 2018, we announced our first collaboration supporting this strategy with bluebird bio, Inc., or bluebird bio, whereby we will identify up to ten tumor-specific targets and associated T cell receptors for therapeutic application within bluebird bio’s cell therapy platform. 
 The ability to control the manufacturing of a high-quality tumor-specific immunotherapy products, and scale production if early data are positive, is critical for efficient clinical development and commercialization. We have invested significant resources in our Cambridge, Massachusetts sequencing lab and our Pleasanton, California manufacturing facility to address these needs and position ourselves to control the critical steps in the production of our tumor-specific immunotherapy candidates. 
 To deliver on the promise of our novel therapeutic approach, we have assembled a highly experienced management team with focused expertise in each of our core disciplines of cancer genomics, immunology and vaccinology, clinical development, regulatory, and biomanufacturing from several leading biotechnology companies, including Clovis Oncology, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Genentech, Inc. and Foundation Medicine, Inc. Our co-founder Dr. Andrew Allen brings experience as a co-founder and Chief Medical Officer of Clovis Oncology, Inc., with prior experience in various leadership roles at Pharmion Corporation and Chiron Corporation, where he worked on Proleukin (IL-2), the first cancer immunotherapy. The scientific advisory board includes selected experts in relevant disciplines, including Dr. Timothy Chan (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) and Dr. Naiyer Rizvi (Columbia University Medical Center) who together first demonstrated that TSNA are key T cell targets in cancer patients responding to checkpoint inhibitor therapy, as well as Dr. James Gulley (National Cancer Institute) who is an international expert in cancer immunotherapy with a focus on vaccines.

Our Strategy
 We have assembled a team of industry leaders, each possessing specific expertise that allows us to build and deploy our proprietary EDGE platform to predict tumor-specific T cell targets and deliver personalized cancer immunotherapies to patients. Our goal is to eradicate cancer by initially developing personalized immunotherapies that focus on the unique and individual nature of a patient’s tumor. Our strategy to achieve this includes the following key components: 

• | Rapidly advance GRANITE-001, our lead product candidate, in multiple clinical settings, with the objective of generating a significant CD8+ T cell response to tumor-specific neoantigens. GRANITE-001 is our first personalized immunotherapy product candidate. It is engineered to elicit a significant T cell response to selected antigens in humans (particularly CD8+ T cell responses) based upon extensive clinical experience with many different vectors in the realm of infectious disease. We have studied these clinical data closely and applied key learnings to the design and development of our immunotherapy platform. Our investigational new drug application, or IND for GRANITE-001 was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in September 2018, and we initiated a first-in-human Phase 1/2 trial of our heterologous prime-boost regimen in combination with checkpoint inhibitors provided by our collaborator BMS. We dosed our first patient in the first quarter of 2019. Upon completion of the Phase 1 portion of the trial, we intend to demonstrate proof of concept in the Phase 2 portion of the trial, which will consist of single-arm cohort expansions in “cold” tumors (such as MSS colorectal cancer) where checkpoint inhibitors alone have very low efficacy, and in randomized cohorts in typically more inflamed tumors (such as lung, gastric or bladder cancer), where checkpoint inhibitors are known to have some activity but recurrence remains expected.

• | Invest in our Gritstone EDGE platform and maximize its utility across modalities. Using contemporary sequencing and machine learning approaches, we have developed our EDGE platform to accurately predict the antigenic landscape of a tumor that allows for its select targeting with personalized immunotherapy. The EDGE platform utilizes proprietary machine learning models and an extensive dataset of over a million HLA-presented peptides from over 300 human tumor and matched normal tissue specimens. We are initially applying the platform to develop multiple formats of personalized cancer immunotherapy candidates—including our heterologous prime-boost immunization containing TSNA (our lead program) as well as “off-the-shelf” therapies targeting shared tumor-specific antigens—in order to maximize the utility of our prediction capabilities across modalities. We intend to continually make investments to improve the EDGE platform’s prediction capabilities in order to develop more efficacious medicines. Genomic and immune response data from our clinical trials will serve to further validate and refine our machine learning platform.

• | Build upon the discoveries from our Gritstone EDGE platform to rapidly move SLATE-001 and other shared tumor-specific antigen product candidates, into multiple clinical settings where shared (neo)antigens may have utility. For SLATE-001, this includes—but will not be limited to—KRAS-driven tumors such as colorectal cancer, pancreatic ductal carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung. We plan to submit IND documentation for SLATE-001 in mid-2019 and start Phase 1/2 clinical trials in mid-2019. For BiSAb against shared tumor-specific antigens, we expect to nominate a development candidate in the second half of 2019 to enter IND-enabling studies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to build our in-house manufacturing capabilities to maintain the highest controls on quality and capacity. We believe the speed, quality, reliability and scalability of our manufacturing capabilities will be a core competitive advantage to our clinical development and commercial success, and we have invested extensively in building our own manufacturing facilities. We intend to internalize the majority of the manufacturing steps to drive down both cost and production time, as well as establish full control over intellectual property and product quality. We believe that operating our own manufacturing facility will provide us with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, will enable the more rapid implementation of process changes, and will allow for better long-term manufacturing cost control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Move tumor-specific immunotherapy into community oncology settings and earlier lines of treatment. We are designing our tumor-specific immunotherapy product candidates to fit into a community oncology setting, where the vast majority of cancer patients are treated. We start with routine tumor biopsies, employ our EDGE platform to create a personalized immunotherapy, and administer it as an intramuscular injection. This approach is designed to enable oncologists to integrate our tumor-specific immunotherapy product candidates into their treatment practices without requiring a change in the current treatment paradigm. We believe this strategy has the potential to extend the use of our medicines into the community setting, enabling rapid trial execution, and expanding commercial use beyond limited centers of research excellence. Additionally, we intend to develop our tumor-specific immunotherapy product candidates in earlier lines of treatment, where recent clinical data with other forms of immunotherapy suggest efficacy is likely to be stronger, versus being only used in highly refractory or late-stage cancer patients. This intention is enabled by new liquid biopsy techniques whereby the reliable detection of minute amounts of tumor-derived DNA in blood can be used both to stratify patients (identify those at high risk of disease recurrence or progression even if imaging data suggests eradication of disease) and to offer a surrogate endpoint for more rapid assessment of therapeutic efficacy versus traditional clinical endpoints.

• | Enter into collaborations to realize the full potential of our platform. The breadth of our EDGE platform enables its application to a variety of therapeutic formats, including cell therapy, bispecific antibodies and other areas where shared tumor (neo)antigens could be impactful to cancer treatment. We intend to form collaborations around certain aspects of our platform, such as shared tumor antigens, as we believe we will benefit from the resources and capabilities of other organizations in the manufacture, development and commercialization of such diverse immunotherapies. Aligned with this strategy, our strategic collaboration with bluebird bio involves use of our EDGE platform to identify tumor-specific targets and associated T cell receptors for clinical application within bluebird bio’s cell therapy platform.

 Immuno-Oncology and Tumor-Specific Neoantigens
 Immuno-oncology is an emerging field of cancer therapy that aims to activate the immune system to enhance and/or create anti-cancer immune responses, as well as to overcome the immuno-suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells have developed against the immune system. It is now well established that the immune system can, on occasion, successfully eliminate all tumor cells, leading to long-term benefit, even cures, in some patients with solid tumors. The primary challenge in immuno-oncology is to extend this useful biology to many more cancer patients, and to do so earlier in the treatment paradigm. Understanding which cells of the immune system are critical, what they recognize on tumor cells, and why they are typically absent or ineffective in cancer patients is core to overcoming this challenge. T cells are the vital foot soldiers in the immune attack upon cancer cells. T cells have evolved to recognize “foreign” markers on cells infected by viruses, and DNA mutations, which are a hallmark of cancer, often lead to the generation of such “foreign” markers, which are different from normal or “wild-type” proteins. Exploitation of this cancer cell vulnerability using new biological and computational tools lies at the heart of our lead program. 
 Critical Importance of T Cells 
 The most critical components of the immune response to tumors are T cells, white blood cells which mature in the thymus gland. T cells can be classified into two major subsets, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, based on expression of CD4 or CD8 markers on the surface of the T cell. CD4+ T cells (also referred to as helper T cells) provide help to the immune response by secreting cytokines that enhance the activation, expansion, migration and effector functions of other types of immune cells. CD8+ T cells (also referred to as cytotoxic or “killer” T cells) can directly attack and kill cells they recognize as abnormal. An activated CD8+ T cell attacks and kills a target cell when the T cell encounters its target and the T cell receptor, or TCR, recognizes and binds to a specific protein complex on the target cell. This protein complex is comprised of a short peptide (fragment of a protein) bound to a platform molecule called, in humans, the human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, complex. This HLA/peptide complex is the antigen recognized by a T cell receptor. 
 One of the primary functions of T cells is to detect and eliminate normal cells that have been infected by a virus. To accomplish this, T cells are “trained” in the thymus early in life to differentiate between HLA/peptide complexes that are “self” derived (an HLA presenting a peptide derived from a normal self-protein) and those that are “foreign” or “non-self” (an HLA presenting a peptide derived from a non-self-protein such as a viral protein). When the immune system develops early in life, T cells that recognize self peptides are eliminated in the thymus to avoid the risk of an auto-immune reaction, in a process called central tolerance. T cells that recognize a non-self peptide are nurtured and sent from the thymus to patrol the body, looking for evidence of non-self markers on cells, such as virally infected cells. Because cancer cells carry DNA mutations, which may alter protein/peptide sequences, tumor cells can also present non-self peptides bound to HLA platforms on the cell surface and, as a result, can be recognized and destroyed by T cells. In this case, the DNA mutation in a tumor creates a novel non-self peptide sequence, which, if it can be recognized by a TCR, is called a tumor-specific neoantigen, or TSNA. 
 Tumor-Specific Neoantigens 
 The notion that T cells can recognize TSNA on the surface of tumor cells is well established. It is only recently, however, that tools and techniques have been developed to test this idea in humans. Two advances proved critical. First, the advent of checkpoint inhibitors provided cohorts of cancer patients who developed immune responses that destroyed their tumors, leading to clinical responses that could be studied at a molecular level. Second, the development of fast, inexpensive DNA and RNA sequencing techniques provided the ability to sequence and catalog tumor DNA mutations that might give rise to neoantigens. T cells from cancer patients who had responded well to checkpoint inhibitors could then be screened against candidate neoantigens to see if the patient data supported the hypothesis that T cell recognition of TSNA could kill tumor cells effectively. 
 In 2014 and 2015, two of our co-founders, Dr. Timothy Chan and Dr. Naiyer Rizvi, brought these two concepts together in papers demonstrating that melanoma and lung cancer patients who responded to checkpoint inhibitor therapies had developed T cells that recognized TSNA (Snyder et al., The New England Journal of Medicine (2014); Rizvi et al., Science (2015)). Further evidence from Dr. Steven Rosenberg (Center for Cancer Research) and Dr. Ton Schumacher (Netherlands Cancer Institute) demonstrated that in patients with solid tumors, T cells could be found infiltrating tumors which were specific for TSNA, and could be expanded and used therapeutically to kill tumor cells (Stevanovic et al., Science (2017); Schumacher and Schreiber, Science (2015)). Together, this body of research suggests that in patients with common solid tumors, T cells can selectively destroy tumor cells through recognition of TSNA.

Immune Evasion 
 While some patients do respond to checkpoint inhibitor therapy with the mobilization of T cells that recognize TSNA and kill tumor cells, such patients are in the minority (0-20% for most common solid tumors (Kiy et al., Febs Letters (2013)). Research into this clinical observation has shown that patients who respond to checkpoint inhibitors typically have, prior to therapy, inflamed tumors that contain infiltrating T cells (particularly cytotoxic CD8+ T cells) and that express markers of immune activation.

 (Pembrolizumab) is Associated with Anti-Tumor T Cell Infiltration of the Tumor at

* | Adapted from Tumeh et al., Nature (2014)
--+-----------------------------------------

 While the immune systems of these patients have recognized their tumors through the recognition of TSNA, the tumor-specific T cells have been shut down or inactivated in the tumor. Checkpoint inhibitors are capable of “re-activating” these T cells, but most patients fail to respond to checkpoint inhibitor treatment because tumor-specific T cells are absent from the tumor due to tumor “evasion” of the patient’s immune response. We believe it is highly likely these patients have so-called “naïve” T cells in their bodies that have the ability to recognize the TSNA on tumor cells but that have not yet been activated. As a result, immune recognition, or the activation of the naïve T cells to the tumor antigen, and the generation of a large memory tumor-specific T cell response has not (yet) taken place. 
 Our Therapeutic Hypothesis
 TSNA offer extremely attractive therapeutic targets for T cell-directed therapy because they are non-self and tumor-specific, and have been shown to function as the key T cell targets in humans responding to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. The fact that TSNA are non-self has several key implications: 

• | Every person’s existing, internal TCR repertoire of naïve T cells should be able to recognize TSNA presented by any tumor that arises within the body.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A potent, focused T cell response against TSNA should be limited to an attack on the tumor, with minimal destruction of normal cells (off-tumor toxicity).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | TSNA are key targets for an effective human anti-tumor immune response, which means TSNA can be used therapeutically.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our fundamental therapeutic hypothesis is that patients with common solid tumors often have TSNA, but the tumors have successfully evaded the patient’s immune system. Our goal is simple—to activate a potent TSNA-targeted T cell response using routine therapeutic interventions.

Our Gritstone EDGE Platform
 Design of Our EDGE Platform 
 Neoantigens in tumors are created via a multi-step process starting with mutation in the cancer DNA, and leading to mutated peptides presented by the HLA on the surface of tumor cells. To select neoantigens for immunotherapy for cancer patients, we created our EDGE platform, which captures the essential elements of neoantigen biology via a combination of laboratory assays and computational analyses. The two steps of our EDGE platform prediction process are shown in Figure 2 below. 
Figure 2. EDGE Platform
 

EDGE Step 1—Mutation Identification 
 Identification of neoantigens requires accurate identification of tumor mutations and measurement of their expression levels in patient cancer specimens. To achieve this, we have built an in-house next-generation sequencing laboratory to perform deep sequencing of tumor DNA and RNA, as well as sequencing of the patient’s normal DNA. This first step in the EDGE process analyzes routine, core needle, formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor biopsies and identifies tens to hundreds of tumor mutated sequences. 
EDGE Step 2—Neoantigen Prediction 
 Only a small fraction of tumor mutated sequences are expected to result in actual neoantigens presented on the surface of tumor cells. This fraction may be as low as approximately 1% of all mutations. To accurately predict which neoantigens will be presented on the surface of tumor cells, we have generated a large dataset of HLA/peptides from human tumor and matched normal tissue specimens. Our process isolates and sequences HLA/peptides, using an immunopeptidomic mass spectrometry approach. We also analyze tumors for level of RNA expression of all genes. Our dataset now comprises more than 300 resected tissue specimens, spanning lung, colon, ovarian and gastric cancers from patients of various ancestries to ensure broad coverage of diverse patient HLA types. Each tumor specimen yields thousands of HLA/peptides and the total dataset has now grown to over one million HLA-presented peptides. 
 We use a subset of these and selected published peptide datasets to train a machine-learning model for neoantigen prediction in our EDGE platform. The model learns the critical DNA/RNA sequence features and other factors like RNA expression that lead to a greater likelihood of peptide presentation by the HLA. Our EDGE model analyzes mutated peptides in turn and calculates the probability that the peptide will be presented by the patient’s HLA on the surface of the tumor cell, or HLA-presented peptides. We prioritize mutations with the highest probability of presentation for inclusion in that patient’s personalized immunotherapy. The EDGE model training and clinical application are illustrated in Figure 3 below.

Figure 3. EDGE Model Training and Application
 

EDGE Neoantigen Prediction Performance
 Accurate TSNA prediction is critical for our personalized immunotherapy, and we have evaluated the prediction performance of our EDGE model in two ways. First, we assessed the ability of the EDGE model to predict HLA presented peptides. We then tested whether the ability to predict HLA presented peptides translated into the ability to predict which mutations give rise to neoantigens with tumor-relevant T cell responses in patients. These results were recently published in Nature Biotechnology (Bulik-Sullivan et al., Nature Biotech., 2018).
 Prediction of HLA-Presented Peptides 
 To assess EDGE model performance for prediction of HLA presented peptides, we used five tumor samples with HLA/peptides measured by mass-spectrometry that were not included in model training. For these test specimens, we predicted which peptides are likely to be presented on the tumor cell surface. We evaluated the quality of our predictions by calculating the positive predictive value, or PPV, which is the fraction of predicted peptides that were detected on the tumor HLA. As a benchmark, we compared performance of our prediction to that of publicly available tools (such as MHCflurry or NetMHC). Averaged over the test samples, our EDGE platform achieved a PPV of 54%, representing a nine-fold improvement over standard methods, as shown in Figure 4 below. We believe that TSNA selected by our EDGE platform have a much higher likelihood of being useful targets for immunization than those selected using industry standard methods.

Figure 4. Performance of EDGE Model for HLA/Peptide Prediction
 


Prediction of TSNA with T Cell Responses in Patients 
 To show that our prediction of HLA/peptide presentation enables prediction of tumor-specific neoantigens that can be targeted by T cells in patients, we assembled a test set of independently validated, published neoantigens. The dataset comprised four separate studies in the literature, with over 2,000 mutations from 17 patients with melanoma, gastro-intestinal cancer and breast cancer, comprehensively analyzed for anti-tumor immune response using either tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs, or activated T cells from the blood. In these studies, 12 of the 17 patients exhibited pre-existing T cell responses, with 26 neoantigens identified. Applying our EDGE model to select the top ten mutations for each patient from DNA/RNA sequence alone, we found that 11 out of the 12 patients with tumor-specific neoantigens had at least one neoantigen identified. In contrast, a standard approach identified true neoantigens for only four patients.

These results are illustrated in Figure 5 below. 
 Figure 5. EDGE Platform Identification of TSNA for Immunization in 12 Patients

Applying our EDGE model to select the top twenty mutations for each patient, we found that a majority (19 of 26, 73%) of the tumor-specific neoantigens were included. 
 Ongoing EDGE Platform Validation 
 To further validate our EDGE platform’s ability to identify TSNA in patients, we are also analyzing peripheral blood obtained from NSCLC patients receiving PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors in an observational clinical study, wherein T cell recognition of predicted TSNA is assessed. This process is shown in Figure 6 below. 
Figure 6. Gritstone Analysis of Neoantigen T Cell Responses in NSCLC Patients
 

Initial data from this study have shown that our EDGE platform identified TSNA-specific T cells in a majority (5 of 9, 56%) of NSCLC patients tested, with an average of two peptides recognized per patient in patients with detectable TSNA-specific T cells. 
 Genomic and immune response data from our clinical trials will serve to further validate and refine our EDGE platform.

Our Personalized Tumor-Specific Neoantigen Therapy
 Overview 
 Our therapeutic hypothesis is that treatment with personalized TSNA-containing vectors combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy will generate de novo, or augment existing, selective, TSNA-specific T cell response, unleashing the natural power of the immune system on tumor cells, potentially improving efficacy without a substantial increase in off-tumor toxicity. Our personalized immunotherapy candidate is designed to fit easily into a community oncology setting and to be administered in earlier lines of treatment rather than only in refractory or relapsed cancers. We have designed our personalized immunotherapy candidate such that oncologists will not have to alter their treatment practices, and we believe that this will extend the utility of our medicines into the community setting and not limit their use to scarce centers of excellence. We believe that as a result of its design, our personalized immunotherapy candidate has the potential to expand the efficacy of immunotherapy into broader patient populations. 
Our Personalized Immunotherapy Process 
 Our personalized immunotherapy process leverages our proprietary EDGE platform to predict the TSNA that will be presented on a patient’s tumor, allowing us to create a patient-specific heterologous prime-boost immunotherapy that is designed to elicit a potent anti-tumor T cell response. This process is outlined in Figure 7 below. 
Figure 7. Gritstone’s Personalized Immunotherapy Process
 

Step 1—Routine Biopsy 
 Most cancer care takes place in a community oncologist’s office rather than an academic center, and we believe products should ideally be designed to be usable in these settings. We are designing and developing our product candidate for administration early in the cancer treatment paradigm, particularly where disease burden is low and a cure is perceived to be more likely. Such early care is also heavily weighted to the community oncologist setting. Consequently, our product development process necessarily begins with a routine biopsy to obtain a specimen of the tumor with a standard needle biopsy performed by an oncologist or radiologist. 
Step 2—Sequencing 
 We then apply customized deep-sequencing and bioinformatic processes in-house to the patient’s tumor biopsy specimen and blood to derive high-quality DNA and RNA sequence information and identify tens to hundreds of tumor mutations. 
Step 3—Neoantigen Prediction 
 This tumor mutation sequence data is then entered into our proprietary EDGE platform. Our evolving artificial intelligence platform then predicts the TSNA most likely to be presented on the tumor cell surface. 
 
11


Step 4—Personalized Immunotherapy 
 We assemble the predicted TSNA into a patient-specific “cassette.” The cassette is incorporated into our heterologous prime-boost personalized immunotherapy, which is manufactured and filled into a vial. 
Step 5—Simple Injection 
 The vial is then shipped to the oncologist’s office where it is delivered to the patient by simple intramuscular injection. Our personalized immunotherapy candidate is designed to be administered in combination with standard checkpoint inhibitors to drive large numbers of TSNA-specific T cells to the tumor site, where they remain active. 
Our Lead Product Candidate (GRANITE-001)
 Our therapeutic goal is to drive a large and sustained T cell response against all TSNA presented on a patient’s tumor. Cancer patients may have pre-existing memory T cells directed against some of the TSNA delivered within the neoantigen cassette in their personalized immunotherapy. Boosting such pre-activated TSNA-specific T cells requires less antigen-specific stimulation than priming naïve T cells that have not yet been activated against their respective neoantigen. Importantly, early clinical data in the field suggest that for the majority of TSNA within the immunotherapy cassette, priming naïve T cells will be required to mount a large immune response. Priming naïve T cells is a multi-step process that requires a potent antigen delivery platform able to deliver cassette neoantigens in a highly immunogenic manner. 
 Human infectious disease vaccine experience has taught us that delivering antigens within an adenoviral vector can prime a substantial T cell response consisting of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T-helper cells. We believe an adenoviral vector is one of the most potent antigen-delivery platforms to prime naïve T cells. Peptide vaccination has not been able to accomplish this goal. 
 We believe that continued immune pressure upon the tumor is likely necessary to prevent immune escape by the tumor and drive a durable clinical response. To sustain high numbers of tumor-specific T cells, the same tumor-specific antigen can be given in a different vector from that used to prime, as a boost immunization. This heterologous prime-boost concept has been shown to activate and sustain high antigen-specific T cell responses, as shown in Figure 8 below. 
 Figure 8. Comparison of Heterologous Prime-Boost with Homologous Prime-Boost and Prime Alone
 


Our Construct 
 Our personalized immunotherapy candidate consists of (1) a prime vector and (2) a boost vector, both of which contain (3) the same personalized “cassette” containing the top-20 predicted patient-specific neoantigens: 

1. | Prime Vector. The prime vector is a chimpanzee adenovirus, or ChAdV. There is extensive clinical experience with the ChAdV vector platform in infectious disease studies over the last 20 years demonstrating that ChAdV vectors are well tolerated and consistently generate rapid and substantial CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses that have been shown, in a Phase 2b randomized controlled trial, to protect humans against infections such as malaria.

2. | Boost Vector. The boost is a self-amplifying mRNA, or SAM, formulated in a lipid nanoparticle, or LNP. A SAM vector comprises RNA that encodes the selected target antigens, such as TSNA, plus an RNA polymerase. After injection into muscle and uptake into host cells, the RNA is translated into protein, and the RNA polymerase starts to replicate the originally injected source RNA, amplifying the number of copies within the cells dramatically. This leads to production of large amounts of the delivered target antigens. During the RNA replication, RNA structures that are foreign to a normal cell are generated, which drives a strong danger signal to surrounding immune cells, triggering an early immune reaction (innate immune response). The presence of large quantities of antigen in an immune-stimulating environment drives profound antigen-specific T cell responses (adaptive immune responses). This approach is fundamentally distinct from using mRNA, which does not possess these attractive properties.

3. | Personalized Cassette. Within each of the two vectors used for the prime and boost immunizations, we include a cassette that is the only personalized component of the process. This cassette contains the top-20 predicted patient-specific TSNA. The same neoantigen cassette is used for both prime and boost vectors for each patient. We have designed the cassette to contain 20 TSNA based on several considerations, including TSNA prediction performance, potential immune competition and manufacturing factors.

 The prime and boost immunotherapy construction is depicted in Figure 9 below. 
 Figure 9. Prime and Boost Immunotherapy Construction
 



Our current manufacturing process includes Gritstone and qualified third-party contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, sites that are designed to operate under cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process starts when tumor samples are received by our sequencing lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Our EDGE platform is used to select 20 appropriate genetic sequences for neoantigen manufacturing, and a qualified CMO inserts these genetic sequence cassettes into standard plasmid backbones. The ChAdV vector, which encodes the genetic sequence in the cassette, is sent to our Pleasanton, California facility for manufacturing the prime immunotherapy, and the SAM vector, which encodes the genetic sequence in the cassette, is sent to a qualified CMO for manufacturing the boost immunotherapy. This end-to-end process, from biopsy receipt to shipment of the personalized heterologous prime-boost immunotherapy to the clinical site for patient administration, will initially take approximately 16-20 weeks. This period is consistent with the stated production and release times for other personalized immunotherapy approaches (mRNA or peptide) described in the literature and, importantly, acceptable for deployment in early treatment of cancer patients in the adjuvant setting where clinical urgency is lower as compared to the relapsed or refractory late stage setting in which adoptive T cell therapy may be utilized. 
 The ability to control the manufacturing of a high-quality personalized immunotherapy product, and scale production if early data are positive, is critical for efficient clinical development and commercialization. Our goal is to internalize the majority of the manufacturing steps to drive down both cost and production time, as well as establish full control over intellectual property and product quality. We have invested significant resources in our Cambridge, Massachusetts sequencing lab and our Pleasanton, California manufacturing facility to address these needs and to position us to control the critical steps in our personalized immunotherapy product production.

Our Preclinical Non-Human Primate Data 
 Our goal is to drive a large and sustained TSNA-specific T cell response to control tumor growth and/or eradicate the tumor. Published data from adoptive T cell therapies provide preliminary guidance on clinically efficacious T cell levels in patients. These studies suggest that T cell levels of approximately 10,000 antigen-specific T cells per milliliter of blood measured in patients four weeks post-infusion indicate clinical benefit. 
 We have focused our preclinical program on assessing the potency of our immunotherapy candidate in non-human primates, or NHPs, because published data suggests that NHPs’ immune responses to our immunotherapy candidate will better predict human data than murine models due to the comparative similarities between NHP and human immune systems. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that T cell responses induced in NHPs were predictive of responses in human clinical trials—the same relative potency was observed for different vaccinations in NHPs and humans. In these studies, a small 1.5- to three-fold decrease in absolute T cell response was measured when comparing NHPs to humans. By contrast, murine models, while simple, have been shown to be less likely to predict outcomes of cancer immunotherapy in humans, believed to be due to the many differences in immune system components between humans and mice. 
 We have completed two preclinical studies in NHPs to demonstrate the ability of our heterologous prime-boost immunotherapy approach to prime a potent immune response against the non-self model antigens delivered within the cassette. We constructed ChAdV and SAM vectors encoding viral, non-self model antigens because NHPs do not have tumors or TSNA. We collected blood samples, which include T cells, throughout the studies pre- and post-immunization to measure the kinetics and level of T cell responses specifically directed against the model antigens. T cells were isolated from the blood and the number of antigen-specific T cells are reported as spot forming cells, or SFCs, per 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs, which is a measure of the number of antigen-specific cytokine secreting cells (typically T cells) in an NHP. CD8+ T cells comprise one of the critical fractions of T cells quantified with this T cell assay.
 In our experiments, the NHPs immunized with ChAdV showed a rapid priming of T cell responses that peaked 14-21 days after immunization with combined immune responses to all six non-self model antigens of approximately 2,000 spot-forming cells, or SFCs, per 106 PBMCs. These data are consistent with immune responses reported in the literature for adenoviral vectors. Administration of a SAM boost, four weeks after the ChAdV prime, increased T cell responses approximately two-fold, with combined immune responses to all six non-self model antigens of approximately 4,000 SFCs per 106 PBMCs measured seven days after the SAM boost, as shown in Figure 10 below. These T cell responses increased further after a second SAM boost at week 12, to around 5,000 SFCs per 106 PBMCs and were maintained at these levels for four weeks without further boosts. T cell responses to each individual antigen were broadly comparable in magnitude for four of the six antigens administered. We anticipate that this breadth of T cell response against multiple antigens delivered within the cassette will be essential for the control of tumors within a patient. 
 Figure 10. Immune Response in NHPs to Heterologous Prime-Boost Immunotherapy Without Co-Administration of Checkpoint Inhibitors

The literature suggests that the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors increases T cell expansion when combined with a vaccine. To study this concept, we administered our immunization to NHPs in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor anti-CTLA-4. Co-administration of anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies, or mAb, with the ChAdV immunotherapy significantly increased ChAdV priming with a combined T cell response of approximately 7,500 SFCs per 106 PBMCs observed four weeks after immunization, as shown in Figure 11 below. The SAM boost administered four weeks after the prime immunization with anti-CTLA-4, increased the antigen specific T cell response further, reaching T cell levels greater than 10,000 SFCs per 106 PBMCs. A second SAM boost in combination with the anti-CTLA-4 antibody given eight weeks after the first boost immunization expanded the antigen-specific T cells further to peak levels reaching greater than 14,000 SFCs per 106 PBMCs one week after the boost which were maintained at levels between 9,000-10,000 SFCs per 106 PBMCs for several weeks. Thus, our heterologous prime-boost immunotherapy approach induced T cell numbers between 5,000-14,000 SFC per 106 PBMCs that were sustained over 16 weeks. 
 Figure 11. Immune Response in NHPs to Heterologous Prime-Boost Immunotherapy in Combination with Checkpoint Inhibitor Anti-CTLA-4
 

In order to compare the number of robust antigen-specific T cells induced by our heterologous prime-boost approach in NHPs directly to the literature data from adoptive T cell therapies, we converted our units of SFCs per 106 PBMCs to units of CD8+ T cells per milliliter of blood and plotted them against the T cell data from various clinical studies (which we also converted, where necessary, to T cells per milliliter of blood). One milliliter of blood is estimated to contain around three million PBMCs. The comparative data suggest that the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell numbers reached with our immunotherapy in NHPs (shown in the leftmost bar of Figure 12 below) is in the range of the T cell levels achieved in cancer patient clinical responders to adoptive T cell therapies (shown in the three rightmost bars in Figure 12 below), even when anticipating a 1.5- to three-fold decrease in the number of T cells induced in humans versus NHPs (as noted in the literature). Such substantial T cell numbers have not, to our knowledge, been reached with a therapeutic cancer vaccine in clinical studies to date. Furthermore, in addition to priming numerically substantial T cell responses against the cassette neoantigens, our immunotherapy regimen has been shown to induce T cells of high functional quality in NHPs, with a cytokine secretion profile seen in highly functional and cytotoxic T cells.

Figure 12. Comparison of Number of T Cells Induced by Our Immunotherapy in NHPs to Number of T Cells Observed in Clinical Responders to Adoptive T Cell Therapies



We believe that continued immune pressure upon the tumor is likely necessary to prevent immune escape by the tumor and consequently drive a durable clinical response. High T cell titers persisting for at least six months were induced by the heterologous prime-boost immunotherapy approach in combination with anti-CTLA-4, as shown in Figure 13 below. 
Figure 13. Gritstone’s Immunotherapy Platform ChAdV + SAM + anti-CTLA-4


To compare the durability of the T cell responses induced with our heterologous prime-boost immunotherapy approach in NHPs to the persistence of T cells post adoptive T cell therapy in humans, we plotted our T cell data over time against the data described in the literature of a recently approved CD19-specific adoptive T cell therapy. The data in Figure 14 below show that T cell numbers induced in NHPs with our heterologous prime-boost immunotherapy were more durable over a period of four months than T cell numbers observed over the same period in humans who responded to adoptive T cell therapy.

 Safety 
 We have performed a ten-week toxicity study governed by Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations of the ChAdV and the SAM prime-boost in NHPs to assess safety. The heterologous prime-boost immunotherapy, when administered intramuscularly, was well tolerated at the clinical maximal dose of each therapy. 
Our Clinical Development Strategy 
 We are employing an innovative and flexible clinical study design in an effort to execute a potentially faster-to-market strategy in a rapidly evolving and competitive treatment landscape. In order to accelerate the execution of our Phase 1 and Phase 2 program, we are using a seamless Phase 1/2 trial design. A seamless design refers to an integrated Phase 1 and Phase 2 trial protocol that allows rapid transition following dosing and tolerability confirmation during the Phase 1 portion to establishing proof-of-concept in the Phase 2 cohort expansion portion without compromising patients’ safety or incurring delay for analysis or approval. Data obtained from this Phase 1/2 trial will inform the design and initiation of Phase 2/3 studies with registrational intent in the metastatic and adjuvant settings in specific tumor types, for both GRANITE-001, our personalized tumor-specific immunotherapy product candidate, and SLATE-001, our shared tumor-specific immunotherapy product candidate. Advanced NSCLC and gastroesophageal, bladder and MSS (micro-satellite stable) colorectal cancers are the initial indications for the Phase 1 portion of our GRANITE-001 initial trial. These indications have been selected for several reasons, including high mutational load, response to checkpoint inhibitors, large patient populations, manufacturing time, emerging treatment landscape, regulatory pathway, the ability to combine personalized immunotherapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors and the opportunity to generate de novo immune responses and/or amplify existing anti-tumor T cell responses in order to improve the depth and durability of clinical responses. 
 Our Phase 1/2 Trial (GO-004) 
 In September 2018, our IND for our lead product candidate, GRANITE-001, was cleared by the FDA, and in December 2018, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to GRANITE-001 for the treatment of colorectal cancer. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated our first-in-human, Phase 1/2 trial, which we refer to as GO-004, with investigation of intramuscular heterologous prime-boost immunization with ChAdV and SAM in combination with mAb to PD-1 and CTLA-4. Our Phase 1/2 trial will enroll newly diagnosed, advanced lung, gastric and bladder cancer patients who are receiving first-line chemotherapy treatment. Production of the immunotherapy will take place while patients are receiving their initial chemotherapy, and we will administer our experimental, personalized immunotherapy candidate in combination with checkpoint inhibitors as either maintenance therapy or second-line therapy. We will also include relapsed colorectal cancer patients with MSS tumors whose responses to current immunotherapies are trivial (Le at al., NEJM (2015)) and who have been predicted to have adequate TSNA to merit inclusion in our program. We will exclude patients who have large neoantigen loads and are well served by currently approved immunotherapy, such as melanoma patients and those with colorectal cancer with microsatellite instability. The Phase 1 portion of our seamless Phase 1/2 trial will seek to establish a dose for further investigation in Phase 2 and to evaluate safety, tolerability and, importantly, immunogenicity of our lead product candidate. Efficacy signals may not be observed nor be interpretable during the Phase 1 portion. Thus, we will seek to further evaluate efficacy and safety in the Phase 2 cohort expansion portion in several common solid tumor types.

We believe co-administration of checkpoint inhibitors with personalized immunotherapy is a rational way to augment the T cell response and potential efficacy of the therapeutic regimen. Use of mAb to PD-1 is believed to unleash T cells which have been functionally silenced in tumor tissue by local PD-1 expression. Administration of antagonistic mAb to CTLA-4, an early inhibitory marker of T cell activation, has been shown to broaden the T cell response. Local subcutaneous administration of anti-CTLA-4 provides high drug concentration in the vaccination site-draining lymph node while minimizing systemic exposure, which we believe will optimize the benefit-risk ratio of our experimental regimen. We will be provided with checkpoint inhibitors by our collaborator, BMS. 
 The Phase 1 portion of GO-004 consists of two parts. All patients will receive anti-PD-1 intravenously. Part A of the Phase 1 portion of GO-004 will first examine the safety, tolerability, dose, immunogenicity and early efficacy of the initial administration of ChAdV as a prime succeeded by multiple dose levels of SAM boosts (heterologous prime-boost); Part B will consist of the co-administration of subcutaneous anti-CTLA-4 with ChAdV prime and SAM boosts at the dose established at the end of Part A. Depending upon accrual rate and safety signals, we expect to receive preliminary immunogenicity data by the end of 2019 with possible very early efficacy signals. 
 Figure 15 below illustrates the Phase 1 portion of our Phase 1/2 trial design (GO-004). 
 Figure 15. Phase 1 Portion of Phase 1/2 Design (GO-004)
 

Upon completion of the Phase 1 portion of GO-004, we will aim to demonstrate proof-of-concept in the Phase 2 portion where we will administer the heterologous prime-boost regimen in combination with intravenous anti-PD-1 mAb and subcutaneous anti-CTLA-4 at the recommended Phase 2 dose established during Phase 1. The Phase 2 portion of GO-004 will consist of single-arm expansion cohorts in “cold” tumors where checkpoint inhibitors alone have very low efficacy (such as MSS colorectal cancer), and potentially randomized cohorts in typically more inflamed tumors (such as lung, gastric or bladder cancer), where checkpoint inhibitors are known to have some activity. We will also assess the efficacy of a SAM homologous prime-boost immunotherapy regimen in different tumor types. 
 We hypothesize that personalized immunotherapy should ideally be administered in earlier lines of treatment, in the context of minimal residual disease and an optimal immune system. Depending on the safety profile observed during the Phase 1 portion of GO-004 and in parallel to single-arm cohort expansions in the Phase 2 portion of GO-004, we are considering options to conduct randomized Phase 2 trials in stage III unresectable tumors, such as lung cancer, where our personalized immunotherapy would be used as consolidation following first-line chemo-radiotherapy. Likewise, in patients with tumors at very high risk of relapse following complete surgical resection, such as patients with triple-negative breast cancer, colorectal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or ovarian cancer, we may use our personalized immunotherapy candidate in the adjuvant setting to prevent recurrence of their disease. In this particularly challenging setting, we plan to use circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA, to detect the presence of remaining tumor cells following surgery and during adjuvant immunotherapy. We believe ctDNA technology will soon be accepted by investigators and health authorities as a validated surrogate endpoint of efficacy alongside well-established clinical endpoints, such as metastasis-free survival, progression-free survival and overall survival. 
 Throughout our clinical development, we will closely monitor the generation of T cells both in the blood and infiltrating the tumor microenvironment, and determine differences in the mutational and neoantigen profile of ctDNA from a patient at multiple time points during chemotherapy and immunotherapy along with additional blood- and tumor-based biomarkers including, but not limited to, serum cytokines and circulating immune cells, gene expression profiling for immune-related and tumor-related proteins, immune cell infiltration and composition and sequencing of the TCR on TILs.

Off-The-Shelf Neoantigen-Directed Immunotherapy Product (SLATE)
 Our personalized immunotherapy product, GRANITE-001, is an attractive approach to neoantigen-directed immunotherapy for the largest possible number of cancer patients. A key question in the field is whether there are neoantigens which are shared by multiple patients and may thus be used to design an off-the-shelf neoantigen-directed product for a particular subset of patients with these shared neoantigens. Using our EDGE platform, we are identifying certain neoantigens arising from genes which are recurrently mutated in cancer because their function is altered in a cancer-promoting manner. Such mutations are termed driver mutations, and they are well characterized given their importance as functional drug targets. Examples include activating mutations in KRAS or EGFR genes which drive cell proliferation and/or growth, and inactivating mutations in genes such as TP53 and APC which normally limit DNA damage or cell proliferation, respectively. As noted above, the existence of a neoantigen is determined by the combination of a mutated peptide and the presenting HLA molecule. It has been demonstrated that a common KRAS mutation (G12D), often found in colorectal cancer, could be processed by tumor cells and presented as a functional neoantigen by tumor cells carrying the HLA-C*08:02 protein. This combination of KRAS mutation and HLA is estimated to be found in 1-2% of colorectal cancer patients. KRAS mutations are also common in lung and pancreatic cancers. 
 Building on this observation, we have applied our EDGE antigen prediction model to common tumor driver mutations and predicted a large set of candidate shared neoantigens. Early analyses suggest that while each such shared neoantigen may only be found in less than 2% of patients with a particular tumor type, our heterologous prime-boost can deliver at least 20 of these TSNA, which we believe will result in the off-the-shelf product having an addressable population of approximately 10-15% of patients within common solid tumor types such as colorectal cancer and lung cancer. Our off-the-shelf product candidates, the first of which in development is SLATE-001, are expected to be specific to a particular tumor type(s), and the TSNA cassette is fixed for each product. The process for determining which patients are eligible for SLATE therapy is illustrated below in Figure 16. 
 Figure 16. Gritstone’s Prime/Boost Platform Enables Multiple Product Options Including Gritstone’s Off-The-Shelf Immunotherapy Platform, SLATE-001


While our off-the-shelf SLATE product candidate series utilizes the same heterologous prime-boost system as GRANITE-001, the viral prime and RNA boost contains a fixed TSNA cassette that is designed for the subset of patients who carry the relevant antigens and HLA types. Given the commonality between GRANITE-001 and our SLATE product candidate series, we expect that there will be no additional pre-clinical work required for a particular SLATE product candidate to enter clinical testing following the Phase 1 portion of GRANITE-001’s Phase 1/2 clinical trial. We also expect to investigate clinical combinations of SLATE product candidates with immune checkpoint inhibitors and are expecting to submit IND documentation in mid-2019 and, if the FDA authorizes us to proceed, to enter human clinical trials for SLATE-001 in the second half of 2019. Depending upon accrual rate and safety signals, we expect to receive preliminary efficacy data by the end of 2020. Based on the importance of KRAS as a shared neoantigen, we are currently evaluating the potential utility of SLATE-001 in patients with advanced colorectal (microsatellite stable) cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Our preliminary estimates of the addressable patient population in these diseases range from 10 to 15%. 
 The key to appropriate utilization of the off-shelf-product candidate is to accurately identify patients whose tumors contain at least one of the TSNA represented within the off-the-shelf product. The widespread use of tumor mutation panel sequencing in advanced cancer has enabled the identification of such patients, and complementary assessment of a patient’s HLA type is a standard clinical test, performed off a routine blood draw, and completed within 7-10 days by a clinical immunology laboratory. 
 
19


We expect that the manufacturing of the SLATE product candidate series will be carried out using our current supply chain. The off-the-shelf nature of the product candidates allows us to leverage our processes developed for personalized products. 
 Our EDGE Antigen Identification Engine—Beyond Tumor-Specific Neoantigens
 Our EDGE antigen discovery platform has also identified novel, functionally tumor-specific antigens which, as opposed to most TSNA, are commonly shared between patients. A leading set of shared tumor antigens derives from cancer testis antigens, or CTA, genes that are non-mutated and normally only expressed in the testis, but which can also be expressed by some tumor tissue. The testis is an immune privileged site such that it is able to express antigens without eliciting an immune response. CTA are well established in the literature and our approach has identified many genes, and antigens from within those genes, that may represent novel shared-tumor antigens. Currently, tumor-specific CTA targets are limited; known HLA/peptide CTA are present in only a fraction of patients within any given tumor type, with some tumor types exhibiting essentially no HLA/peptide targets available in the public domain. We believe our EDGE platform has the potential to unlock these tumor types for therapeutic development by providing novel cancer immunotherapy targets that may be exploited via several therapeutic modalities. 
 We are developing TCRs and antibodies that specifically recognize these novel shared tumor-specific antigens and their corresponding HLA surface proteins. These targets can be addressed therapeutically using several different formats, such as adoptive T cell therapy, bispecific antibody approaches and vaccination. These programs are in early development. Our TSNA and shared tumor antigen discovery programs are shown in Figure 17 below. 
 Figure 17. Our TSNA and Shared Tumor Antigen Discovery Programs
 

TCR-Mimetic Antibodies 
 While TCRs are the natural biological recognition elements on T cells for a particular HLA/peptide complex, it is possible to identify antibodies that bind with high affinity and selectivity to a particular HLA/peptide complex (Dubrovsky et al, Oncolmmunology (2016)). These have been termed TCR-mimetic antibodies. Working with a third-party contract research organization, or CRO, we have screened a highly diverse bacteriophage display library, and identified TCR-mimetic antibodies against several novel CTA HLA/peptide complexes that were identified by our proprietary EDGE platform. 
 During the isolation process, the library was negatively selected against a panel of closely-related peptide-HLA complexes resulting in highly specific leads without cross-reactivity to closely related structures. The candidate antibodies identified bear many properties that make them attractive entities to move forward as components of lead biologic drugs. First, they are directed against highly tumor-specific targets, allowing development of exquisitely selective drugs designed to bind only to tumor, leaving normal tissues untouched. Second, the leads exhibit good affinity, which can be further improved by directed evolution approaches as part of lead optimization. The library was comprised of single-chain versions of antibody variable domains (scFv), responsible for antigen binding. scFvs are ideal modular building blocks for combining multiple specificities into a single molecule. 
 
20


Figure 18. Comparison of one of Gritstone’s proprietary TCR-mimetic antibody in complex with peptide-HLA with a published TCR in complex with its cognate peptide-HLA (same HLA haplotype).
 

As indicated in the above figure, there are many striking similarities between the TCR-mimetic antibody and the TCR recognizing their MHC/peptide complexes, including footprint, angle of interaction, and overall surface area covered. 
 We have carefully defined the exact nature of TCR-mimetic antibody binding to peptide-HLA target antigens. We have individually altered each amino acid in the peptide (in the peptide-HLA complex) to establish the specificity of TCR-mimetic binding. We have also defined the footprint of TCR-mimetic antibody binding on its target using both (a) X-ray crystallography (direct visualization of binding) and (b) a “protection” assay whereby antibody binding to its target physically protects target structures from chemical modification. Figure 18 shows the high-resolution structure of one target peptide-HLA molecule in complex with one of our lead antibodies. The footprint and angle of interaction are strikingly similar between the TCR mimetic antibody and a published structure of a typical TCR bound to its cognate HLA/peptide complex. To date, multiple TCR-mimetic leads have been identified against a set of target HLA/peptide complexes for tumor-specific targets identified by our proprietary EDGE platform, that bind, similarly to the natural TCR interaction, with high affinity and specificity. These candidates are an ideal starting point for building a portfolio of bispecific antibody leads. 
 Bispecific antibodies 
 Monoclonal antibodies are an important component of immune defense against disease. The most common antibody type in humans, immunoglobulin G, or IgG, evolves within a human/patient and bears two identical arms to recognize its specific target. In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies employ different antigen specificities within the two arms—one arm recognizes a tumor antigen and the other recognizes immune-effector cells. We are developing bispecific antibodies using an anti-tumor TCR-mimetic antibody arm in the form of a Fab or a single chain antibody fragment, or scFv, as the tumor-binding domain of a bispecific antibody, thus generating a suite of bispecific antibodies capable of engaging our novel targets identified by the EDGE platform, as illustrated by Figure 19 below. 
 
21


Figure 19. Schematic representation of monoclonal antibodies and two exemplary bispecific formats.
 

In the above figure, variable domains are indicated as well as constant domains. Heavy chain and light chain variable domains come together to form the antigen binding fragment. A schematic of an alternative engineered version of this single-chain variable fragment, or scFv, is shown. BiSpecific molecules are shown comprised of normal antibody polypeptide chain pairing as well as an example incorporating a scFv for one specificity. All of our peptide-HLA TCR-mimetic antibodies were initially identified as scFv fragments, and they can be readily formatted as these modular binding domains or as normal antibody binding arms. 
 While many different bispecific antibody formats have been described, no single platform has emerged as an optimal solution for all targets or therapeutic applications. Rather, “rules” governing optimal activity are determined empirically for a given target pair. We are working to determine whether this target class has shared rules for optimal formatting. Critical parameters include number of binding sites for each target, spacing among the binding sites, and engineered or inherent properties to drive optimal serum half-life. Affinity for each target, as well as where specifically the bispecific antibody binds each target (epitope) are also important characteristics. We have built the capability to generate large numbers of lead candidate combinations employing our TCR mimetic antibodies formatted as scFv or as traditional antibody arms and combined with a variety of distinct targeting arms. Additionally, we are developing critical assays to evaluate the safety and potency of novel candidates. Finally, we are deploying state of the art developability and formulation techniques to ensure selection of candidates with robust drug-like properties for development. These capabilities will allow efficient selection of candidates to move forward through the optimization process and towards the clinic. 
 We have generated a variety of TCR-mimetic antibodies as bispecifics with different TCR-targeting arms and have promising in vitro proof of concept data, including binding and killing of cells displaying the peptide-HLA target.

The above figure illustrates a cell-based binding analysis that was performed at a single concentration (left) showing the distribution of binding signal to negative control and positive cells by one of our TCR-mimetic antibodies. The center panel shows the mean fluorescence intensity at a range of concentrations for the same antibody including controls. The right panel shows killing of cells bearing the target peptide-HLA by primary human immune cells as a function of BiSpecific antibody concentration (two different BiSAb formats).

While we rapidly advance our internal candidates to lead optimization, we also consider partnering. We recognize several advantages to partnering, including experience with proprietary effector targeting arms, experience with CMC, and assays for selection of ideal candidates. By pursuing both internal and external paths, we intend to maximize opportunities to rapidly advance to the clinic as well as to retain internal value and position for Gritstone. 
 T Cell Receptors 
 TCRs recognize HLA/peptides, and once we have identified CTA-derived peptides plus their HLA binding partner as tumor-specific antigens, we can proceed to the identification of matched TCRs. This is performed using healthy HLA-matched donors as a source of diverse T cells and screening these T cells against the target HLA/peptides. T cells that activate and expand in response to a target HLA/peptide will express relevant TCRs, and these can be characterized by isolation of the relevant T cells and sequencing of their TCR genes. These natural TCRs may offer advantages over alternative TCR identification approaches. We possess the internal expertise to identify HLA/peptide specific TCRs from HLA-matched donor blood, and we may partner those TCRs with established adoptive T cell therapy companies. 
 Strategic Collaboration with bluebird bio 
 In August 2018, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with bluebird bio, Inc., or bluebird, to utilize our EDGE platform to identify and validate tumor-specific targets and provide TCRs directed to ten selected targets for use in bluebird’s cell therapy platform. Under the collaboration, we received a non-refundable up-front cash payment of $20.0 million and an additional $10.0 million in equity investment in our Series C convertible preferred stock. We are also eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion in development, regulatory and commercial milestones associated with bluebird bio’s resulting cell therapy products, as well as tiered, single-digit royalties on sales of the TCR immunotherapy products that utilize the TCRs discovered by us. The royalty term for each TCR immunotherapy product shall be determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis and will commence on the first commercial sale of each product in a country and end on the latest of: (i) expiration or termination of the last to expire valid claim of the last licensed patent that covers the product pursuant to the agreement; (ii) expiration of all periods of regulatory exclusivity for the product in such country (in respect of sales in that country); and (iii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country (in respect of sales in that country). bluebird will be solely responsible for all costs and expenses of its development, manufacturing, and commercial activities for resulting therapies. 
 The identification, validation, selection and development of the TCRs will be conducted during an estimated five-year research term and may be extended by an additional year under certain conditions. The collaboration will be governed by a joint steering committee with representatives from us and bluebird. We and bluebird have exchanged non-exclusive licenses to carry out the research program, and, on a selected target-by-selected target basis, we have granted bluebird an exclusive worldwide license to research, develop, and commercialize resulting cell therapy products directed to such targets, including rights to utilize TCRs discovered by us. The collaboration term ends on a country-by-country and product candidate-by-product candidate basis based on completion of all payments owed to us by bluebird thereon. Either party may terminate the agreement upon written notice to the other party in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach, subject to a dispute resolution process. In addition, bluebird may terminate the agreement for convenience upon prior written notice to us. 
 Manufacturing and Process Development
 Manufacturing is a vital component of our personalized immunotherapy, and we are devoting significant resources to manufacturing and process development in order to optimize the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, as well as to reduce our per-unit manufacturing costs and time to market. The production of our personalized immunotherapy requires two distinct elements for each patient: tumor biopsy analysis to determine candidate neoantigens, followed by manufacture of vectors containing a personalized cassette encoding the selected neoantigens. The manufacture of these vectors involves complex processes, including per-patient plasmid production, mammalian cell production of virus and RNA synthesis and lipid encapsulation. 
 Our near-term goal is to carefully manage our fixed-cost structure, maximize optionality, and drive long-term cost of goods as low as possible. We currently use a hybrid approach to manufacturing our personalized immunotherapy whereby certain elements of our product candidates are manufactured on an out-sourced basis at CMOs, and other elements of our product candidates are manufactured internally at the 42,600 square foot manufacturing facility we established in 2017 in Pleasanton, California, all designed in compliance with cGMP. Our manufacturing strategy is designed to meet the demand needs of clinical supply and commercial launch, and we believe this hybrid approach will position us to support multi-center clinical trials and commercialization in the most time-efficient manner. In addition, the initial strategy of use of both CMOs and our own facility will provide capacity flexibility to meet potential changes in demand. 
 
23


To date, we have leveraged our relationships with CMOs for preclinical studies and Phase 1/2 clinical trial supply. Doing so has significantly accelerated our ability to advance clinical trials, gain insights into the multiple manufacturing processes and establish an infrastructure for future trials. We believe our use of CMOs will also increase the speed with which capacity can be brought online, as well as enable technology transfer of processes from the CMOs into our in-house facility. 
 Our manufacturing process begins with receipt of a patient’s routine biopsy and blood sample at our Cambridge, Massachusetts facility, where TSNA identification is performed using the EDGE platform. The TSNA sequences generated by our platform are sent electronically to a synthetic biology CMO to generate the patient-specific TSNA cassette, which is then cloned into each of the ChAdV and SAM vectors, and amplified. Following amplification, the ChAdV vector containing the cassette is sent to our Pleasanton, California facility for ChAdV manufacture and production into vials. In parallel, the SAM vector is sent to another CMO for RNA manufacture and then to a final CMO for formulation into LNP and production into vials. Currently, the entire manufacturing process, from biopsy receipt at Gritstone to the release and shipment of the personalized immunotherapy candidate to the clinical site for patient administration, takes approximately 16-20 weeks. We expect this production and release timeline (and associated cost) will diminish over time due to process scaling, potential improvements in production and testing technologies and internal process expertise as well as potential reductions in regulatory testing requirements based on clinical experience. 
 To achieve this, our process development group is focused on several key initiatives. The first is investigating novel approaches to manufacturing our products, including process optimization and quality by design of each intermediate, drug substance and drug product. Additionally, we are systematically characterizing our manufacturing processes, including product intermediates and manufacturing unit operations. This characterization effort will allow us to implement process changes over the entire product lifecycle and to quickly react to evolving process technologies that can lead to reductions in per-unit manufacturing costs and shorter process cycle times. In addition, we plan to establish automated, closed-platform manufacturing processes. Such processes should give us the ability to conduct manufacturing in a lower-classified, lower cost manufacturing environment for multiple steps of our drug product manufacturing. 
 Our medium-term goal is to internalize the majority of the manufacturing steps to drive down both cost and production time, as well as establish full control over intellectual property and product quality. We believe that operating our own manufacturing facility will provide us with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, will enable the more rapid implementation of process changes, and will allow for better long-term margins. We continue efforts toward the phased integration of all manufacturing into our Pleasanton, California biomanufacturing facility. The ChAdV prime production is already fully integrated into the Pleasanton facility and we have initiated efforts toward integrating the SAM boost production in-house. 
 Our manufacturing strategy is currently structured to support our U.S., E.U. and Australian development plans. We believe this manufacturing strategy developed for global distribution will enable use in other geographies. Specific supply strategies for other geographies will be developed as part of our clinical and commercial plans for such other geographies. 
 License Agreement with Arbutus Biopharma Corporation 
 On October 16, 2017, we executed a license agreement with Arbutus Biopharma Corporation, or Arbutus. Certain terms of the agreement were modified by amendment in July 2018. Arbutus is a leader in LNP technology with a broad intellectual property estate and a large library of LNPs, including multiple LNPs being used in clinical development by its partners, as well as the chemistry expertise to synthesize novel LNPs with properties optimal for SAM. 
 Under the agreement, Arbutus grants us a worldwide, exclusive (even as to Arbutus, subject to certain limited exceptions), sublicensable, transferable license, to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize our novel RNA-based platform for intracellular delivery of SAM encoding TSNA in combination with one or more of Arbutus’ proprietary LNPs. The licensed technology includes Arbutus’ portfolio of proprietary and clinically validated LNP products and associated intellectual property, and includes technology transfer of Arbutus’ manufacturing know-how. 
 As part of our collaboration, we have identified an LNP formulation that we believe will be optimal for use in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of GRANITE-001 and SLATE-001. This LNP formulation is currently being used by third parties in human clinical trials in the United States. We have also initiated an effort to screen Arbutus’ library of LNPs and evaluate novel LNPs to potentially identify an LNP that increases the potency of our SAM platform further. Our goal is to deliver a second generation SAM immunotherapy that has the potential to serve as a homologous prime-boost immunotherapy. 
 
24


Under the license agreement, we paid Arbutus an upfront payment of $5.0 million. We have also agreed to make aggregate payments of up to $73.5 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones for up to three products, and an aggregate $50.0 million in commercial milestone payments, as well as royalty payments in the low single-digits on net sales of licensed products for a royalty term lasting until the expiration of the last patent covered under the license. The last-to-expire patent is currently scheduled to expire on November 10, 2030. Pending applications will nominally expire 20 years after the filing date of the first utility application to which they claim priority. Following acceptance of our first IND in September 2018, we made the first milestone payment of $2.5 million to Arbutus, with further milestone payments not expected to occur before 2021. In addition, we will reimburse Arbutus for conducting technology development and providing manufacturing and regulatory support for our product candidates. 
 The Arbutus license continues in effect until the last to expire royalty payment or early termination. The license is terminable by us for convenience with 60 days prior written notice, upon payment of a no-cause termination sum. We may also terminate in the event of material adverse safety data for a product, failure to achieve a primary or secondary efficacy endpoint, or if a regulatory authority takes action that prevents us from commercializing any product. Either party may terminate the agreement for material breach, and Arbutus may terminate the agreement for abandonment or if we challenge Arbutus patents. 
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries put significant emphasis and resources into the development of novel and proprietary therapies for cancer treatment. We face substantial competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. We anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition in the field of cancer therapy as new therapies, technologies, and data emerge from the field. 
 In addition to the current standard of care for patients, commercial and academic clinical trials are being pursued by a number of parties in the field of immunotherapy. Results from these trials have fueled continued interest in immunotherapy and our competitors include: 
  
• | In the neoantigen space, Agenus Inc., Neon Therapeutics Inc., or Neon, BioNTech AG in collaboration with Genentech Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc. in collaboration with Merck & Co. Inc., Aduro Biotech, Inc., Advaxis Immunotherapies, Achilles Therapeutics, NousCom AG, ISA Pharmaceuticals BV, CureVac AG in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company, Genocea Biosciences Inc., Vaccibody AS and PACT Pharma, Inc., or PACT.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the bispecific antibody space, Roche, MacroGenics, Inc., Xencor Inc., Adimab LLC, Zymeworks Inc., F-Star Biotechnology Ltd., Novimmune SA, Genmab A/S, Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc., Merus N.V. and Immatics Biotechnologies GmbH.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the engineered cell therapy and TCR space, Novartis, Juno Therapeutics (acquired by Celgene Corporation), Kite Pharma (acquired by Gilead Sciences, Inc.), bluebird bio, Inc., Medigene AG, Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, Amgen Inc., Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., Autolus Limited, Cellectis S.A., PACT, Neon, Mustang Bio, Inc., Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc., TCR2 Therapeutics Inc., Editas Medicine, Inc., Unum Therapeutics Inc., Intrexon Corporation, CRISPR Therapeutics AG and Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, cost and convenience.

Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and services, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and internationally. Our patent estate includes patent applications with claims relating to our products, methods, and manufacturing processes, and broader claims for potential future products and developments. As of December 31, 2018, our solely-owned patent portfolio includes, on a worldwide basis, 52 pending patent applications and one issued patent relating to our products, methods, and manufacturing processes, including 18 pending patent applications in the United States, 34 pending patent applications filed internationally, and one issued U.S. patent relating to the use of a predictive model to identify neoantigens, particularly where the predictive model was trained using mass spectrometry data. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our solely-owned patent estate includes a portfolio of pending patent applications related to our neoantigen-based platform; and a portfolio of pending patent applications related to our shared antigen-based platform. Details regarding these portfolios are provided below. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our solely-owned patent portfolio related to our neoantigen-based platform includes 15 pending U.S. patent applications and 31 ex-U.S. patent applications pending in countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Columbia, the European Patent Office, Indonesia, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and Taiwan with claims related to neoantigen identification and related uses and manufacture. Any patents that may issue from these pending patent applications are expected to expire between 2036 and 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. These patent applications are all composition of matter, use, or process patent applications related to GRANITE-001. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our solely-owned patent portfolio related to our shared antigen-based platform includes three pending U.S. patent applications and three pending foreign patent applications with claims related to shared antigens, shared antigen-binding proteins, and their related uses and manufacture. Any patents that may issue from these pending patent applications are expected to expire between 2038 and 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we also enter into agreements with other third parties for non-exclusive rights to intellectual property directed to other technologies that are ancillary to our business, including laboratory information management software and research and development tools. 
 In addition to patents, we have filed for trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, as well as certain other international trademark agencies, for “Gritstone,” “Granite”, “Slate” and our logo. The “Gritstone” mark and our logo are registered trademarks in the United Kingdom as of October 5, 2018. Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. 
 In some instances, we submit patent applications directly with the USPTO as provisional patent applications. Provisional applications for patents were designed to provide a lower-cost first patent filing in the United States. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than 12 months after the provisional application filing date. The corresponding non-provisional application benefits in that the priority date(s) of the patent application is/are the earlier provisional application filing date(s), and the patent term of the finally issued patent is calculated from the later non-provisional application filing date. This system allows us to obtain an early priority date, add material to the patent application(s) during the priority year, obtain a later start to the patent term and to delay prosecution costs, which may be useful in the event that we decide not to pursue examination in an application. We file U.S. non-provisional applications and Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications that claim the benefit of the priority date of earlier filed provisional applications, when applicable. The PCT system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application, and to designate all of the 152 PCT member states in which national patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding patentability opinion which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for the national applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing fees. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications. 
 At the end of the period of two and a half years from the first priority date of the patent application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the PCT member states either by direct national filing or, in some cases by filing through a regional patent organization, such as the European Patent Organization. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications and enables substantial savings where applications are abandoned within the first two and a half years of filing. 
 
26


For all patent applications, we determine claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. Advice of counsel and our business model and needs are always considered. We file patents containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any products, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and products, assuming these are strategically valuable. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the pending and issued patent claims to ensure that maximum coverage and value are obtained for our processes, and compositions, given existing patent office rules and regulations. Further, claims may be modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs. 
 We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention, and the ability to satisfy the enablement requirement of the patent laws. The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates or for our technology platform. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, we have licensed rights under proprietary technologies of third parties to develop, manufacture and commercialize specific aspects of our products. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. The expiration of patents or patent applications licensed from third parties or our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future technology may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. 
 We further own trade secrets relating to our technology, and we maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets and know-how by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, consultants and employees who have access to such trade secrets and know-how. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us are to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In addition, we enter into employment agreements that require employees to assign to us any inventions, trade secrets or know-how that they develop while employed by us. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through agreements with our employees and consultants, these agreements may be breached, or third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions. 
 For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”

Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, its implementing regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a biologics license application, or BLA, and licensure, which constitutes approval, by the FDA before being marketed in the United States. None of our product candidates has been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States, and we currently have no BLAs pending. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during product development, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
 The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s GLP regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP regulations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Development 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 
28


In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules had historically been subject to review by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, of the National institutes of Health, or NIH, Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. On August 17, 2018, the NIH issued a notice in the Federal Register and issued a public statement proposing changes to the oversight framework for gene therapy trials, including changes to the applicable NIH Guidelines to modify the roles and responsibilities of the RAC with respect to human clinical trials of gene therapy products, and requesting public comment on its proposed modifications. Beginning during the public comment period, which closed on October 16, 2018, the NIH announced that it would no longer accept new human gene transfer protocols for review as a part of the protocol registration process or convene the RAC to review individual clinical protocols. These trials remain subject to the FDA’s oversight and other clinical trial regulations, and oversight at the local level will continue as set forth in the NIH Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Generally, a separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
  
• | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 
29


BLA Submission and Review 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
 Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 postmarket studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the FDA granted GRANITE-001 fast track designation for treatment of colorectal cancer in December 2018. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.

A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers. 
 Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. For products containing new molecular entities, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review). 
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 In 2017, FDA established a new regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016. The RMAT designation program is intended to fulfill the 21st Century Cures Act requirement that FDA facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug that meets the following criteria: (1) it qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Like fast track and breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. Once approved, when appropriate, the FDA can permit fulfillment of post-approval requirements under accelerated approval through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence such as electronic health records; through the collection of larger confirmatory datasets; or through post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with the therapy prior to approval. 
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. 
 
31


A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
 
32


Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered to a patient more than once, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the competing product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate implementation and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent; HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes which prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters, and which, as amended by HITECH, also imposes certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; the U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to the federal government, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.

Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. 
 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. No regulatory authority has granted approval for a personalized cancer immunotherapy based on a vaccine approach, and there is no model for reimbursement of this type of product. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. 
 In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional, and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, the Tax Act was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. Since the enactment of the Tax Act, there have been additional amendments to certain provisions of the ACA. Most recently, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint”, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the 
 
34


advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. While some proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 Our Interactions with the FDA
 Medical Device 
 In two separate FDA interactions, the FDA advised us that our machine learning software will not be subject to medical device diagnostic regulations. In August 2016, the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, determined that the TSNA prediction software is a Non-Significant Risk, or NSR, device, and that an investigational device exemption, or IDE, submission is not required to conduct clinical studies with our product candidate. In April 2017, the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, confirmed that medical device diagnostic regulations do not apply to our testing and processing of the patient-specific TSNA, and that quality requirements could be met through compliance with biologic cGMPs. Based on these interactions, we believe no additional device-related regulatory submissions (such as an IDE or pre-market approval application (PMA)) or device development activities are required and our TSNA prediction software procedure will be regulated as part of our cGMP manufacturing process. 
Preclinical Safety 
 To address the personalized nature of our therapy in a Pre-Pre-IND interaction with the FDA’s CBER Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, or OTAT, the FDA advised us that a single toxicological animal study with a representative vector could be able to support preclinical safety for purposes of IND submission. Subsequent to this discussion, we submitted proposed protocols for GLP toxicology and biodistribution studies for OTAT’s review in connection with a Pre-IND meeting, and OTAT agreed that a single GLP toxicology study could support IND submission. In this GLP toxicology study, we administered our ChAdV and the SAM vectors to Indian Rhesus macaques. The heterologous prime-boost immunotherapy approach when administered intramuscularly was well tolerated at the clinical maximal dose of each platform, with some animals presenting flu-like symptoms. Preclinical chemistry findings include a transient increase in select cytokines, which resolved rapidly. The FDA cleared our IND for GRANITE-001 in September 2018. 
 In addition, in December 2018, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to GRANITE-001 for the treatment of colorectal cancer.
 Clinical Regulatory 
 In our Pre-IND meeting with OTAT, the FDA previewed Clinical Protocol GO-004 and confirmed that the overall design appeared reasonable, while providing comments on the study populations and dose determination which we have incorporated into the protocol. OTAT also agreed with our dose limiting toxicity assessment criteria, while reserving comment on the starting dose and dose escalation pending the completion of planned preclinical studies. We intend to include these elements in the protocol, which may permit a faster progression and fewer patients to reach the clinical protocol’s combination cohort (Phase 1, Part C). 
Regulatory Chemistry, Manufacturing & Controls 
 In a Type-C Facilities meeting with the FDA’s CBER Division of Manufacturing and Product Quality, or DMPQ, we obtained FDA feedback on our proposed design for the multi-use clinical manufacturing facility in Pleasanton, California. Importantly, the FDA concurred with our plan to build a facility designed to accommodate manufacture of multiple patient-specific lots in parallel within the same manufacturing suite, which we expect will provide a substantial increase in scalability within a smaller allocation of cleanrooms. At our subsequent Pre-IND meeting with OTAT, the FDA agreed with our proposed use of select rapid release testing methods in which we proposed replacing standard cell-culture based tests with faster polymerase chain reaction methods. As agreed with the FDA, we submitted qualification of these methods in our IND submission for GRANITE-001. The FDA also agreed that our proposed stability program was generally acceptable to support the proposed Phase 1 clinical study of GRANITE-001, where only one representative patient lot per year will be placed on product stability during conduct of the clinical program.
