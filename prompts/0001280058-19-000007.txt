ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of Business
We are the world’s leading cloud software company powering social good. Serving the entire social good community—nonprofits, foundations, companies, education institutions, healthcare organizations and individual change agents—we connect and empower organizations to increase their impact through cloud software, services, expertise and data intelligence. Blackbaud brings more than three decades of leadership to this sector: since originally incorporating in New York in 1981 and later reincorporating as a South Carolina corporation in 1991 and as a Delaware corporation in 2004, our tailored portfolio of software and services has grown to support the unique needs of vertical markets, with solutions for fundraising and CRM, marketing, advocacy, peer-to-peer fundraising, corporate social responsibility, school management, ticketing, grantmaking, financial management, payment processing and analytics. Our solutions are designed to meet the needs of virtually all types of organizations in the social good community, from major global institutions to local soup kitchens. At the end of 2018, we had over 45,000 customers located in over 60 countries. We are deeply proud to play a part in our customers’ success in their missions to cure diseases, advance education, preserve and share arts and culture, help animals, support those in need and more.
Market Overview
The philanthropic industry is significant, and our addressable market is substantial and growing
Worldwide there are millions of social good organizations including nonprofits, foundations, companies, education institutions and healthcare organizations. Billions of individuals are also active participants in the social good community by donating funds, volunteering their time, advocating for a cause or otherwise engaging with social good organizations.
Our estimated current total addressable market ("TAM") is greater than $10 billion. This includes an expansion into new and near adjacencies in 2018, including our Cloud Solution for Faith Communities, our expanded Cloud Solution for Higher Education, our Integrated Cloud Initiative for Nonprofits in partnership with Microsoft, as well as our acquisition of YourCause Holdings, LLC ("YourCause") on January 2, 2019.
Traditional methods of fundraising and organizational management are often costly and inefficient
Many social good organizations use manual methods or stand-alone software applications not specifically designed for fundraising and organizational management for institutions like theirs. Such methods are often costly and inefficient because of the difficulties in effectively collecting, sharing and using donation-related information. Furthermore, general purpose software applications frequently have limited functionality and do not efficiently integrate multiple databases. Some social good organizations have developed proprietary software, but doing so is expensive, requiring on-site technical personnel for development, implementation and maintenance.

The nonprofit industry faces particular operational challenges
Nonprofit organizations, education institutions and healthcare organizations must efficiently:

• | Solicit funds and build relationships with major donors;


• | Garner small cash contributions from numerous contributors;


• | Manage and develop complex relationships with large numbers of constituents;


• | Advocate for policies and behaviors that advance their cause or institution;


• | Communicate their accomplishments and the importance of their mission online and offline;


• | Comply with complex accounting, tax and reporting requirements that differ from those for traditional businesses;


• | Solicit cash and in-kind contributions from businesses to help raise money or deliver products and services;


• | Provide a wide array of programs and services to individual constituents and beneficiaries; and


• | Improve the data collection and information sharing capabilities of their employees, volunteers and donors by creating and providing distributed access to centralized databases.

Because of these challenges, we believe nonprofits, healthcare organizations and education institutions can benefit from software applications and services specifically designed to serve their particular needs and workflows to grow revenue, work effectively and accomplish their missions.
Companies, grantmaking institutions and foundations also face unique challenges
Companies, grantmaking institutions and foundations, face their own unique challenges, including the need to:

• | Quantify and improve the impact of their grants;


• | Cultivate better relationships with grantees;


• | Achieve better internal collaboration and alignment with board members, reviewers and other stakeholders;


• | Illustrate the impact of their corporate philanthropy efforts to the communities they serve;


• | Engage employees in meaningful volunteering, giving and other activities;


• | Ensure that their philanthropic efforts align with their business initiatives;


• | Manage all of a foundation's activities, including fundraising and accounting;


• | Expand the reach of their fundraising efforts; and


• | Cultivate new and existing donors.

Strategy
Our objective is to maintain and extend our position as the leading provider of cloud software and services for the global social good community, supporting its missions from fundraising to delivering outcomes. Our key strategies for achieving this objective are to:
Delight our customers
We intend to make our customers' experience with us effective, efficient and satisfying from their initial interest in our solutions and services through their decision to purchase, engage with customer support and utilize solution enhancements. We continue to focus on initiatives aimed at improving the consistency and quality of user experience across our offerings. We also continue to evolve the manner in which we package and sell our offerings to provide high quality and value combined with flexibility to meet the unique needs of our existing and prospective customers. For example, we have increased the number of our cloud solutions sold under a subscription pricing model, which can make it easier for customers to purchase our solutions. In addition, we are continuing to integrate value-adding capabilities such as payment services, analytics and business intelligence into our suite of solutions to better address our customers' needs with comprehensive 

2018 Form 10-K

Blackbaud, Inc.

offerings. We will continue to focus on providing the highest level of solution support, enhancing our existing solutions and developing new solutions and services designed to help our customers be more effective and achieve their missions.
Execute on our Four-Point Growth Strategy
During 2018, we continued to execute our four-point growth strategy targeted to drive an extended period of solution and service innovation, quality enhancement, increased operating efficiency and improved financial performance:

1. | Integrated and Open Solutions in the Cloud

We will continue to transition our business to predominantly serve customers through a subscription-based cloud delivery model, enabling lower cost of entry, greater scalability and lower total cost of ownership to our customers. We continue to optimize our portfolio of solutions and integrate powerful capabilities — such as built-in data analytics, payment services and tailored user experiences — to bring even greater value and performance to our customers.
During 2018, we made several portfolio announcements, ranging from solution integrations to new capabilities for existing solutions to new solution introductions. We introduced our Cloud Solution for Faith Communities, which combines our proven strength in financial management, fundraising, marketing, payments and analytics with our completely new Church Management capabilities. With this move, we now will provide integrated end-to-end cloud capabilities that enable churches to digitally transform their operations through a single connected experience. We also announced our Cloud Solution for Higher Education, introducing a new Education Management portfolio, along with stewardship management and guided fundraising capabilities tailored for higher education. This new cloud solution will enable customers to manage the complete student life cycle, from admissions to alumni engagement, student enrollment, classroom scheduling and a student information system. We also announced the Integrated Cloud Initiative for Nonprofits, a joint investment with Microsoft to accelerate cloud innovation in areas that address critical market needs across the mission life cycle of nonprofits. As part of this initiative, we are jointly developing a solution called Nonprofit Resource Management, which is a breakthrough in helping nonprofits effectively source, track, distribute and measure the impact of their resources across core business processes for managing the distribution of everything from material goods to financial and human capital.

2. | Drive Sales Effectiveness

We are making investments to increase the effectiveness of our sales organization, with a focus on enabling our expanding sales teams with the talent, processes and tools to accelerate our revenue growth and improve effectiveness. Our sales teams are now managed on a common sales operating model. This model, which is driving increased productivity, includes common procedures, training, key operating metrics, compensation plans and reporting. Our sales account executives now lead with a total-solution selling strategy by vertical, focused on recurring revenue and driving more products per customer, higher ASPs and increased customer retention over the long-term. We believe that attaching training, analytics and payments improves the cloud experience, drives customer outcomes, improves retention and increases customer lifetime value. We continue to innovate and acquire solutions that create greater value for our customers. We spent the second half of 2018 ramping our direct sales hiring resulting in an increase in sales headcount of 19% since the end of 2017. We expect to continue making similar investments during 2019 and beyond. These incremental investments are intended to address the large market opportunity that we see for ourselves and fuel future revenue growth. Also, our partnership with Microsoft is gaining momentum with Microsoft introducing us to new joint-selling opportunities.

3. | Expand TAM into Near Adjacencies with Acquisitions and Product Investments

We will continue to evaluate compelling opportunities to acquire companies and acquire or build technologies and services. We will be guided by our acquisition criteria for considering attractive assets that expand our TAM, provide entry into new and near adjacencies, accelerate our shift to the cloud, accelerate revenue growth, are accretive to margins and present synergistic opportunities. 
In 2018, we announced our Cloud Solution for Faith Communities, our expanded Cloud Solution for Higher Education and the Integrated Cloud Initiative for Nonprofits, demonstrating that we are now in a position to organically build and not just acquire incremental TAM. These solution introductions added approximately $2 billion to our TAM.

2018 Form 10-K

Blackbaud, Inc.

We also acquired Reeher in the second quarter of 2018 to bolster our extensive performance benchmarking capabilities. In addition, our recent acquisition of YourCause, which closed on the first business day in January 2019, added another half-billion dollars to our TAM. Our TAM now stands at over $10 billion.

4. | Improve Operating Efficiency

We continue driving towards a more scalable operating model that creates efficiency and consistency in how we execute through infrastructure investments, productivity initiatives, and organizational re-alignments. Our organizational model, which we have evolved over the past few years, is largely complete and allows us to gain efficiency and consistency in how we execute. We have centralized our operations, including marketing, sustained engineering, product management, finance, customer support, customer success and professional services, which allows us to better manage the entire customer experience. We also created an operational excellence function inside of Blackbaud that focuses on maximizing the effectiveness of the business through continuous improvement.
In 2018, we continued executing against a cohesive workplace strategy in an effort to improve operating efficiency and further our organizational objectives, with our geographically diverse workforce. We also furthered our efforts to relocate some of our existing offices to highly modern and more collaborative workspaces with short-term financial commitments. These workspaces are more centrally located for our employees and closer to our customers. Our aim is optimizing our office utilization, improving our geographic sales coverage, and enhancing our employees' daily experience to improve productivity and effectiveness. We have continued this initiative into 2019 and expect to be largely complete by the end of this year.
We have also begun near-shoring certain functions such as customer operations and support on a selective basis to Costa Rica, enabling efficient resource investment to support our growing business.
Attract Top Talent and Actively Engage Employee Base
Our customers' passion is our purpose, and we have incredible customers whose missions make the world a better place for all of us. Driven by this purpose, our employees come to work every day knowing that they can make a real difference with our customers and thus, the world. Collaboration, innovation and high standards are core to our culture and help to enable the great work we do. We strive to hire the best employees and provide a workplace where their talents and potential are realized. Our employees' engagement is a focus of every leader at Blackbaud, and we continually work to understand what matters and to make our workplace better. We believe people with a passion for purpose can have a unique and fulfilling career experience on our team. Our leaders are committed to our employees' personal and career development and continually work to improve the training and tools provided to their teams.    
Build our Reputation as an Industry Thought Leader 
In our 37 years of experience in the philanthropic market, we have gained significant insight into the overall market and industry segments in which we operate. We produce a wide range of thought leadership materials, including blogs, monthly indices and white papers, which provide insights and guidance to the social good community. We also participate in a number of industry forums, where we exchange views and engage with industry and government leaders. Our annual user conference, bbcon™, is used in part as a forum to offer thought leadership to our customers, as are other market specific user conferences such as our annual K-12 conference. We intend to expand these activities and further build our reputation as a thought leader within the industry. Additionally, the Blackbaud Institute for Philanthropic Impact brings together the best minds in philanthropy to develop and share leading-edge research and insight that accelerates the impact of the social good community. The research and reports the Blackbaud Institute produces serve to strengthen the social good community as a whole.

Our analytics offerings include subscription solutions and services within the following areas: 
Donor Acquisition - Our donor acquisition solutions leverage unique data assets to create acquisition mailing lists and predictive models that identify donor populations that meet the affinity, value and response criteria of our nonprofit customers. Nonprofit organizations use our prospect lists to solicit gifts and other support.
Prospect Research - Our prospect research solutions include: custom data modeling that delivers critical information on a prospect's likelihood to make a gift to an organization; wealth screenings that deliver detailed wealth information and giving capacity data on prospects; and web-based prospect management software that combines public data with donor information from a nonprofit's database to build a complete view of prospects for targeting and securing gifts.

educators, publishers, financial service providers, complementary technology providers and data providers. These companies promote or complement our solutions and provide us access to new customers.
Corporate Philanthropy and Volunteerism
Blackbaud operates under a fundamental belief that the world would be better if good took over. The company is an active participant in the ecosystem of good, working to drive positive change both through what we do as a business and how we serve individually. We offer an array of philanthropy programs aimed at engaging our employees as agents of good, including matching gifts, competitive grants that honor excellent examples of volunteerism, employee-led grants committees, skills-based volunteerism initiatives, as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics focused community programs. Blackbaud attracts people who are committed to service, with 87% saying our focus on nonprofits was a driver in their decision to join the company, 84% actively serving as volunteers and 23% serving on a nonprofit board or committee.
Competition
The market for software and related services in the philanthropic industry is competitive and highly fragmented. For certain areas of the market, entry barriers are low, as general tools for small businesses can usually be configured to manage the most basic marketing, contact management, and accounting needs of social good organizations. In parallel, as software development evolves from a highly-complex tradecraft with nuanced understanding of architectural patterns and discrete languages, to click-to-code and drag-and-drop development with natively cloud-based infrastructure, it becomes easier for competitors to quickly spin up basic applications with embedded security and functionality. However, once basic needs are met, programs unique to social good organizations like fundraising, gift and grant management, and peer-to-peer activism require highly specialized tools to configure and transform general business software to match the complexities of the industry. These specialized applications have a higher barrier of entry as they require industry insight to accurately articulate the business workflow that generates the requirements that are translated into code for software products. Moreover, because social good organizations rely heavily on relationships with and among their supporters, integration of systems drives value beyond mere efficiency. Hence, we believe our insight, the full spectrum of our current solutions and our ability to deliver on future solutions makes us a strong competitor. We expect to continue to see new entrants as focus on social investment solutions increases to satisfy Millennials and Gen Z donors, the barriers of entry continue to decline with natively cloud-based solutions, and social good organizations rely intrinsically on technology to manage emerging revenue channels and increasingly complex operations.
Our competition falls into four primary categories: (1) niche products that are tailored to specialized needs; (2) vertical-specific solutions; (3) general business software that can be configured to manage some nonprofit-specific processes; and (4) consumer-oriented fundraising platforms.
Niche products are usually developed as a solution for a single problem at an organization and are adopted by similar organizations to solve a specialized need. These are typically offered by vendors who may have deep industry expertise but may not have the resources to expand beyond a specialized area. We believe we compete against these solutions by offering a set of integrated solutions rather than a single point solution, which we believe improves the overall customer experience. In addition, our open platform allows integration to specialized applications so the opportunity for disruption from these competitors is minimized.
Vertical-specific solutions are offered by competitors seeking to meet the enterprise-wide needs of a specific sub-segment of social good community. Typically, these solutions are offered by vendors who may offer either a point solution or integrated suite of products used by a vertical. We believe we compete successfully against these competitors through a combination of our integrated suite of offerings within verticals where we compete, offering solutions with market leading robustness as well as the scale, reach, and reputation of our organization.
General business software vendors such as Salesforce.com and Oracle, compete with us in certain areas of our business. While there is a growing trend toward social investment that is prompting philanthropic solutions for these general business vendors, most do not have complete nonprofit specific focus and, therefore, do not offer or intend to offer nonprofit-specific versions for outside sales. However, there is a subset of general business software competitors who have introduced nonprofit-specific versions of their products. These products generally do not satisfy the needs of nonprofits from end-to-end as they were not designed to support the specific needs of nonprofits during the original architecture, design, and requirements elicitation phases; therefore, we believe that because these products were not originally designed for

nonprofits, they are not yet capable of meeting market needs without significant customization. The significant customization required to transform general business products into nonprofit solutions often requires the use of consultants to guide the implementation, without which, leave the adoption of general business software limited to very basic operations and simple needs. We believe our solutions compete successfully against general business software as a nonprofit’s needs grow more complex. As a result, we believe we can compete successfully to meet nonprofit-specific requirements, often integrating with general business platforms used for their more generalized operations.
Consumer-oriented fundraising platforms such as GoFundMe, Virgin Money Giving, and Facebook compete with our business where consumers raise funds directly. To drive adoption of their platforms, these vendors rely on a combination of direct-to-consumer marketing, marketing to nonprofits who in turn market to their supporters, and marketing to intermediate entities such as an event sponsor who will market to participants. We believe we compete well in this market through a combination of positive brand recognition among all three of these groups and the strength of our consumer-oriented tools relative to those of the competition.
Less frequently, we compete with providers of traditional, non-automated fundraising service providers, including parties providing services in support of traditional direct mail or email campaigns, special events fundraising, peer to peer, telemarketing and personal solicitations. We believe we compete successfully against these traditional fundraising service providers, primarily because our solutions and services are more automated, more robust, more tailored to the needs of nonprofit organization and more efficient.
