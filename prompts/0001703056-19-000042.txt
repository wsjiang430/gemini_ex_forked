ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Our Company
We are a leading provider of monitored security and interactive home and business automation solutions in the United States (or “U.S.”) and Canada. Our mission is to help our customers protect and connect to what matters most—their families, homes, and businesses. The ADT brand is synonymous with security and, as the most recognized and trusted brand in the industry, is a key driver of our success. We currently serve approximately 7.2 million customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned, making us one of the largest companies of our kind in the U.S. and Canada. We are also one of the largest full-service companies with a national footprint providing both residential and commercial monitored security. We deliver an integrated customer experience by maintaining one of the industry’s largest sales, installation, and service field forces, as well as a 24/7 professional monitoring network, all supported by approximately 19,000 employees. We handle approximately 15 million alarms annually. We provide support from approximately 240 sales and service locations and through our 12 monitoring centers listed by Underwriters Laboratories (“U.L.”) in the U.S. and Canada.
Our Formation
On July 1, 2015, we consummated two acquisitions that were instrumental in the formation of our company. First, we acquired Protection One (“Protection One Acquisition”). Second, on July 1, 2015, we acquired ASG (“ASG Acquisition” and collectively with the Protection One Acquisition, referred to as the “Formation Transactions”). Prior to the Formation Transactions, ADT Inc. was a holding company with no assets or liabilities. Protection One is the predecessor of ADT Inc. for accounting purposes.
On May 2, 2016, we acquired The ADT Corporation (“ADT Acquisition”). The ADT Acquisition significantly increased our market share in the security industry making us one of the largest monitored security companies in the U.S. and Canada. 
All of the aforementioned acquisitions were funded by a combination of equity invested by certain investment funds directly or indirectly affiliated with or managed by our Sponsor and new and/or assumed borrowings. In addition, concurrently with the consummation of the ADT Acquisition, ADT Inc. issued 750,000 shares of Series A preferred securities (“Koch Preferred Securities”) and Ultimate Parent issued 7,620,730 detachable warrants for the purchase of Class A-1 Units in Ultimate Parent to an affiliate of Koch Industries, Inc. (“Koch Investor”) for an aggregate amount in cash of $750 million.
On January 23, 2018, we consummated an initial public offering of 105,000,000 shares of our common stock at an initial public offering price of $14.00 per share pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-222233), which was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 18, 2018 (“IPO” or the “Initial Offering”). The aggregate gross proceeds from the IPO were approximately $1,406 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. In February 2018, we used approximately $649 million of the proceeds to redeem $594 million aggregate principal amount of the 9.250% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (“Prime Notes”) and to pay the related call premium. On July 2, 2018, we used approximately $949 million of proceeds from the IPO and cash on hand to redeem in full the original stated value of $750 million of the Koch Preferred Securities and pay approximately $103 million related to the redemption premium and tax reimbursements, as well as $96 million related to the accumulated dividend obligation on the Koch Preferred Securities (“Koch Redemption”). The remaining proceeds from the IPO were used to pay IPO related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion.
As of December 31, 2018, our Sponsor owned approximately 84.7% of our outstanding common stock, which excludes unvested common shares. 
Information about Segment and Geographic Revenue
We report financial and operating information in one segment. Our operating segment is also our reportable segment. For the results of our operations outside of the U.S., which consist of our operations in Canada, refer to Note 15 “Geographic Data” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.

Brands and Services
ADT is among the most respected, trusted, and well-known brands in the monitored security industry, and we operate a number of other industry leading brands under our portfolio. The strength of our brands is built upon a long-standing record of providing high-quality and reliable monitored security services and commitment to superior customer care and service expertise. In addition, we offer interactive technologies that add automation capabilities to our traditional monitored security systems. We also seek opportunities that allow us to leverage our brand names as well as focus on security and trust among our customer base to expand our service offerings to help our customers protect and connect to what matters most. Due to the importance that customers place on reputation and trust when purchasing monitored security, we believe the strength of our brands is a key competitive advantage and contributor to our success.
Our monitored security and automation offerings involve the installation and monitoring of security and premises automation systems designed to detect intrusion; control access; sense movement, smoke, fire, carbon monoxide, flooding, temperature, and other environmental conditions and hazards; and address personal emergencies such as injuries, medical emergencies, or incapacitation. Upon the occurrence of certain initiating events, our monitored security systems send event-specific signals to our monitoring centers. Our monitoring center personnel respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information to local police or fire departments and notifying the customer or others on the customer’s emergency contact list according to the type of service contract and customer preference. Additional action may be taken by our monitoring center personnel as needed depending on the specific situation and customer preferences. The breadth of our solutions allows us to meet a wide variety of customer needs.
Additionally, using our interactive technologies, our customers can remotely monitor and manage their residential and commercial environments by adding automation capabilities to our monitored security systems. This is accomplished in a way that maintains the separate network integrity and redundancy of a customer’s security signals. Depending on the service plan purchased and the type and level of product installation, customers are able to remotely access information regarding the security of their residential or commercial environment, arm and disarm their security system, adjust lighting or thermostat levels, or view real-time video from cameras covering different areas of their premises from web-enabled devices (such as smart phones, laptops, and tablet computers) and a customized web portal. Additionally, our interactive automation solutions enable customers to create customized schedules or automation for managing lights, thermostats, appliances, and garage doors. The system can also be programmed to perform additional functions such as recording and viewing live video and sending text messages based on triggering events. 
As part of our innovative and dynamic growth markets, our goal is to extend the concept of security from the physical home or business to cybersecurity and personal on-the-go security and safety. Customers’ increasingly mobile and active lifestyles have created new opportunities for us in the fast-growing market for self-monitored and do-it-yourself (“DIY”) products and services. Our technology also allows us to service our customers via various connected and wearable devices whether they are at home or on-the-go.
Many of our residential customers are driven to purchase monitored security and automation services due to a perceived or actual increase in crime, life safety concerns in their neighborhood, or other significant life events. In addition, we believe many of our customers purchase monitored security and automation services as a result of their insurance carriers, who may offer lower insurance premium rates if a security system is installed or may require that a system be installed as a condition of coverage.
Reasons for purchasing monitored security and automation systems vary for our commercial customers. Most commercial customers require a basic security system for insurance purposes. However, as internet protocol (“IP”) video solutions have become more affordable and interactive, businesses view these solutions for applications beyond just security and leverage them for operational purposes as well, including employee safety, theft prevention, and inventory management. In addition, certain commercial premises are required to install and maintain fire alarm and, in some cases, fire suppression systems to meet the requirements under applicable building codes and insurance policies.
Some of our customers use traditional land-line telephone service as the primary communication method for alarm signals from their sites. As the use of land-line telephone service has decreased, the ability to provide alternative communication methods from a customer’s security control panel to our central monitoring centers has become increasingly important. We currently offer, and recommend, a variety of alternative primary and back-up alarm transmission methods, including cellular and broadband Internet.
Additionally, we offer personal emergency response system products and services, which are supported by our monitoring centers and leverage our security monitoring infrastructure to provide customers with solutions helping to sustain independent living and encourage better self-care activities. 
In addition to monitoring services, we provide our residential and commercial customers with other services such as routine maintenance and the installation of upgraded or additional equipment. A majority of our customer base is enrolled in a service plan, which provides additional value to the customer and generates incremental recurring monthly revenue. Our customers 
 3

typically contract for both monitoring and maintenance services at the time of initial equipment installation. In certain markets, we also sell, install, integrate, maintain, and inspect commercial building safety and management technologies including fire detection, fire suppression, video surveillance, and access control systems for both new and existing commercial premises.
Our monitoring and maintenance services provided to our customers are generally governed by multi-year contracts with automatic renewal provisions providing us with recurring monthly revenue. Under our typical customer contract, the customer pays an upfront fee and is then obligated to make monthly payments for the remainder of the initial contract term. In the residential market, the standard contract term is three years (two years in California), with automatic renewals for successive 30-day periods, unless canceled by either party. In the commercial market, the standard contract term is typically five years with various automatic renewals with terms ranging from 30-day periods to one year. If a customer cancels or is otherwise in default under the contract prior to the end of the initial contract term, we have the right under the contract to receive a termination payment from the customer in an amount equal to a designated percentage of all remaining monthly payments. Monitoring services are generally billed monthly or quarterly in advance. More than 70% of our residential customers pay us through automated payment methods, with new residential customers generally opting for these payment methods. We periodically adjust the standard monthly monitoring rate charged to new and existing customers.
Our Markets
We operate in the following three markets: Residential, Commercial, and Growth Markets.

• | Residential: Our residential market primarily consists of owners of single-family homes who have purchased monitored security and automation services as a result of having moved to a new residence, in response to changes in the perceived threat of crime or life safety concerns in their neighborhood, or in conjunction with other significant life events, such as the birth of a child.


• | Commercial: Our commercial market ranges from smaller businesses to large single-site commercial facilities, as well as multi-site national companies. The market is characterized by higher penetration rates, driven in part by fire and building codes and insurance requirements, and by a higher degree of complexity with respect to system installations. 


• | Growth Markets: Our growth markets, which include new customer types and new offerings, present opportunities for us to leverage our brand names, our core focus on security, and our high degree of trust among our customer base to pursue complementary markets such as smart home technologies, network and cybersecurity, and personal on-the-go security and safety. We also leverage our security monitoring infrastructure to provide customers with solutions that help sustain independent living and encourage better self-care activities. 

Customers and Marketing
We serve approximately 7.2 million customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned, throughout the U.S. and Canada. Our residential customers are typically owners of single-family homes. Our commercial customers include retail businesses, food and beverage service providers, medical offices, financial institutions, and professional service providers, among others, and can range from smaller businesses to large single-site commercial facilities, as well as multi-site national companies. We manage our existing customer base to maximize customer lifetime value, which includes continually evaluating our product offerings, pricing, and service strategies; managing our costs to provide service to customers; upgrading existing customers to our interactive services, IP video solutions for businesses, or other upgraded solutions; and achieving long customer tenure. Our ability to increase our average selling prices for individual customers is dependent on a number of factors including the quality of our service as well as our continued introduction of additional features and services that increase the value of our offerings to customers and the competitive environment in which we operate. 
To support the growth of our customer base and to improve awareness of our brands, we market our monitored security and automation systems and services through national television, radio, and direct mail advertisements, as well as through Internet advertising, including national search engine marketing, email, online video, local search, and social media. We continually work to optimize our marketing spend through a lead modeling process, whereby we dynamically allocate our marketing spend based on lead flow and measured marketing channel effectiveness. In addition to traditional and digital marketing, we have several affinity partnerships with organizations that promote our services to their customer bases. 
We continually consider and evaluate new customer lead generation methods and channels to increase our customer base and drive greater market penetration without sacrificing customer quality. We also explore opportunities to expand our market presence by providing branded solutions through various third parties, including insurance companies, financial institutions, retailers, public utilities, and software service providers.

Sales and Distribution Channels
We utilize a complementary mix of direct and indirect distribution channels. Our direct channel customers are generated by our direct response marketing efforts and supported by our internal sales force, including our national call center and in-market field teams. Our indirect channel customers are generated mainly through our ADT Authorized Dealer Program (as defined below), and to a smaller extent, through agreements with leading homebuilders and related partners. As opportunities arise, we may also engage in selective bulk account purchases, which typically involve the purchase of a set of customer accounts from other security service providers.
New customers for monitored security and automation services typically require us to make an upfront investment, consisting primarily of installation costs, including direct materials and labor, direct and indirect sales costs, marketing costs, and administrative costs related to the installation activities, which are partially offset by fees received in connection with the initiation of a monitoring contract. While the economics of our installation business can vary depending on the customer acquisition channel, we operate our business with the goal of retaining customers for long periods of time to recoup our initial investment in new customers, generally achieving revenue break-even in less than three years.
Direct Channel
Our national sales call centers (inbound and outbound) close sales from prospective customers generated through national marketing efforts and lead generation channel partners. Our telephone sales associates work to understand customer needs and then direct customers to the most suitable sales approach. We make attempts to close a sale over the phone while balancing the opportunity for up-sales and customer education that occurs when a sales representative works directly with the customer. When the sale is best handled in the customer’s home or business to fully understand their individual needs, the sales center associate can schedule a field sales consultant appointment.
The approximately 3,100 sales consultants that make up our field sales force generate sales from customers through company-generated leads, as well as customer referrals and other lead methods. Our field sales consultants undergo an in-depth screening process prior to hire. Each field sales consultant completes comprehensive centralized training prior to conducting customer sales presentations and participates in ongoing training in support of new offerings and the use of our structured model sales call. We utilize a highly structured sales approach, which includes, in addition to the structured model sales call, daily monitoring of sales activity and effectiveness metrics and regular coaching by our sales management teams.
Indirect Channel
We have agreements with a network of third-party independent alarm dealers who sell alarm equipment and ADT Authorized Dealer-branded monitoring and interactive services to end users (“ADT Authorized Dealer Program”). The dealers in this program generate new end-user contracts which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from the dealer. Our authorized dealer network consists of approximately 250 authorized dealers operating across the U.S. and Canada and extends our reach by aligning us with select independent security sales and installation companies. These authorized dealers generally have exclusivity arrangements with us for security-related services. We monitor each authorized dealer’s financial stability, use of sound and ethical business practices, and delivery of reliable and consistent high-quality sales and installation methods. Authorized dealers are required to adhere to the same high-quality standards for sales and installation as our own field offices.
Typically, our authorized dealers are contractually obligated to offer exclusively to us all qualified security service accounts they generate, but we are not obligated to accept these accounts. We pay our authorized dealers for the acquisition of any qualified monitored accounts from them. In certain instances in which we reject an account, we generally still indirectly provide monitoring services for that account through a monitoring services agreement with the authorized dealer. Like our direct sales contracts, dealer generated customer contracts typically have an initial term of three years with automatic renewals for successive 30-day periods, unless canceled by either party. If an accepted security services account is canceled during the charge-back period, which is generally twelve to fifteen months, the dealer is required to provide an account with equivalent economic characteristics or to refund our payment of the purchase price for the canceled account.
Field Operations
We serve our customer base from approximately 240 sales and service offices located throughout the U.S. and Canada. From these locations, our staff of approximately 5,600 installation and service technicians provides monitored security and automation system installations and on-premises service and repair. We staff our field offices to efficiently and effectively make sales calls, install systems, and provide service support based on customer needs and our evaluation of growth opportunities in each market. We utilize third-party subcontract labor when appropriate to assist with these efforts. We maintain the relevant and necessary licenses related to the provision of installation of security and related services in the jurisdictions in which we operate. 
 5

Our objective is to provide a differentiated service experience by providing same-day or next-day service to the majority of our customers.
Monitoring Centers and Support Services
We operate 12 monitoring centers that are listed by U.L. across the U.S. and Canada. We employ approximately 4,200 customer care professionals who are required to complete extensive initial training, as well as receive ongoing training and coaching. To obtain and maintain a U.L. listing, a security system monitoring center must be located in a building meeting U.L.’s structural requirements, have back-up computer and power systems, and meet U.L. specifications for staffing and standard operating procedures. Many jurisdictions have laws requiring that security systems for certain buildings be monitored by U.L.-listed centers. In addition, a U.L. listing is required by insurers of certain customers as a condition of insurance coverage. Our monitoring centers are fully redundant, which means that in the event of an emergency at one of our monitoring centers such as fire, tornado, major interruption in telephone or computer service, or any other event affecting the functionality of the center, all monitoring operations can be automatically transferred to another monitoring center. All of our monitoring centers operate 24 hours a day on a year-round basis.
We serve our largest multi-site customers from our National Accounts Operation Center (“NAOC”) in Irving, Texas. Our multi-site customers call one location to resolve all support issues, including billing, installations, service calls, upgrades, or other service-related assistance. This concept is unique in our industry and is a strong selling point for national accounts choosing us for their security needs. 
Newark, Delaware is home to our Network Operations Center (“NOC”). The NOC houses a group of highly experienced certified engineers capable of designing and provisioning broadband networks for our customers. These employees are Cisco Certified and Meraki Certified, and our NOC earned the Cisco Cloud and Managed Services Express Partner Certification, which makes us one of the few security companies in the industry with this designation.
Three of our monitoring centers provide monitoring under the CMS brand, which provides outsourced monitoring services related to contracts monitored but not owned.
Customer Care
We believe the fastest and most profitable way to grow our company is by keeping the customers we already have. To maintain our high standard of customer service, we provide ongoing, high-quality training to call center and field employees and our authorized dealers. We also continually measure and monitor key performance metrics that drive a high-value customer experience, including customer satisfaction-oriented metrics across each customer touch point.
Our call center operations provide support 24 hours a day on a year-round basis. Customer care specialists answer non-emergency inquiries regarding service, billing, and alarm testing and support, while our monitoring centers primarily handle inbound alarms and dispatch of alarms. To ensure technical service requests are handled promptly and professionally, all requests are routed through our customer contact centers. Customer care specialists help customers resolve minor service and operating issues and, in many cases, the specialists can remotely resolve customer concerns. We continue to implement new customer-facing self-service tools via interactive voice response systems and the Internet, thereby providing customers additional choices in managing their services.
Suppliers
We purchase equipment and components of our products from a limited number of suppliers and distributors. Inventory is held in our regional distribution centers at levels we believe are sufficient to meet current and anticipated customer needs. We also maintain inventory of equipment and components at each field office and in technicians’ vehicles. Generally, our third-party distributors maintain a minimum stocking level of certain key items to cover supply chain disruptions. We also utilize dual sourcing methods to minimize the risk of a disruption from any single supplier. We do not anticipate any major interruptions in our supply chain.
Competition
Technology trends are creating significant change in our industry. Innovation has lowered the barriers to entry in the interactive services and automation market, and new business models and competitors have emerged. We believe a combination of increasing customer interest in lifestyle and business productivity and technology advancements will support the increasing penetration of the interactive services and automation industry. We are focused on extending our leadership position in the monitored security industry while also growing our share of the fast-growing interactive automation industry. The security systems market 
 6

in the U.S. and Canada remains highly competitive and fragmented, with a number of major firms and thousands of smaller regional and local companies. The high fragmentation of the industry is primarily the result of relatively low barriers to entering the business in local geographies and the availability of companies providing outsourced monitoring services but not maintaining the customer relationship. We believe our principal competitors within the security systems market are Johnson Controls International plc.; Vivint, Inc.; Stanley Security Solutions, a subsidiary of Stanley Black and Decker; MONI, a subsidiary of Ascent Capital Group, Inc.; Comcast Corporation; Convergint Technologies; and Securitas. In addition, as more and more homeowners choose DIY products over professionally installed and monitored security and automation solutions, and as we expand our presence in this market space, we believe we will face increasing competition from providers and products such as SimpliSafe, Google Home, Nest, Apple Homekit, Amazon Alexa, Ring, as well as many others. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We sell our products and services in highly competitive markets, including the home automation market and the commercial fire and security markets, which may result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products and services” for further discussion regarding increasing competition in the emerging DIY market.
Success in acquiring new customers is dependent on a variety of factors, including brand and reputation, market visibility, service and product capabilities, quality, price, and the ability to identify and sell to prospective customers. Competition is often based primarily on price in relation to the value of the solutions and service. Rather than compete purely on price, we emphasize the quality of our services, which we believe is distinguished by superior customer service, the reputation of our industry-leading brands, our owned and operated monitoring centers, our commitment to consumer privacy, and our knowledge of customer needs, which we believe collectively enable us to deliver an outstanding experience. In addition, we are increasingly offering added features and functionality, such as those in our interactive services offering, which provide new services and capabilities that serve to further differentiate our offering and support a pricing premium.
We believe our focus on safety, security, and pricing, coupled with our nationwide team of in-home sales consultants, our solid reputation for and expertise in providing reliable security and monitoring services through our in-house network of redundant monitoring centers, our reliable product solutions, and our highly skilled installation and service organization, position us well to compete with traditional and new competitors.
Seasonality
Our business experiences a certain level of seasonality. Since more household moves take place during the second and third calendar quarters of each year, our disconnect rate and new customer additions are typically higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters. There is also a slight seasonal effect on our new customer installation volume and related cash expenses incurred in investments in new customers; however, other factors such as the level of marketing expense and relevant promotional offers can mitigate the effects of seasonality. In addition, we may see increased servicing costs related to higher alarm signals and customer service requests as a result of customer power outages and other issues due to weather-related incidents.
Intellectual Property
Patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other proprietary rights are important to our business; thus, we continuously refine our intellectual property strategy to maintain and improve our competitive position. We register new intellectual property to protect our ongoing technological innovations and strengthen our brand, and we take appropriate action against infringements or misappropriations of our intellectual property rights by others. We review third-party intellectual property rights to help avoid infringement and to identify strategic opportunities. We typically enter into confidentiality agreements to further protect our intellectual property.
We own a portfolio of patents and patent applications that relate to a variety of monitored security and automation technologies utilized in our business, including security panels and sensors as well as video and information management solutions. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and trademark applications in the U.S. and Canada, including, but not limited to, ADT, ADT Pulse, ADT Always There, Protection 1, and Protectron. Our brands are critical to our business due to the importance customers place on reputation and trust when deciding on a security provider. In addition, we are a licensee of intellectual property, including from our third-party suppliers and technology partners. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are typically dependent upon the use of the trademarks.
Certain trademarks associated with the ADT brand, including “ADT” and the blue octagon, are owned outside of the U.S. and Canada by Johnson Controls International plc (as successor to Tyco International Ltd., “Tyco”). In certain instances, such trademarks are licensed in certain territories outside the U.S. and Canada by Johnson Controls International plc to certain third parties. Pursuant to the Tyco Trademark Agreement entered into between The ADT Corporation and Tyco in connection with the 
 7

separation of The ADT Corporation from Tyco in 2012, our Company is generally prohibited from registering, attempting to register, or using such trademarks outside the U.S. and its territories and Canada. As a result, if our Company chooses to sell products or services or otherwise do business outside the U.S. and Canada, it does not have the right to use the ADT brand to promote its products and services. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Third parties hold rights to certain key brand names outside of the U.S. and Canada” for further discussion.
Government Regulation and Other Regulatory Matters
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and Canada in areas including consumer protection, occupational licensing, building codes, environmental protection, labor and employment, tax, and permitting. Most states and provinces in which we operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the monitored security industry. In certain jurisdictions, we must obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing employee selection, training, and business conduct. 
We also currently rely extensively upon the use of both wireline and wireless telecommunications to communicate signals, and wireline and wireless telephone companies in the U.S. and Canada are regulated by federal, state, provincial, and local governments. The operation and use of wireless telephone and radio frequencies is regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and state public utilities commissions and in Canada by the Canada Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (“CRTC”). Although the use of wireline phone service has been decreasing, we believe we are well positioned to respond to these trends with alternate transmission methods that we already employ, including cellular and broadband Internet technologies. Our advertising and sales practices are regulated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Canadian Competition Bureau, the CRTC, and state and provincial consumer protection laws. In addition, we are subject to certain administrative requirements and laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations may include restrictions on the manner in which we promote the sale of our security services and require us to provide most purchasers of our services with three-day or longer rescission rights. We must also comply with applicable laws governing telemarketing and email marketing in both the United Stated and Canada. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Increasing government regulation of telemarketing, email marketing, door-to-door sales, and other marketing methods may increase our costs and restrict the operation and growth of our business” for further discussion. 
Some local government authorities have adopted or are considering various measures aimed at reducing false alarms. Such measures include requiring permits for individual alarm systems, revoking such permits following a specified number of false alarms, imposing fines on customers or alarm monitoring companies for false alarms, limiting the number of times police will respond to alarms at a particular location after a specified number of false alarms, requiring additional verification of an alarm signal before the police respond, or providing no response to residential system alarms. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We could be assessed penalties for false alarms” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Police departments could refuse to respond to calls from monitored security service companies” for further discussion. 
 The monitored security industry is also subject to requirements, codes, and standards imposed by various insurance, approval and listing, and standards organizations. Depending upon the type of customer, security service provided, and requirements of the applicable local governmental jurisdiction, adherence to the requirements, codes, and standards of such organizations is mandatory in some instances and voluntary in others. Changes in laws and regulations can affect our operations, both positively and negatively, and impact the manner in which we conduct our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our business operates in a regulated industry” for further discussion.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 19,000 people. Approximately 10% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relations with our employees and labor unions have generally been good.
