Our Business
 Heritage Insurance Holdings, Inc., (“we”, “our”, “us” and “Heritage Insurance”), established in 2012 and incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2014, is a property and casualty insurance holding company that provides personal and commercial residential property insurance. We are headquartered in Clearwater, Florida and, through our insurance company subsidiaries, Heritage Property & Casualty Insurance Company (“Heritage P&C”), Narragansett Bay Insurance Company (“NBIC”) and Zephyr Insurance Company (“Zephyr”), we write personal residential property insurance for single-family homeowners and condominium owners, and rental property insurance in the states of Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island and South Carolina. We also provide commercial residential insurance for Florida properties and are also licensed in the states of Maryland, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. We are vertically integrated and control or manage substantially all aspects of insurance underwriting, customer service, actuarial analysis, distribution and claims processing and adjusting. We are led by an experienced senior management team with an average of 25 years of insurance industry experience. 
 Our financial strength ratings are important to the Company in establishing our competitive position and can impact our ability to write policies. We are rated by both Demotech, Inc. (“Demotech”) and Kroll Bond Rating Agency (“KBRA”). Demotech, a rating agency specializing in evaluating the financial stability of insurers, maintains a letter-scale financial stability rating system (“FSR”) from A’’ (A double prime) to L (licensed by insurance regulatory authorities). KBRA assigned an investment grade issuer rating to the Company and assigned insurance financial strength rating (“IFSR”) to our insurance company subsidiaries. The rating assigned to insurance companies ranges from AAA (extremely strong operations to no risk) to R (operating under regulatory supervision). 
 Demotech and KBRA have assigned the following IFSR to our key operating subsidiaries. Additionally, KBRA has assigned an investment grade issuer rating to us. The outlook for all ratings is stable.

The following chart depicts our organizational structure:
 

Our Company
 Our primary products are personal and commercial residential property insurance, which at December 31, 2018 were offered in Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island and South Carolina. Our Florida domiciled insurance company, Heritage P&C, is authorized by each of the respective state insurance departments in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina and South Carolina. Our Hawaii domiciled insurance company, Zephyr, writes business only in Hawaii and is authorized by the Hawaii Insurance Division. Our Rhode Island domiciled insurance company, NBIC, is authorized by each of the respective state insurance departments in Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia. We conduct our operations under one business segment.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 512,793 personal residential policies in force, representing $840.9 million of annualized premium and approximately 3,000 commercial residential policies in force, representing $82.7 million of annualized premium for a total number of policies and annualized premium of 515,686 and $923.7 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had gross premiums written of $923.3 million, $625.5 million, and $626.7 million, respectively and operating income of $69.5 million, $49.5 million, and $56.8 million respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had total assets of $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and total stockholders’ equity of $425.3 million and $379.8 million, respectively.
 Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to grow and geographically diversify our property insurance operations to achieve consistent positive results for our shareholders while mitigating the risk from a single or series of catastrophic weather events. This diversification also serves to enhance our supply of risk transfer partners and optimize reinsurance pricing. We began insurance operations in Florida through selective assumptions of business from Citizens, expanded our Florida business to include commercial and voluntary business, expanded our Florida insurance company to multiple new states, and through mergers and acquisitions we have expanded operations to Hawaii and the northeastern United States. We intend to continue to grow profitably by undertaking the following:
 Improve the Profitability of our Florida Portfolio 
 Our Florida book of business has evolved to include commercial residential business and expansion of the voluntary personal lines business. While we have significantly expanded our Florida marketing efforts, our goal is also to improve the profitability of our Florida personal lines business by enhancing product offerings while carefully underwriting the risk and ensuring product rate adequacy. The claims environment in South Florida has resulted in an escalation of water claims for which the severity has increased due to Assignment of Benefits (“AOB”). We have taken underwriting and rate actions to improve the profitability of our South Florida business. Our total insured value for personal lines business in Dade and Broward counties decreased year over year by 16.7%. Our Florida market share expanded through strategic opportunities to acquire profitable business from private insurers such as Sunshine State Insurance Company in 2014 and Sawgrass Mutual Insurance Company in 2017.

Optimize Our Reinsurance Program 
 We continue to strategically evaluate our reinsurance program to obtain what we believe to be the most appropriate levels and sources of reinsurance. Our reinsurance program includes excess loss, quota share, per risk and facultative reinsurance. We believe there is sufficient capital to support our reinsurance program and that we have an opportunity to obtain favorable pricing and contract terms and conditions, including multi-year commitments on our catastrophe bond program. With the exclusion of 2018, we entered into fully collateralized multi-year catastrophe reinsurance agreements funded through the issuance of catastrophe bonds by Citrus Re, since 2014 and we will continue to evaluate cost-efficient alternatives to traditional reinsurance. Each year we evaluate whether to meet a portion of our reinsurance needs through the use of our reinsurance subsidiary, Osprey, which helps to manage our reinsurance expense and reduces our reliance on third-party reinsurance. Osprey Re did not absorb any losses from Hurricane Irma because we used third party reinsurers to cover catastrophe losses beyond the insurance companies’ retentions for the 2017 hurricane season. During 2018, Osprey Re absorbed approximately $20 million of combined losses  from non-cat weather related events, Hurricane Florence, and Hurricane Michael.
Efficiently Manage Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 We are committed to proactively managing our loss costs through prudent underwriting, performing critical aspects of claims adjusting through our employees, and the use of internal claims adjustment and repair services. In March 2014, we acquired the largest vendor in the CAN network, which we believe has allowed us to expand our in-house mitigation and restoration services. Additionally, the 2015 acquisition of assets of BRC provides us with additional resources and capabilities to perform restoration services in-house, as well as provide construction resources after a catastrophic event. To date, CAN and BRC have been extensively deployed in Florida only. We expanded the CAN network to North Carolina, Hawaii, and New York during 2018. We have additional contracted resources to adjust claims and mitigate losses in all states in which we conduct business and have deployed those additional resources as needed after catastrophic events. We believe the multitude of internal and external resources allowed us to deliver timely service to our policyholders and better manage claims costs.
Develop IT Solutions to More Effectively Service our Customers
 In addition to our proactive efforts to managing loss costs, we will continue to be proactive with respect to use of technology to better serve our agents and policyholders, streamline our processes, manage system implementation costs, and focus on efficiency.
Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that our growth to date and our ability to capitalize on our future growth prospects are a result of the following competitive strengths of our business:
Experienced Management Team With a Long History in the Residential Property Insurance Market 
 We have an experienced executive management team led by Bruce Lucas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Widdicombe, President, Kirk Lusk, Chief Financial Officer and Ernesto Garateix, Chief Operating Officer. Our senior management team includes twelve insurance professionals, with an average of 25 years of insurance industry experience, extensive experience in the personal and commercial residential insurance market, longstanding relationships with key participants in the insurance industry and is supported by a group of highly qualified individuals with industry expertise, including an actuarial staff with significant property insurance experience.
Strong, Conservative Capital Structure
 As of December 31, 2018, we had stockholders’ equity of $425.3 million. As of December 31, 2018, Heritage P&C, Zephyr, PIC and NBIC had policyholder surplus, as defined by statutory accounting principles, of $173.8 million, $84.3 million, $4.1 million and $113.0 million, respectively. The surplus for each of our insurance subsidiaries is in excess of the minimum capital levels required by our insurance regulators and Demotech for similarly rated insurance companies. 
Selective Underwriting and Policy Acquisition Criteria
 We believe our proprietary data analytics capabilities and underwriting processes allowed us to make better selections of the insurance policies we assumed from the Citizens depopulation program, leading to profitability and high levels of retention of business. These analytics and underwriting processes also contribute to successful underwriting of our voluntary personal and commercial lines business. Our data analytics are embedded in the underwriting process and are used for strategic expansion into new product lines and states. 
 4
 
Unique Claims Servicing Model and Superior Customer Service
 We believe that the vertical integration of our claims adjustment, water mitigation, and repair services provides us with a competitive advantage. Through our management of both claims adjusting and repair services, we are generally able to begin the adjustment and mitigation process timely which serves to better manage loss costs. We also believe our unique model provides a superior level of customer service for our policyholders, enhancing our reputation and increasing the likelihood that our policyholders will renew their policies with us. We anticipate expansion of this model in other states will improve customer service levels and operating results.
Relationships with Highly Rated Reinsurers
 We manage our exposure to catastrophic events through, among other things, the purchase of reinsurance. Our relationships with highly rated reinsurers have been developed as a result of our management team’s industry experience, and our reputation for selective underwriting and effective claims management. Our financial strength, underwriting results and the long-term relationships between our management team and our reinsurance partners help improve the cost-effectiveness of our reinsurance program.
Relationships with Independent Agents and National Underwriters
 We have developed relationships with a substantial network of independent insurance agents. We have partnerships with certain large retail agencies which amplify our production. We believe we have been able to build this network due to our reputation for financial stability, commitment to our markets and integrity in the underwriting and claims process. We have entered strategic relationships with national insurers and agencies that no longer write substantial personal residential insurance in some of the states in which we do business, which provides us access to their network of agents.
Our Competition
 The market for residential property insurance is highly competitive in most of the states in which we do business. We compete to varying degrees with insurers including large national carriers, state-sponsored homeowners’ insurance entities, and single state or regional carriers. We believe Heritage differentiates itself from many competitors with our service levels, financial resources, streamlined processes, and vertical integration which provides loss mitigation and repair services.
Products, Distribution, and Catastrophe Loss Management
 Our growth strategy centers on expansion of product offerings in our existing markets and expansion to new coastal areas of the United States which could include opportunistic acquisitions.
 Heritage P&C writes voluntary personal and commercial insurance policies through a network of independent agents in each of the states in which it is licensed. We have more than 2,300 actively writing independent agents in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Approximately 35% of our new voluntary premium is written by agents that are affiliated with eight large agency networks with which we have entered into master agency agreements.
 Zephyr writes voluntary personal and commercial insurance policies through a network of approximately 70 independent agents in Hawaii. Approximately 52% of our voluntary premium is written by agents that are affiliated with three large agency networks with which we have entered into master agency agreements. 
 NBIC writes voluntary personal lines policies through a network of retail independent agents, wholesale agents and a partnership with a large direct agency. We maintain master agency agreements with approximately 175 retail independent agents, representing over 500 agency locations, including several large agency networks. We also distribute indirectly to over 1,500 retail locations through 8 wholesale agency relationships. Our three largest relationships represent approximately $150.0 million, or 44% annualized premiums.
 We historically  wrote commercial residential policies only in the state of Florida. We market and write commercial residential policies through a network of approximately 400 independent agents in Florida. We intend to pursue additional voluntary business from these agents in our existing independent agent network, expand our independent agent network and seek additional opportunities to increase our commercial residential policies in Florida.  Additionally, we have expanded our commercial residential product to New Jersey and we intend to expand to other strategically targeted states. At December 31, 2018, we had 2,973 commercial residential policies with in force premium of $82.7 million.

In order to limit our potential exposure to individual risks and catastrophic events, we purchase significant reinsurance from third party reinsurers. Purchasing reinsurance is an important part of our risk strategy, and premiums paid (or ceded) to reinsurers is one of our largest costs. We have strong relationships with reinsurers which we believe are a result of our management’s industry experience and reputation for selective underwriting and effective claim management. For each of the twelve months beginning June 1, 2017 and 2018, we purchased catastrophe reinsurance from the following sources: (i) the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, a state-mandated catastrophe fund (“FHCF”) for Florida policies only, (ii) private reinsurers, all of which were rated “A-” or higher by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”) or Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”) or were fully collateralized, (iii) sponsorship of multiple catastrophe bonds that provide principal limit, which does not include reinstatements, that can be drawn upon over a three year period, and (iv) our wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiary, Osprey. In addition to purchasing catastrophe reinsurance, we also purchased quota share and property per risk and facultative reinsurance. Our net quota share program limits our exposure on non-catastrophe losses and provides ceding commission income. Our gross quota share program limits our exposure on both non-catastrophe and catastrophe losses and provides ceding commission income.  Our per risk program limits our net exposure in the event of a severe non-catastrophe loss impacting a single location or risk. We also utilize facultative reinsurance to supplement our per risk reinsurance program where our capacity needs dictate. See “-Reinsurance – 2018 – 2019 Reinsurance Program” of this report for additional information.
 Our insurance regulators and ratings agency require all insurance companies, like us, to have a certain amount of capital reserves and reinsurance coverage to cover losses upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. Our reinsurance programs provide reinsurance in excess of regulatory requirements, which are based on the probable maximum loss that we would incur from an individual catastrophic event estimated to occur once every 100 years based on our portfolio of insured risks. We also purchase reinsurance coverage to protect against the potential for multiple catastrophic events occurring in the same year.
 We closely manage all aspects of our claim’s adjustment process. Claims are initially reviewed by our managers and staff adjusters, who determine the extent of the loss and the resources needed to adjust each claim. In the case of a catastrophic event, we have contracted with multiple large national claims adjusting firms to assist our adjusters with the increased volume of claims and ensure timely responses to our policyholders. In March 2014, we completed the acquisition of the assets and personnel of our main water mitigation services vendor and created our wholly-owned subsidiary, CAN. This acquisition has allowed us to better service our Florida based customers and expand our mitigation and restoration services. CAN primarily handles water damage-related claims, which comprised a significant component of our non-catastrophe Florida losses and loss adjustment expenses through December 31, 2018. We also leverage our 2015 acquisition, BRC, to manage and provide restoration services to CAN customers for all types of claims. We deployed our extensive resources at CAN and BRC to perform emergency claim services and repairs in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma, Florence and Michael. Our CAN network was expanded to Hawaii, North Carolina, and New York in 2018 and we expect to continue the expansion to other states. We believe our approach to claims handling results in a higher level of customer service and reduces our losses and loss adjustment expense.
 Seasonality of our Business
 Our insurance business is seasonal; hurricanes typically occur during the period from June 1 through November 30 and winter storms generally impact the first and fourth quarters each year. With our catastrophe reinsurance program effective on June 1 each year, any variation in the cost of our reinsurance, whether due to changes to reinsurance rates or changes in the total insured value of our policy base will occur and be reflected in our financial results beginning June 1 of each year, subject to certain adjustments.

Our Market
 All of our premium in force is generated from properties located in coastal states. The following charts depicts the distribution by percentages of our in-force premium as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Underwriting
 Our underwriters evaluate and accept only those risks that they believe will enable us to achieve an underwriting profit. To achieve underwriting profitability on a consistent basis, we focus on (1) the suitability of the risk to be assumed or written, (2) the adequacy of the premium with regard to the risk to be assumed or written and (3) the geographic distribution of existing policies for our business.
 All of our underwriting is performed internally with our experienced staff. The underwriting team includes an actuarial staff, underwriters, and product development personnel. Our underwriting team uses our proprietary data analytics, which include a number of automated processes, to analyze a number of risk evaluation factors, including the age, construction, location and value of the residence as well as premiums to be received from insuring the residence. New technological advances in computer generated geographical mapping afford us an enhanced perspective as to geographic concentrations of policyholders. When considering the geographic distribution of existing policies, our underwriters may consider the number of other properties we insure within the same region, county, city and zip code. We also consider the cost of reinsurance when assessing the adequacy of the premium with regard to the risk to be assumed or written. The underwriting criteria that we consider will continue to evolve as our business grows and expands.
 We also review our expiring policies to determine whether those risks continue to meet our underwriting guidelines. If a given policy no longer meets our underwriting guidelines, we will take appropriate action regarding that policy, including raising premium rates or, to the extent permitted by applicable law not offering to renew the policy.
 Policy Administration
 We have engaged providers of web-based software solutions and insurance personnel, to provide us with policy administration services for our business, including processing, billing and policy maintenance. The software is able to adapt to a variety of forms and rates, handle the administration of an increasing number of policies as our Company grows and expands, and provide detailed information about our book of business to our internal underwriters so that they can adjust our underwriting criteria as necessary. The software provides us with daily updates regarding the insurance policies that we have issued. The systems also allow us to provide renewal notices, late payment notices, cancellation notices, endorsements and policies to our policyholders in a timely fashion.
Claims Administration
 We closely manage all aspects of the claims process, from processing the initial filing to providing remediation services for claims through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CAN, or preferred vendors. When a policyholder contacts us to report a claim, members of our claims department create a claim file and aggregate the appropriate supporting documentation. Claims are then reviewed by our managers and staff adjusters, who assess the extent of the loss, including through on-site investigations, and determine the resources needed to adjust each claim. Our claims are generally adjusted by our staff claims professionals, except in the case of a catastrophic event for which we have contracted with several large national claims adjusting firms and experienced independent contractors to assist our adjusters with the increased volume of claims and ensure timely responses to our policyholders. We currently leverage our CAN vendor network to provide repair and remediation services to our policyholders.
 7
 
We perform or supervise the services rendered to our policyholders at all stages of the claims process, which we believe allows us to reduce cost and provide a high level of customer service to our policyholders. We have in-house resources as well as outsourced vendor relationships for water mitigation and rebuilding after a loss. We engage our affiliates CAN and BRC as well as preferred service providers. To encourage our Florida policyholders to allow us to manage their claims from beginning to end, we developed our Platinum Program. Under the Platinum Program, participating customers receive a 10% discount on their claim deductible, and we obtain control over inspection, claims adjusting and repair services. 
 Liability For Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
 Our liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our preliminary estimated liability of (i) claims that have been incurred, but not yet paid (case reserves), (ii) claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us (“IBNR”), and (iii) loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) which are intended to cover the ultimate cost of settling claims, including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims. 
 Considerable time can pass between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss and the payment of that loss. Our liability for losses and LAE, which we believe represents the best estimate at a given point in time based on facts, circumstances and historical trends then known, may necessarily be adjusted to reflect additional facts that become available during the loss settlement period. We continually review and adjust our estimated losses as necessary based on industry development trends, evolving claims experience and new information obtained.
 For a discussion and summary of the activity in the liability for losses and LAE for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see Note 11 — “Reserve for Unpaid Losses” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Technology
 Our business depends upon the use, development and implementation of integrated technology systems. These systems enable us to provide a high level of service to agents and policyholders by processing business efficiently, communicating and sharing data with agents, providing a variety of methods for the payment of premiums and allowing for the accumulation and analysis of information for our management. We believe the availability and use of these technology systems has resulted in improved service to agents and customers, increased efficiencies in processing our multi-state insurance business and lower operating costs.
 We license policy and claims administration and catastrophe modeling software from third parties. We also own, or license other technology systems used by our insurance company affiliates. These technology systems consist primarily of an integrated central processing computer, a series of server-based computer networks, a back-up server and various Internet-based communications systems.
 Reinsurance 
 2018 – 2019 Reinsurance Program 
 In order to limit our potential exposure to catastrophic events, we purchase significant reinsurance from third party reinsurers and sponsor catastrophe bonds issued by Citrus Re. The catastrophe reinsurance may be on an excess of loss or quota share basis. We also purchase reinsurance for non-catastrophe losses on a quota share, per risk or facultative basis. Purchasing a sufficient amount of reinsurance to consider catastrophic losses from single or multiple events or significant non-catastrophe losses is an important part of our risk strategy, and premiums paid (or ceded) to reinsurers is one of our largest cost components. Reinsurance involves transferring, or “ceding”, a portion of the risk exposure on policies we write to another insurer, known as a reinsurer. To the extent that our reinsurers are unable to meet the obligations they assume under our reinsurance agreements, we remain liable for the entire insured loss.
 Our reinsurance agreements are prospective contracts. We record an asset, prepaid reinsurance premiums, and a liability, reinsurance payable, for the entire contract amount upon commencement of our new reinsurance agreements. We generally amortize our catastrophe reinsurance premiums over the 12-month contract period on a straight-line basis, which is June 1 through May 31. Our quota share reinsurance is amortized over the 12-month contract period and may be purchased on a calendar or fiscal year basis.
 In the event that we incur losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable under our reinsurance program, we record amounts recoverable from our reinsurers on paid losses plus an estimate of amounts recoverable on unpaid losses. The estimate of amounts recoverable on unpaid losses is a function of our liability for unpaid losses associated with the reinsured policies; therefore, the amount changes in conjunction with any changes to our estimate of unpaid losses. As a result, a reasonable possibility exists that an estimated recovery may change significantly in the near term from the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements.
 8
 
Our insurance regulators require all insurance companies, like us, to have a certain amount of capital and reinsurance coverage in order to cover losses and loss adjustment expenses upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. Our 2018-2019 reinsurance program provides reinsurance in excess of our state regulator requirements, which are based on the probable maximum loss that we would incur from an individual catastrophic event estimated to occur once in every 100 years based on our portfolio of insured risks. The nature, severity and location of the event giving rise to such a probable maximum loss differs for each insurer depending on the insurer’s portfolio of insured risks, including, among other things, the geographic concentration of insured value within such portfolio. As a result, a particular catastrophic event could be a one-in-100-year loss event for one insurance company while having a greater or lesser probability of occurrence for another insurance company. We also purchase reinsurance coverage to protect against the potential for multiple catastrophic events occurring in the same year. We share portions of our reinsurance program coverage among our insurance company affiliates.
 Catastrophe Excess of Loss Reinsurance
 Effective June 1, 2018, we entered into catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreements covering Heritage P&C, Zephyr and NBIC. The catastrophe reinsurance programs are allocated amongst traditional reinsurers, catastrophe bonds issued by Citrus Re Ltd., a Bermuda special purpose insurer formed in 2014 (“Citrus Re”) and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”). The FHCF covers Florida risks only and we participate at 45%. Citrus Re, which provides fully collateralized multi-year coverage, covers catastrophe losses incurred by Heritage P&C only through the 2016 Class D and 2017-1 Notes, and covers catastrophe losses incurred by Heritage P&C, Zephyr and NBIC through the 2016 Class E Note. Our third-party reinsurers are either rated “A- “or higher by A.M. Best or S&P or are fully collateralized, to reduce credit risk.
 The reinsurance program, which is segmented into layers of coverage, protects the Company for excess property catastrophe losses and loss adjustment expenses. The 2018-2019 reinsurance program provides first event coverage up to $1.6 billion for Heritage P&C, first event coverage up to $801 million for Zephyr, and first event coverage up to $1.0 billion for NBIC. Our first event retention for each insurance company subsidiary follows: Heritage P&C - $20.0 million; Zephyr - $20.0 million; NBIC – $12.8 million. Our second and third event retentions for each insurance company subsidiary follows: Heritage P&C - $16.0 million; Zephyr - $16 million; NBIC – $8.8 million. 
 Our program was placed on a cascading basis which provides greater horizontal protection in a multiple small events scenario and features additional coverage enhancements. This coverage exceeds the requirements established by the Companies’ rating agency, Demotech, Inc., the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, the Hawaii Insurance Division, and the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation.  For the twelve months ending May 31, 2019, no single uncollateralized private reinsurer represented more than 10% of the overall limit purchased from our total reinsurance coverage. 
 We are responsible for all losses and loss adjustment expenses in excess of our reinsurance program. For second or subsequent catastrophic events, our total available coverage depends on the magnitude of the first event, as we may have coverage remaining from layers that were not previously fully exhausted. An aggregate of $3.4 billion of limit purchased in 2018 includes reinstatement through the purchase of reinsurance reinstatement premium. In total, we have purchased $3.5 billion of potential reinsurance coverage, including our retention, for multiple catastrophic events. Our ability to access this coverage, however, will be subject to the severity and frequency of such events.
 The Company's estimated net cost for the 2018-2019 catastrophe reinsurance programs is approximately $252.0 million.
 Gross Quota Share Reinsurance
 NBIC purchased an 8% gross quota share reinsurance treaty effective June 1, 2018 which provides ground up loss recoveries of up to $1.0 billion.  Prior to this treaty, NBIC’s gross quota share treaty was 18.75%.
 9
 
Net Quota Share Reinsurance
 NBIC’s Net Quota Share coverage is proportional reinsurance for which certain of our other reinsurance inures to the quota share (property catastrophe excess of loss and reinstatement premium protection and the second layer of the general excess of loss.) An occurrence limit of $20.0 million for catastrophe losses is in effect on the quota share, subject to certain aggregate loss limits that vary by reinsurer. The amount and rate of reinsurance commissions slide, within a prescribed minimum and maximum, depending on loss performance. NBIC ceded 49.5% of net premiums and losses during 2018 to the Net Quota Share and 8% of the 2017 Net Quota Share was runoff. The Net Quota Share program was renewed on December 31, 2018 ceding 52.0% of the net premiums and losses and 10% of the prior year quota share will runoff.
Aggregate Coverage Heritage P&C and Zephyr
 $1.1 billion of limit is structured on an aggregate basis (Top and Aggregate, Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, Layer 4, Stub layers, Multi-Zonal, 2017-1 Notes and 2016 Class E Notes). To the extent that this coverage is not fully exhausted in the first catastrophic event, it provides coverage commencing at its reduced retention for second and subsequent events where underlying coverage has been previously exhausted. The Company paid a reinsurance reinstatement premium for $669.0 million of this coverage, which can be reinstated one time. Layers (with exception to FHCF and 2016 Class D Notes) are “net” of a $40.0 million attachment point. Layers inure to the subsequent layers if the aggregate limit of the preceding layer(s) is exhausted, and the subsequent layer cascades down in its place.
 NBIC placed 42.50% of an aggregate contract, which covers all catastrophe losses excluding named storms, on May 31, 2018, expiring December 31, 2018. The limit on the contract is $20.0 million, retention of $3.0 million and franchise deductible of $1.5 million.
 NBIC placed 92.00% of an occurrence contract, which covers all catastrophe losses excluding named storms, on May 31, 2018, expiring December 31, 2018. The limit on the contract is $20.0 million with a retention of $20.0 million.
 NBIC placed 40.00% of an aggregate contract, which covers all catastrophe losses excluding named storms, on December 31, 2018, expiring May 31, 2019. The limit on the contract is $20.0 million, retention of $20.0 million and franchise deductible of $1.0 million.
 NBIC placed 100.00% of an occurrence contract, which covers all catastrophe losses excluding named storms, on December 31, 2018, expiring December 31, 2019. The limit on the contract is $20.0 million with a retention of $20.0 million and has 1 reinstatement available. 
 Per Risk Coverage   
 The Company also purchased property per risk coverage for losses and loss adjustment expenses in excess of $1.0 million per claim. The limit recovered for an individual loss is $9.0 million and total limit for all losses is $27.0 million. There are two reinstatements available with additional premium due based on the amount of the layer exhausted. In addition, the Company purchased facultative reinsurance in excess of $10.0 million for any commercial properties it insured where the total insured value exceeded $10.0 million. 
General Excess of Loss
 NBIC’s general excess of loss reinsurance protects NBIC from single risk losses, both property and casualty. The casualty coverage provided by this contract also responds on a “Clash” basis, meaning that multiple policies involved in a single loss occurrence can be aggregated into one loss and applied to the reinsurance contract. The coverage is in two layers in excess of NBIC’s retention of the first $300,000 of loss. The first layer is $450,000 excess $300,000 and the second layer is $2.75 million excess $750,000 (Casualty second layer is $1.25 million excess $750,000).

Investments
 Our investments are managed by three third-party asset managers. We have designed our investment policy to provide a balance between current yield, conservation of capital and the liquidity requirements of our operations. As such, our investable assets are primarily held in cash and bonds of high credit quality with relatively short durations. Our investment policy sets guidelines that provide for a well-diversified investment portfolio that is compliant with insurance regulations applicable to the states in which we operate. Our investment objectives include liquidity, safety and security of principal, and returns. The investment policy limits investments in common and preferred stocks and requires a minimum weighted average portfolio quality of A for our bond portfolio with an overall duration of 2-5 years. No more than 2% of admitted assets can be invested in any one issuer, with slightly higher limits for highly rated securities, excluding government-related securities. Investments in commercial mortgages cannot exceed 10% of admitted assets. Prohibited investments include short sales and margin purchases, oil, gas, mineral or other types of leases, speculative uses of futures and options, unrated corporate securities, non-US denominated securities, convertible securities high risk CMO instruments, repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions and speculative foreign currency valuation transactions. Our investment policy, which may change from time to time, is approved by our Investment Committee and is reviewed on a regular basis in order to ensure that our investment policy evolves in response to changes in the financial markets. See Note 3 “Investments” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 As of December 31, 2018, we held $250.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $526.1 million in securities, which were comprised of $509.6 million in fixed maturities, $12.8 million in nonredeemable preferred stocks and $3.7 million in common stock. From the $509.6 million of fixed maturities, $31.0 million of U.S. government agency securities were pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) in connection with a FHLB loan to Heritage P&C. See Note 12. Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Government Regulation
 The insurance industry is extensively regulated. Our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulations of the states in which they do business. The insurance regulatory statutes and rules provide for regulation of virtually all aspects of the business of insurance companies. The states in which we conduct business, like many states, have adopted several model laws and regulations as promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). State statutes and administrative rules generally require each insurance company that is part of a holding company group to register with the department of insurance in its state of domicile and to furnish information concerning the operations of the companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the group. As part of its registration, each insurance company must identify material agreements, relationships and transactions with affiliates, including without limitation loans, investments, asset transfers, transactions outside of the ordinary course of business, certain management, service, and cost sharing agreements, reinsurance transactions, dividends and consolidated tax allocation agreements. In some instances, individual state insurance laws and regulations are even more stringent that those promulgated by the NAIC or other states.
 We are subject to regulations administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business. These regulations relate to, among other things:
  
• | the content and timing of required notices and other policyholder information;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the amount of premiums the insurer may assume or write in relation to its surplus (writing ratios);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the amount and nature of reinsurance a company is required to purchase;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | participation in guaranty funds and other statutorily created markets or organizations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | business operations and claims practices;
--+------------------------------------------


• | approval of policy forms and premium rates;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | licensing of insurers and their products;
--+------------------------------------------


• | restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restrictions on the ability of insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends to insurance holding companies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restrictions on transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders;
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 14
 
 
• | requiring certain methods of accounting;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | periodic examinations of our operations and finances;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring reserves.
--+--------------------

 The State of Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (“FLOIR”) imposed certain additional solvency related requirements as a condition of receiving a certificate of authority for our Florida insurance company subsidiary. Finally, our insurance company affiliates are subject to state regulations or consent orders setting conditions related to various transactions, including intercompany transactions. We are in full compliance with all consent orders.
 State regulators where we are and may become licensed and offer insurance products conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory authorities also conduct periodic examinations into insurers’ business practices. Additionally, we are subject to assessments levied by governmental and quasi-governmental entities from the states in which we conduct business. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 447 employees, 438 of whom are full-time. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and have not experienced any work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes. We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
