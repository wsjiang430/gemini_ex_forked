ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
We invest in intellectual property, or IP, and related absolute return assets and engage in the licensing and enforcement of patented technologies. We partner with inventors and patent owners, from small entities to large corporations, applying our legal and technology expertise to patent assets to unlock the financial value in their patented inventions. We are an intermediary in the patent marketplace, bridging the gap between invention and application, and facilitating efficiency in connection with the monetization of patent assets.
We generate revenues and related cash flows from the granting of IP rights for the use of patented technologies that our operating subsidiaries control or own. We assist patent owners with the prosecution and development of their patent portfolios, the protection of their patented inventions from unauthorized use, the generation of licensing revenue from users of their patented technologies and, where necessary, with the enforcement against unauthorized users of their patented technologies through the filing of patent infringement litigation. Currently, on a consolidated basis, our operating subsidiaries own or control the rights to multiple patent portfolios, which include U.S. patents and certain foreign counterparts, covering technologies used in a variety of industries. 
We have established a proven track record of licensing and enforcement success with over 1,560 license agreements executed to date, across nearly 200 patent portfolio licensing and enforcement programs. To date, we have generated gross licensing revenue of approximately $1.6 billion, and have returned more than $767 million to our patent partners.

Patent Licensing and Enforcement Business
Patents are an important asset class worldwide. Licensing and enforcing patents requires an experienced, well-capitalized, licensing partner. We have partnered with patent owners, including individual inventors, universities, small companies and large multi-national corporations in a variety of technology sectors. These patent owners may possess limited internal resources and/or expertise to effectively address the unauthorized use of their patented technologies, or may seek to effectively and efficiently monetize their portfolio of patented technologies on an outsourced basis. 
Under U.S. law, a patent owner has the right to exclude others from making, selling or using their patented invention. A third-party infringes a patent by making, offering for sale, selling, or using a patented invention without a license from the patent owner. In the majority of cases, infringers are generally unwilling, at least initially, to negotiate or pay reasonable license fees for their unauthorized use of third-party patents and will typically indiscriminately challenge any allegations of patent infringement. Inventors and patent holders without sufficient legal, financial and expert technical resources to bring and continue the pursuit of costly and complex patent infringement actions are often effectively ignored.
As a result of the common reluctance of patent infringers to negotiate and ultimately enter into a patent license for the use of patented technologies without at least the threat of legal action, patent licensing and enforcement often begins with the filing of patent infringement litigation. However, in our experience, most patent infringement litigation settles out of court at amounts that are related to the strength of the patent portfolio and the value of the invention or inventions in the infringer’s products or services. We execute agreements that grant rights in our patents to users of our patented technologies. Our agreements can be negotiated without the filing of patent litigation, or negotiated within the context of ongoing patent litigation, depending on the specific facts and circumstances. 
We are a principal in the licensing and enforcement effort, with our operating subsidiaries obtaining control of the rights in the patent portfolio, or control of the patent portfolio outright. Our relationship with patent owners drives our corporate strategy. We assume all responsibility for advancing operational expenses while pursuing a patent licensing and enforcement program, and then, when applicable, share net licensing revenue with our patent partners as that program matures, on a pre-arranged and negotiated basis. We may also provide upfront capital to patent owners as an advance against future licensing revenue.  
Patent Licensing Business Model and Strategy - Overview
We have the flexibility to structure arrangements in a number of ways to address the needs and specific sets of circumstances presented by each of our unique patent partners, ranging from outright purchases to various forms of partnering arrangements. 
Generally, we maintain a 100% to 200% preferred rate of return until all deployed capital and advanced operational costs are recovered by us. After recovery of these costs, the net profit revenue share with patent partner commences, if applicable.
Key Elements of Business Strategy
Patent licensing and enforcement can be an effective and efficient way to maximize the profit potential of a patent, or patents, that are being practiced by third-parties without authorization. A patent license agreement grants a third-party user of an invention specific patent rights to the patented invention in exchange for patent license fees. Our patent licensing business provides patent holders with an opportunity to generate income from their patented inventions being practiced by third-parties without authorization and from third-parties that desire to practice their patented inventions with authorization. Our patent licensing and enforcement business strategy includes three fundamental elements, as follows:

• | Patent Discovery - Discover potentially valuable patents or patent portfolios.


• | Assessment of Economic Value - Work internally and with external experts to evaluate the use of the patented invention(s) in the relevant marketplace and assess a patent or patent portfolio's expected economic value.


• | Licensing and Enforcement - License those users wanting to utilize the patented invention with authorization. For unauthorized users of the patented invention, enter into license negotiations and, if necessary, litigation to monetize the patent based on its assessed value.

Patent Discovery. The patent process breeds, encourages and sustains innovation and invention by granting a limited monopoly to the inventor in exchange for sharing the invention with the public. Certain technologies become core technologies in the way products and services are manufactured, sold or delivered by companies across a wide array of industries. Patent discovery involves identifying core, patented technologies that have been or are anticipated to be widely adopted by third-parties in connection with the manufacture, sale or use of products and services. 
Assessment of Economic Value. Subsequent to the patent discovery process, our executives work internally and/or with external industry experts in the specific technology field, to evaluate the patented invention and its adoption and implementation in the marketplace. There are a number of factors to consider when analyzing a patent and determining a patent’s value including, (i) infringement, (ii) validity, (iii) enforceability and (iv) extent of usage.
To determine infringement, we must first identify third-parties that are practicing the invention(s) covered by the patent without obtaining permission from the patent owner to do so. A key tool in determining whether or not a company is infringing a patent is a claim chart, which demonstrates how the manufacture, sale, or use of an existing product compares against the claims of the patent. 
The three main factors analyzed to determine validity are: (1) anticipation, which occurs when the claims of the patent are entirely revealed within a single piece of prior art, (2) obviousness which considers whether the differences between prior art and the patented invention are so slight that they would have been obvious at the time of invention to one who is skilled in the subject matter being patented, and (3) the existence of non-patentable subject matter, which considers whether the subject matter includes naturally occurring things, abstract concepts, or algorithms that perform an ordinary function.
To determine enforceability, a number of factors are analyzed, including whether or not there has been patent misuse, or whether or not there are antitrust violations associated with the patent. Due to the inherently complex nature of patent law, only a court or specific administrative body, such as the International Trade Commission, can make a decision whether a patent is infringed, valid and enforceable; however, we employ our wealth of expertise to make the best assessment possible given a specific fact pattern and set of circumstances. 
We estimate a patent’s economic value by evaluating the expected value of the license revenue stream based on past, present and future revenue of infringing products or services, and the risk that a court will disagree with our infringement, validity or enforcement assessments of the patent. The processes and procedures employed in connection with the evaluation of a specific patent portfolio for future investment, licensing and enforcement are tailored and unique to each specific situation and can vary widely based on the specific facts and circumstances of a specific patent portfolio, such as the related technology, related industry and other factors. 
Our business development efforts are geared toward maintaining those relationships and identifying and growing new relationships in order to generate new technology-based patent opportunities for sustainable revenue and /or revenue growth.

Legislative and legal changes have increased the complexity of patent enforcement actions. We believe that this provides Acacia a competitive advantage, as many patent monetization entities have either given up or failed. Furthermore, the challenging legislative environment has kept patent asset acquisition prices low.
In fiscal year 2018, Acacia experienced a number of changes in the Company's outlook and leadership. With new management in place during the year, the focus was on capturing the value of remaining portfolio assets while starting to rebuild the new business pipeline. In addition, we began to pursue other business opportunities which complement our legacy licensing and enforcement business and leverage our IP expertise, as described below.
Licensing and Enforcement. The final step in the patent licensing and enforcement process is to seek to monetize the patent portfolio by securing license agreements based on the patents use in the marketplace and estimated value. While we prefer to convince unauthorized users of our patented inventions of the value of the patented invention and secure a license

agreement in a non-litigious manner, many infringers refuse to take such licenses even when confronted with substantial and persuasive evidence of infringement, validity, enforceability and significant economic value. As a result, often we must resort to litigation to demonstrate and prove infringement and ultimately induce infringers to take a license from us. We often negotiate licenses concurrently with litigation due to the fact that litigation necessitates and facilitates an information exchange that helps both sides assess the value of a patent and make informed decisions. Also, litigation eventually leads to a court’s judgment. When a court agrees with our assessment of a patent, this judgment stops recalcitrant infringers from utilizing the patented technology indefinitely, without appropriate authorization. 
We engage highly competent and experienced patent lawyers to prosecute our patent portfolio litigation. It is imperative for us to be persistent and patient throughout the litigation process as it typically takes 18-36 months from the filing date of a lawsuit to yield a license agreement from a potential licensee. Often, it takes longer to secure a final court judgment. 
Patent license negotiations and litigation initiated by our operating subsidiaries usually lead to serious and thoughtful discussions with the unauthorized users of the patented inventions. The result can be quite favorable with the user being granted rights under the patents for the patented invention in its products and services in exchange for financial remuneration. 
Investments
In August 2016, we entered into an investment agreement with Veritone, a cloud-based Artificial Intelligence technology company. In connection with this investment agreement, we provided a total of $53.3 million in funding. Upon Veritone’s consummation of its initial public offering on May 17, 2017, or IPO, our loans and accrued interest were automatically converted into shares of Veritone common stock, and we were issued an additional warrant to purchase additional shares of Veritone common stock as described elsewhere herein. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's investment in Veritone totaled $7.5 million. 
In June 2017, we made a $2.25 million equity investment in Miso Robotics, Inc., or Miso Robotics, an innovative leader in robotics and Artificial Intelligence, or AI, solutions. The investment was part of Miso Robotics’ closing of $3.1 million in Series A funding. In addition, in February 2018, we made an additional equity investment totaling $6.0 million in the Series B financing round for Miso Robotics, increasing our fully diluted ownership interest to approximately 30%. Miso Robotics will use the capital to expand its suite of collaborative, adaptable robotic kitchen assistants and to broaden applications for Miso AI, the company’s machine learning cloud platform.
Patented Technologies
Currently, on a consolidated basis, our operating subsidiaries own or control the rights to patent portfolios with future patent expiration dates ranging from 2019 to approximately 2033, covering technologies used in a number of industries, including: transportation and automotive, telecommunications, semiconductor, consumer electronics, energy efficiency, wireless, video/imaging and medical devices.
Refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview” for a summary of patent portfolios generating revenues for the applicable periods presented.
Competition
We encounter competition in the area of patent portfolio investment opportunities and enforcement. Existing non-practicing entities compete in acquiring rights to IP assets, and more entities may enter or leave the market in future periods.
We also compete with financial firms, corporate buyers and others acquiring IP and investing in other technology opportunities. Many of these competitors may have more financial and human resources than us. We may find more companies entering the market for similar technology opportunities, which may reduce our market share in one or more technology industries that we currently or in the future may rely upon to generate future revenue.

Companies or other entities may develop competing technologies that offer better or less expensive alternatives to our patented technologies or technology partnerships. Many potential competitors may have significantly greater resources than the resources that we or our operating subsidiaries possess. Such technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors could render certain of the technologies owned or controlled by us obsolete and/or uneconomical.
