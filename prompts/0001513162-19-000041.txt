Item 1.  Business
Overview
 Vaxart Biosciences, Inc. was originally incorporated in California in March 2004, under the name West Coast Biologicals, Inc. and changed its name to Vaxart, Inc., or Private Vaxart, in July 2007, and reincorporated in the state of Delaware.
 On February 13, 2018, Private Vaxart completed a reverse merger, or the Merger, with Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc., or Aviragen, pursuant to which Private Vaxart survived as a wholly owned subsidiary of Aviragen. Under the terms of the Merger, Aviragen changed its name to Vaxart, Inc. and Private Vaxart changed its name to Vaxart Biosciences, Inc.  Unless otherwise indicated, all references to Vaxart, we, us, our or the Company in this Annual Report on Form 10-K mean Vaxart, Inc., the combined company.
 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of oral recombinant vaccines based on our proprietary oral vaccine platform. Our oral vaccines are designed to generate broad and durable immune responses that protect against a wide range of infectious diseases and may be useful for the treatment of chronic viral infections and cancer. Our vaccines are administered using a convenient room temperature-stable tablet, rather than by injection. 
 
We are developing prophylactic vaccine candidates that target a range of infectious diseases. These include norovirus, a widespread cause of acute gastro-intestinal enteritis, for which two Phase 1 human studies have been completed; seasonal influenza, for which our vaccine protected patients in a recent Phase 2 challenge study; and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, a common cause of respiratory tract infections. In addition, we are developing our first therapeutic immune-oncology vaccine targeting cervical cancer and dysplasia caused by human papillomavirus, or HPV. 
 
Vaccines have been essential in eradicating or significantly reducing multiple devastating infectious diseases, including polio, smallpox, mumps, measles, diphtheria, hepatitis B, influenza, human papillomavirus and several others. According to a recent MarketsandMarkets research report Vaccines Market - Global Forecast to 2023, the global market for vaccines is expected to reach $50.42 billion by 2023 from $36.45 billion in 2018, at a compound annual growth rate of 6.7%.
 
We believe our oral tablet vaccine candidates offer several important advantages:
 
First, they are designed to generate broad and durable immune responses, including systemic, mucosal and T cell responses, which may enhance protection against certain infectious diseases, such as influenza, norovirus and RSV, and may have potential clinical benefit for certain cancers and chronic viral infections, such as those caused by HPV. 
 
Second, our tablet vaccine candidates are designed to provide a more efficient and convenient method of administration, enhance patient acceptance and reduce distribution bottlenecks, which we believe will improve the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. For example, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, in the 2017/2018 seasonal influenza season, only approximately 42% of the U.S. population was vaccinated against influenza, with particularly low vaccination rates among adults between ages 18 and 49.
 
Finally, we believe that utilizing our recombinant methods and production process will allow us to manufacture vaccines at scale more efficiently and within shorter time frames than conventional vaccines manufactured using traditional methods.
 
Our Product Pipeline
 
We are developing the following tablet vaccine candidates, which are all based on our proprietary platform:
 ·         Norovirus Vaccine. We are developing an oral tablet vaccine for norovirus, a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in the United States and Europe. Because norovirus infects the small intestine, we believe that our vaccine, which is designed to produce mucosal antibodies locally in the intestine in addition to systemic antibodies in the blood, will better protect against norovirus infection than an injectable vaccine. Clinical evidence that vaccines based on our platform technology can protect against infection is described under Clinical Trial Update in the Seasonal Influenza Vaccine section below. 
 Norovirus is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea from acute gastroenteritis among people of all ages in the United States. Each year, on average, norovirus causes 19 to 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis and contributes to 56,000 to 71,000 hospitalizations and 570 to 800 deaths, mostly among young children and older adults. Typical symptoms include dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea with abdominal cramps, and nausea. In a study conducted by Pittsburg School of Medicine in 2012, the total economic burden of norovirus in the United States was estimated at $5.5 billion. In a more recent study by CDC and Johns Hopkins University, the global economic impact of norovirus disease was estimated at $60 billion, $34 billion of which occurred in high income countries including the United States, Europe and Japan. Virtually all norovirus disease is caused by norovirus GI and GII genotypes, and we are developing a bivalent vaccine designed to protect against both.

Clinical Trial Update. We have completed two Phase 1 clinical trials with our monovalent oral tablet vaccine for the GI.1 norovirus strain. The vaccine was well-tolerated and generated broad systemic and mucosal immune responses. In the clinical Phase 1b dose optimization study in healthy adults in which we evaluated four different dosing regimens, all vaccine recipients (100%) in the high dose group responded as measured by a significant increase in norovirus-specific B cells of both IgA and IgG subtypes. In the same group, there was at least a two-fold increase of norovirus-specific antibody titers in serum in more than 90% of recipients.
 We are preparing for two norovirus clinical trials, a bivalent Phase 1 study designed to assess safety and immunogenicity of our norovirus GI.1 and GII.4 vaccines administered concurrently, and a monovalent Phase 2 challenge study designed to assess the protective efficacy of our norovirus GI.1 vaccine against live norovirus GI.1 challenge in humans. The Phase 1 bivalent study and the Phase 2 challenge study will both be conducted under an open IND. Clinical protocols for both studies have been submitted to the FDA. In preparation for the Phase 2 challenge study, we have conducted a virus titration study to help determine the appropriate quantity of the norovirus GI.1 virus to be used to challenge patients in the study.
 
The bivalent study is conducted using both the norovirus GI.1 and GII.4 vaccines.  The challenge study is conducted using only the norovirus GI.1 vaccine. As announced in November 2018, the norovirus GI.1 vaccine tablets that we manufactured in 2018 failed release testing, causing both studies that were scheduled to begin before the end of 2018 to be delayed. Since then, we have manufactured two new lots of bulk GI.1 vaccine that are scheduled to be processed and tableted in the coming weeks. If processing and tableting is successful and the vaccine passes all required release testing, the norovirus GI.1 vaccine tablets are expected to become available for the currently planned clinical trials during the second quarter of 2019. The norovirus GII.4 vaccine tablets we manufactured in 2018 have passed all required release testing and are available for use in our clinical trials, subject to final review of the Certificate of Analysis by the FDA. For more information on our manufacturing process, capabilities and strategy, please see the paragraph Manufacturing in this business section below.
 
·      Seasonal Influenza Vaccine. Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide and, according to the CDC, only 42% of eligible U.S. citizens were vaccinated in 2017/2018, with particularly low vaccination rates among adults between ages 18 and 49. We believe our oral tablet vaccine has the potential to improve the protective efficacy of currently available influenza vaccines and increase flu vaccination rates.
 Influenza is one of the most common global infectious diseases, causing mild to life-threatening illness and even death. It is estimated that at least 350 million cases of seasonal influenza occur annually worldwide, of which three to five million cases are considered severe, causing 290,000 to 650,000 deaths per year globally. During the most recent flu season 2017  2018, there were 79,400 flu related deaths in the U.S. alone, according to the CDC. Very young children and the elderly are at the greatest risk. In the United States, between 5% and 20% of the population contracts influenza, 226,000 people are hospitalized with complications of influenza, and between 3,000 and 49,000 people die from influenza and its complications each year, with up to 90% of the influenza-related deaths occurring in adults older than 65. The total economic burden of seasonal influenza has been estimated to be $87.1 billion, including medical costs which average $10.4 billion annually, while lost earnings due to illness and loss of life amount to $16.3 billion annually.
 We believe our tablet vaccine candidate has the potential to address many of the limitations of current injectable egg-based influenza vaccines, because: our tablet vaccine candidates are designed to create broad and durable immune responses, which may provide more effective immunity and protect against additional strain variants; our vaccine is delivered as a room temperature-stable tablet, which should provide a more convenient method of administration to enhance patient acceptance, and should simplify distribution and administration; and, by using recombinant methods, we believe our tablet vaccine may be manufactured more rapidly than vaccines manufactured using egg-based methods and should eliminate the risk of allergic reactions to egg protein.
 Clinical Trial Update. In September 2018, we completed a $15.7 million contract with the U.S. Government through the Office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, under which a Phase 2 challenge study of our H1N1 flu vaccine candidate was conducted. Previously, we had announced that, in healthy volunteers immunized and then experimentally infected with H1 influenza, our H1 influenza oral tablet vaccine reduced clinical disease by 39% relative to placebo, a result that was superior to that of Fluzone, the market-leading injectable quadrivalent influenza vaccine, which reduced clinical disease by only 27%. Our tablet vaccine also showed a favorable safety profile, indistinguishable from placebo. On October 4, 2018, we presented data from the study demonstrating that our vaccine elicited a significant expansion of mucosal homing receptor plasmablasts to approximately 60% of all activated B cells, while Fluzone only maintained baseline levels of 20%. We believe plasmablasts are a key indicator of a protective mucosal immune response and a unique feature of our vaccines. This data also provided evidence that our vaccines protect through mucosal immunity, the first line of defense against mucosal infections such as flu, norovirus, RSV and others, a potential key advantage over injectable vaccines for these indications.

At this time, we aim to finance development and commercialization of our seasonal quadrivalent influenza oral tablet vaccine through third-party collaboration and licensing arrangements, and/or non-dilutive funding. In the future, we may also consider equity offerings and/or debt financings to fund the program.
 
·      HPV Therapeutic Vaccine. Our first therapeutic oral vaccine candidate targets HPV-16 and HPV-18, the two strains responsible for 70% of cervical cancers and precancerous cervical dysplasia.
 
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and in the United States with about 13,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States according to the National Cervical Cancer Coalition.
 
We have tested our HPV-16 vaccine candidate in two different HPV-16 solid tumor models in mice. The vaccine elicited T cell responses and promoted migration of the activated T cells into the tumors, leading to tumor cell killing. Mice that received our HPV-16 vaccine showed a significant reduction in volume of their established tumors.
 
In October 2018, we filed a pre-IND meeting request for our HPV therapeutic vaccines, VXA-HPV16.1 and VXA-HPV18.1, with the FDA, and we subsequently submitted a pre-IND briefing package. We received feedback from the FDA in January 2019 providing guidance for the IND we plan to submit. Based on this feedback, we expect to be able to file an IND for this product candidate in the course of 2019. 
 
·      RSV Vaccine. RSV is a major respiratory pathogen with a significant burden of disease in the very young and in the elderly.
 
Based on the positive results of our cotton rat study, we believe our proprietary oral vaccine platform is the optimal vaccine delivery system for RSV, offering significant advantages over injectable vaccines. We aim to develop a tablet RSV vaccine by licensing one or more RSV protein antigens that have demonstrated protection against RSV infection in clinical studies, or by partnering with a third party with RSV antigens that can be delivered with our platform.
 Additional Objectives
 ·      Develop Other Tablet Vaccine Candidates Based On Our Proprietary Platform. Our technology platform employs a modular approach using the Ad5 vector-adjuvant construct with disease-specific antigens and can be used to create new tablet vaccine candidates for a wide range of infectious diseases. We may consider exploring additional infectious diseases including RSV, Chikungunya, Hepatitis B and Herpes Simplex Virus 2, or HSV-2. In addition, we intend to leverage our vaccine formulation expertise to develop oral formulations suitable for pediatric populations.
 ·      Further Strengthen Our Intellectual Property Portfolio. We intend to continue to strengthen our patent portfolio by filing and prosecuting current and future patent applications in the United States and international jurisdictions. In addition, we have established in-house formulation and tableting capabilities which we believe will allow us to further improve and optimize our proprietary techniques and know-how.
 ·      Maximize the Commercial Value of Our Tablet Vaccine Candidates. We believe that we own worldwide rights for the research, development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of our tablet vaccine candidates. As we further develop our product candidates, we may seek partners to maximize the commercial opportunity of such tablet vaccine candidates.

Anti-Virals
 ·      Through our merger with Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc., or Aviragen, we acquired two royalty earning products, Relenza and Inavir, and three Phase 2 clinical stage antiviral compounds. 
 ·      Relenza and Inavir are antivirals for the treatment of influenza that are marketed by GSK and Daiichi Sankyo, respectively. We earn royalties on the net sales of Relenza and Inavir in Japan. Sales of Relenza and Inavir vary significantly from one year to the next, depending on the intensity of the flu season and competition from other antivirals such as Tamiflu. Importantly, on February 23, 2018, Xofluza, a new drug to treat influenza developed by Shionogi, was approved in Japan. The drug may gain significant market share, substantially reducing sales of Inavir.
 ·      The three Phase 2 antiviral compounds obtained through the merger with Aviragen are: 1) BTA074, or teslexivir, an antiviral treatment for condyloma caused by human papillomavirus types 6 & 11; 2) vapendavir, a capsid inhibitor for the prevention or treatment of rhinovirus upper respiratory infections; and 3) BTA585, or enzaplatovir, a fusion protein inhibitor for the treatment of RSV infections. We have discontinued all three programs.

  Our Pipeline
 Fig. 1.  The following table outlines the status of our oral vaccine development programs and our two marketed products: 


Our Tablet Vaccine Platform
 Vaccines based on our oral adjuvant-vector platform are designed to generate broad local and systemic immune responses, which may offer important advantages in addressing a wide range of infectious diseases.
Platform Components
 Our platform technology employs a vector-based approach and consists of the following components:
 ·      A vector, which is a virus used as a carrier to deliver DNA coding for vaccine antigens and an adjuvant selected to activate the immune system of the gut. Specifically, we use non-replicating adenovirus type 5, or Ad5, which delivers the DNA for both the antigen and adjuvant to the cells of the small intestine, where both the antigen and adjuvant are co-expressed.
 ·      A protein antigen, which is a viral or bacterial protein that stimulates an immune response to the selected pathogen. We use a different antigen for each of our current clinical vaccine candidates.
 ·      An adjuvant, which is a substance that enhances the immune-stimulating properties of the vaccine. We use a Toll-like receptor 3, or TLR3, agonist, which was selected specifically for its ability to activate the immune system of the gut.
 ·      Our proprietary enteric-coated tablet which is designed to deliver the Ad5 vector to the small intestine.

 Adenovirus 5 Vector
 Ad5 is an extensively studied and well-characterized vector. Over 200 clinical trials conducted by others have used Ad5 for a wide range of applications, and we believe that using the same adenovirus in our tablet vaccine candidates will reduce regulatory risk, given that it is known to regulatory authorities.
Recombinant Antigen
 Our vector contains cloning space where DNA encoding for any recombinant antigen can be inserted. In the vaccine programs pursued to date, we have chosen recombinant antigens that are known to be key targets of the immune system with the ability to generate protection against the corresponding pathogen. The Ad5 vector-adjuvant gene cassette allows for a modular approach.
Adjuvant
 We use a short section of double-stranded RNA, or dsRNA, as an adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of our tablet vaccine candidates. dsRNA is a Toll Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist and is recognized by the innate immune system as a signal that an undesired viral replication is ongoing, triggering it to mount an immune response in defense. dsRNA is one of the few signals available for use in the intestine as the natural large reservoir of bacteria (the microbiome) makes it difficult to use bacteria- related signals. We chose this adjuvant because of its ability to complement the non-replicating adenovirus when administered orally, and because very few pathways of immune system recognition signals occur in the small intestine. Importantly, our adjuvant is expressed within a cell, not provided as a separate component, resulting in a more localized response when compared with adjuvants contained in injectable vaccines.
 Enteric-Coated Tablet
 While tablets are typically used to deliver small molecules to the intestine, we have designed our tablets to deliver the much larger adenovirus particles. We hold intellectual property related to the composition and formulation of our tablet vaccine candidates. Our tablet manufacturing does not require sterile fill and finish processing, such as for injectables, but rather uses standard tableting equipment.
 How Our Tablet Vaccine Candidates Work
 Our tablets are designed to deliver vaccines to the small intestine. The tablets are covered with a protective coating that remains intact in the low pH environment of the stomach and protects the active ingredient contained in the tablet core from the acidic environment in the stomach. The coating is designed to dissolve in the neutral pH environment of the small intestine which we are targeting to generate an optimal immune response. Once the coating has dissolved, the tablets disintegrate, and the vaccine is released into the small intestine where it can reach and enter the mucosal cells lining the intestine. Once inside the mucosal cells, the antigen protein and adjuvant are expressed, or manufactured, by the cells. The adjuvant is molecular in nature and always produced within the exact same intestinal cells that also produce the antigen. Importantly, unlike current recombinant vaccines that are manufactured in insect cells or yeast which may introduce subtle structural changes to the protein antigen, the production of antigens delivered using our approach is identical to that of the actual pathogen when it invades the mucosa. In addition, we believe that delivering the replication incompetent Ad5-vectored vaccine via tablet directly to the gut avoids neutralization by blood or muscle tissue-based immune cells, an advantage over injected vector-based vaccines.

Caption. 1. Enteric-coated tablet is administered. The tablet coating protects the active ingredient from stomach acid degradation. 2. When the tablet reaches the small intestine, it releases the active ingredient, the viral vector, that can then transfect the epithelial cells in the mucosal epithelium and deliver the genes for the two payloads (antigen and adjuvant). 3. Expression of the antigen and adjuvant in the epithelial cells then leads to the TLR3 signaling cascade that can activate B and T cells.
 Immune cells come in contact with proteins, and if the protein elicits an immune recognition signal, the immune cell becomes activated. This eventually leads to an immune response, producing either memory cells or large quantities of antibodies that bind to a key antigen. The expressed antigen and adjuvant of its platform, like other vaccines, cause induction of B and T cells specific for the antigen. Induction is believed to begin when an immature dendritic cell (specialized immune cell) absorbs an epithelial cell expressing both the antigen and adjuvant that were delivered by the Ad5 vector. Upon induction, dendritic cells migrate to the regional lymph nodes where they interact with recirculating naive B and T cells. The dendritic cell presents pieces of the antigen on its surface to stimulate T cells, and some of the antigen drains into the lymph node to stimulate B cells. Upon recognizing its specific antigen, small B or T cells stop migrating and enlarge. These then multiply in a clonal fashion and eventually recirculate to the tissues. B cells secrete antibodies that recognize the antigen and T cells find cells that have antigen presented on their surface and either kill the presenting cell or stimulate a local inflammatory response. A successful vaccination occurs if the B cells and T cells can form either memory cells (cells specialized to respond quickly to the protective antigen upon subsequent exposure) or enough antibody to a key antigen is made in large quantity to block infection.
 The Significance of Mucosal Immunity and T Cell Responses
 The immune system has developed defenses against pathogens by creating a special class of immune effectors, such as mucosal antibodies that are directed to wet surfaces and killer T cells that can kill pathogen infected cells. Most vaccines available today have been developed primarily to elicit blood circulating, or systemic B cell responses. However, there remain many infections, such as norovirus and RSV for which no vaccines exist. These and other pathogens may need greater immune responses outside of serum antibodies. Organisms that cause these infections largely evade the antibody immune response generated by serum antibodies in the blood because the pathogenic organism can pass through cells that line the open, mucosal membranes without coming into direct contact with blood. Alternatively, the serum antibodies are unable to penetrate into the cells infected by the pathogen.
 Injectable vaccines available today typically do not induce mucosal immune responses, and subunit vaccines do not typically induce strong killer T cell immune responses, which are required to produce an effective level of immunization against several difficult pathogens. Administering vaccines through non-mucosal routes often leads to poor protection against mucosal pathogens primarily because such vaccines do not generate memory lymphocytes that migrate to mucosal surfaces. Although mucosal vaccination induces mucosa homing memory lymphocytes, we believe no complete mucosal recombinant oral vaccines are commercially available. Live attenuated vaccines can pose safety risks, whereas killed pathogens or molecular antigens are usually weak immunogens when applied to intact mucosa. Moreover, the immune mechanisms of protection against many mucosal infections are poorly understood.

One of the key benefits of our technology is delivery to the gastrointestinal tract, enabling the vaccine to directly enter the mucosal surface of the intestine and activate the immune system of the gut. Mucosal vaccine delivery is believed to enhance protection against mucosal pathogens by generating immunity at the very surface where such pathogens invade. Our tablet vaccine candidates target the mucosal immune cells with a vector-based approach and are designed to create a more potent cytotoxic T cell response and mucosal antibody response, which may provide more effective immunity for certain diseases. Besides robust mucosal and systemic antibody responses, we observed potent and poly-functional T cell responses in our human clinical trials, demonstrating that our tablet vaccine candidates efficiently activate both B and T cells.
 Oral Non-Replicating Ad5 Vector is Designed to Circumvent Anti-Vector Issues
 Injected Ad5 vectored vaccines generate strong anti-Ad5 responses, with up to a 100-fold increase in the anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibody titers. In contrast, our oral Ad5 vectored vaccine is designed to circumvent the complications related to anti-Ad5 immunity, allowing the platform to be used for multiple vaccines and repeat annual and booster vaccinations. 
 Anti-vector responses have been studied in our H1 influenza Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, as well as in the two norovirus Phase 1 studies. In the first H1 influenza oral tablet vaccine study in 12 subjects, there were no significant rises in the neutralizing antibody titers to Ad5 following immunization. A challenge study was recently performed using the same H1 flu oral tablet vaccine in more than 60 subjects. This study found a 2.2 geometric fold rise in neutralizing antibody titers to Ad5, compared to a rise of 1.1-fold in the placebo group. Finally, the rise in vaccine anti-vector immune responses were monitored in the two Phase 1 norovirus vaccine studies, study #101 and study #102. There were no significant increases in the neutralizing anti-Ad5 antibody titers following either one or two doses of vaccine, even at the high dose (see figure below). 
 Fig. 4. Anti-vector titers pre- and post-immunization. 




Caption. In the single dose 101 study, anti-vector titers were measured 28 days after the only dose. In the two-dose 102 study, these were measured 28 days after the second dose. No significant increase in Ad5 titers were observed in any group in the two studies.
 
In addition, in all studies to date, immune responses to the antigen of choice appeared to be independent from the recipients pre-existing anti-Ad5 immune status. In studies with our Ad5 vectored H1 influenza oral tablet vaccine, the pre-existing antibody titers to Ad5 had no effect on the ability of the vaccine to induce a neutralizing antibody response (by hemagglutinin inhibition or microneutralization assay) to influenza. In the two recently completed Phase 1 studies with our Ad5 vectored norovirus GI.1 oral tablet vaccine, the ability of the vaccine to generate a rise in antibody titers to norovirus or specifically blocking titers to norovirus virus-like particles, or VLP (BT50 assay), was not reduced in subjects with pre-existing anti-Ad5 antibody titers. These results are shown below. In conclusion, performance of our Ad5 vectored vaccine delivered orally does not appear to be adversely affected by the pre-existing serum antibody status of the recipient.

Average increase in the BT50 titers for the Ad5 positive group were not lower than the BT50 Ad5 negative group.
Our Norovirus Program
 Market Overview
 Norovirus is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea from acute gastroenteritis among people of all ages in the United States. Each year, on average, norovirus causes 19 to 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis, and contributes to 56,000 to 71,000 hospitalizations and 570 to 800 deaths, mostly among young children and older adults. Typical symptoms include dehydration, which is the most common complication, vomiting, diarrhea with abdominal cramps, and nausea. In a study conducted by the CDC and Pittsburg School of Medicine in 2012, the total economic burden of norovirus in the United States has been estimated at $5.5 billion. In the U.S., we believe a norovirus vaccine would be beneficial for high risk groups such as children 0-5 years old, older adults and the elderly, as well as for workers in the food and travel industries, for healthcare, childcare and elderly care workers, first responders, the military, and finally leisure travelers as well as business travelers. In a study published by Johns Hopkins University and the CDC in 2016, the total global economic burden of norovirus was estimated at $60 billion, $34 billion of which occurred in high income countries including the United States, Europe and Japan. There are currently no approved vaccines or therapies to prevent or treat norovirus infection.
Our Norovirus Vaccine Candidate
 We plan to develop a VP1-based bivalent oral tablet vaccine that protects against norovirus GI and norovirus GII, the two major norovirus genogroups affecting humans, by targeting the norovirus GI.1 Norwalk strain and the norovirus GII.4 Sydney strain. We believe that our tablet vaccine would have important advantages over the injectable vaccine in development by Takeda. Because norovirus is an enteric pathogen that infects epithelial cells of the small intestine, we believe that a vaccine that produces antibodies in the intestine against norovirus locally in the intestine, such as our tablet vaccine candidate which is delivered directly to the gut, may be optimal at protecting against infection. The main isotype of antibodies found at the intestinal mucosal surface is IgA, whereas the main isotype of protective antibodies found in serum is IgG. We have demonstrated in our seasonal influenza clinical trials and in preclinical norovirus studies that our vaccine candidates can generate mucosal IgA antibodies to the antigen encoded in our vaccine.
Preclinical Results
 We have conducted multiple preclinical studies of our norovirus vaccine candidate in mice and ferrets. Overall, as compared with injectable VP1 protein vaccine, our norovirus vaccine candidate generated comparable levels of serum antibody and superior levels of mucosal antibody to the VP1 injectable protein vaccine. 
Clinical Trials
 We have completed two Phase 1 studies with our monovalent norovirus GI.1 oral tablet vaccine, one of the two strains that will be included in the bivalent vaccine. In both Phase 1 studies, the primary endpoint was safety and the secondary endpoint was immunogenicity.

Study 101. Placebo Controlled Study
 In the Phase 1 study designed to evaluate the norovirus vaccine (VXA-GI.1-NN), 66 healthy adults were randomized in three groups, with 23 subjects receiving a single low dose of 1 x 1010 infectious units, or IU, 23 subjects receiving a single high dose of 1 x 1011 IU, and 20 subjects randomized to the placebo control. 
 Safety Results. 101 Study
 Solicited Events. In the first 7 days following study drug administration, 35 study subjects had at least one solicited adverse event (AE) reported with 25/46 (54%) subjects in the VXA-GI.1-NN vaccine groups and 10/20 (50%) of subjects in the placebo group (See table below). All of the solicited AEs reported (n=46) were grade 1 or 2 in severity with the majority being mild events (44 grade 1 and 2 grade 2 events). The percentage of subjects with any solicited symptoms was similar among treatments (See table below). Diarrhea and headache were the most common solicited symptoms following VXA‑GI.1‑NN administration, both reported by 15 (33%) subjects in the treated groups. Headache and nausea were reported evenly across treatments, including placebo. The only solicited symptom demonstrating a statistically significant difference from placebo was diarrhea (p = 0.0275), reported by 11 subjects in the high dose group. Nine of the 11 subjects reported mild severity diarrhea, while 2 subjects reported moderate severity episodes following the high dose vaccine. Onset of diarrhea (verbatim term loose stools) ranged from day 1 to day 6 following vaccine administration, and most episodes resolved within 1 day. At no point did any of the loose stools impact normal activity such as work or school, and none required treatment with anti-diarrheal medications or rehydration therapy. In summary, the vaccine appeared well-tolerated without causing any dose limiting toxicities.

 Solicited symptoms were collected from subjects for 7 days following immunization. 
 Unsolicited Events. A total of 83 unsolicited Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, or TEAEs, were reported by 33 of the 66 subjects within the first 28 days post dosing, with slightly more placebo subjects 12/20 (60%) reporting AEs than low dose 11/23 (48%) or high dose vaccinated subjects 10/23 (44%). Headache was the most common AE reported in all treatments. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. The PI considered 28 TEAEs possibly related, 42 unlikely related, and 13 not related.
Study 102. Dose and Schedule Optimization
 The study was designed to evaluate the norovirus vaccine (VXA-GI.1-NN) in 60 subjects given multiple doses, with some differences in schedule for the lower dose groups. The first three groups enrolled (N=15 each) used low doses of 1 x 1010 infectious units (IU). Group A received two doses of VXA-GI.1-NN on days 0 and 7, group B received three doses on days 0, 2, and 4, and group C received two doses on days 0 and 28. The fourth group, group D (N=15), evaluated two high doses of 1 x 1011 IU given on days 0 and 28. The vaccine study was an open labeled study, and enrolled more or less sequentially from group A to group D. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the safety of all dosing regimens and the secondary endpoint was to compare immunogenicity between groups by BT50 titers and antibody secreting cells (ASC) counts.

Safety Results. 102 Study
 In the first 7 days following study drug administration, there were 27 subjects reporting adverse events, distributed across the groups with the highest number of reporting adverse events in group C (11/15) and the lowest in group D (3/15). The most common adverse event reported was headache, reported in 21 subjects out of 60. Group C reported the highest number of headaches, and adverse events overall. This group was given two low dose vaccines 28 days apart. This was not observed in group D, a vaccine group given the exact same dosing schedule, but receiving two 10-fold higher doses of vaccine.

Safety Summary from the Two Studies.
 106 subjects were treated with VXA-GI.1-NN in the two norovirus vaccine studies. The vaccine was well tolerated, with no severe adverse events reported in either study. The most common solicited adverse event was headache, but this was relatively similar among all the dosing groups including 40% of subjects receiving the placebo in the 101 study. In the 101 study, there was a higher incidence of diarrhea reported in the high dose group versus the other groups. However, in the high dose group in the 102 study, there was only 1 subject (6.7%) reporting diarrhea even after receiving two high doses. These results in total suggest that there were no dose dependent effects that impacted safety. 
 Immunogenicity Results-Study 101
 BT50 Titers. The primary immunological endpoint was to measure antibody titers by an assay that assessed the ability of antibodies to block interaction of a norovirus VLP to histogroup blood antigen (HGBA). This assay is known as the BT50 (for 50% inhibition of blocking titer) assay. BT50 titers were assessed using Leb synthetic glycan as the coating antigen. Titers rose in the vaccine recipients, and at all timepoints (Figure 6). By the Leb BT50 assay, 14/23 (61%) of the subjects in the low dose group, and 18/23 (78%) in the high dose group, had at least a two-fold rise. One subject in the placebo group had a greater than two-fold rise. On Day 28, the geometric mean titer (GMT) for the low dose vaccine group was 59.0, a 2.3-fold geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) over the initial GMT of 26.2 at baseline. The GMT for the high dose vaccine group was 98.5, a 3.8-fold GMFR over the initial GMT of 25.8 at baseline. The high dose group was significantly increased over placebo on day 28 (P=0.0003). Complete results are given in the table below.

 Antibody Secreting Cell (ASC). The ability of the vaccine to induce norovirus specific B cells in the peripheral blood was measured by ASC assay. This assay essentially counts the number of B cells that emerge after immunization and recognize norovirus in the peripheral blood. The number that circulate in the blood pre-immunization is very low, so the assay is a meaningful way to evaluate the vaccine specific effects. In the low dose group, 16/23 (70%) of subjects responded and in the high dose group, 19/23 (83%) of subjects responded on day 7 for both IgA and IgG ASCs (Figure 7). Background ASCs were generally negligible on day 0. For the high dose vaccine treated group, an average of 561 IgA ASCs and 278 IgG ASCs each per 1 x 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMC, were found on day 7. For the low dose vaccine treated group, an average of 372 IgA ASCs and 107 IgG ASCs were found on day 7. The placebo group had no responders with an average of 3.3 spots for IgA ASCs and 2.2 spots for IgG ASCs per 1 x 106 PBMC on day 7. The treated groups were significantly different than placebo in terms of the ability to elicit an IgG or an IgA ASC response at day 7 (P<0.0001, Mann-Whitney). There was no statistical difference in the number of spots for IgA and IgG ASCs between the high and low dose groups (P=0.21 for IgA, P=0.28 for IgG). 
 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgA and IgG. Serum antibody responses were measured by IgG and IgA ELISA, and the changes in titers at EC50 between days 0 and 28 were calculated for each subject. Most subjects had an increase in antibody titers post immunization. The average change in EC50 for the low dose group was 16 and 7.1-fold in IgA and IgG respectively. Similarly, the average change in the EC50 for the high dose group were 9 and 5.4-fold for IgA and IgG respectively. The change in EC50 are plotted for each subject, separated by group (Figure 8).
 Memory Cells. Memory cells are long-lived cells that are important for the rapid induction of immunity following infection. A goal of most vaccines is to safely induce immunological memory to protect people from actual infection. Antigen specific memory B cells were investigated after culturing PMBCs with polyclonal stimulators. VP1 specific IgG memory B cells were higher than IgA memory B cells in the day 0 samples (Figure 9). Post immunization, the response at day 7 was higher for IgA memory B cells, with a geometric mean fold rise, or GMFR, of 15.3 for IgA versus 6.5 for IgG between day 0 and 7, before declining again at day 28. In the low dose group, the GMFR was 7.4 for IgA and 3.7 for IgG was observed between days 0 and 7. This decline from day 7 to day 28 may have resulted from homing of circulating B cells from the peripheral blood to the intestinal lymphoid tissues via expression of high levels of the mucosal homing receptor, a4b7. In the high dose group at day 7, 20/23 (87%) IgA and 19/23 (83%) for IgG showed ≥ 2-fold increase over day 0. In the low dose group at day 7, 18/23 (78%) for IgA and 13/23 (57%) for IgG showed ≥2-fold increase over day 0. 
 Fecal and Saliva IgA. Norovirus VP1 specific mucosal IgA was explored directly by looking at fecal and saliva samples. Because the quantity of IgA is highly variable within these samples, total IgA was also measured and the ratio between VP1- specific IgA/total IgA for each sample was examined. Samples with IgA levels below the detection limit were excluded from analysis. The increase in the ratio of specific IgA to total IgA was measured between baseline and day 28 (and baseline and day 180 for fecal IgA). In the high dose group, 9/19 (47%) fecal samples were responders with a four-fold rise or greater IgA response at day 28, and 9/21 (43%) at day 180 (Figure 10). The average fold increases in specific IgA/total IgA ratio were 17.2 and 9.7. These results are significantly higher than the placebo group where 2/18 (11%) and 0/16 (0%) were found to have 4-fold or better increases on days 28 and 180 (P=0.029 and P=0.0049 respectively), with average increases of 1.8 and 1.0 (Figure 10). The low dose group had a similar response as the high dose, with 7/20 (35%) and 5/16 (31%) with 4-fold or greater increases on days 28, and 180 respectively. The number of responders trended higher than placebo on day 28, but the difference was statistically significant on day 180 (P=0.13 and 0.043). The low dose group had a 36.2-fold increase on day 28, and a 5.6-fold increase on day 180 (Figure 10). Fewer subjects had detectable increases in the specific IgA to total IgA ratios in saliva samples of treated subjects at day 28 (Figure 11). The average increase in the specific IgA/total IgA ratio was 2.0 for the low dose, 2.9 for the high dose group, and 1.2 for the placebo group. The high dose and low dose groups had each had 4 subjects with a 4-fold rise in the specific response, versus none for the placebo group. These results demonstrate that the vaccine can induce antibody responses that are measured in the mucosa, particularly in the intestinal mucosa, which is the site of norovirus infection.

 Immunological Results - 102 Study
 BT50 Titers. The objective of the study was to compare schedules and dosing for the ability to elicit immune responses, particularly by evaluating BT50 titers. BT50 titers were assessed at multiple times points, given that multiple doses were given. In the high dose group, 12 of 15 subjects had a 2-fold or greater increase in BT50 titers after the first dose and 14 of 15 subjects (92%) had a 2-fold or greater increase in BT50 titers after 2 doses. The GMT titer rose from 21.3 on day to 85.1 on day 28 for a 3.8 GMFR. The GMT at day 56 were measured to be 75.8, a GMFR of 3.6 over the baseline values. Other groups given lower doses of vaccine had lower response rates. Groups A and C had higher increases in the titers compared to Group B, although this is not statistically significant. An ANCOVA model was used to determine the statistical significance of the increases in GMFR. Least-squares, or LS, geometric mean titers, or LSGMTs, and LS geometric mean fold rises (LSGMFRs) were calculated by exponentiating the LSMs from the ANCOVA model, which included log-transformed post baseline titer or log-transformed change from baseline titer as a dependent variable, cohort as a factor, and baseline log-titer as a covariate. The significance in the different groups to increase the GMFR (test is LSGMFR=0), was found to be P=0.0008, 0.1224, 0.0004, and <0.0001 for groups A through D respectively at day 56. This means all groups had statistically significant increases in the GMT with the exception of group B, which had a more modest increase in the titers.

ASCs. Additional immunological analysis was performed by comparing the ASC responders between groups. The high dose group had 14 out of 15 subjects respond to the vaccine, with an average IgA ASC count of 698 per 1X106 cells. Following a second dose, the subject that didnt respond the first time had a significant increase in ASC counts so all 15 subjects (100%) were able to elicit an ASC response following two doses. As typical, subjects that had a high number of ASC counts after the first immunization had a low response after the 2nd dose. The low dose groups were compared by examining the overall response rate, since the dosing and the analysis were performed at different intermediate timepoints. Group A had the highest overall response rate where 12/14 subjects (86%) were able to induce meaningful ASC responses after 1 or 2 doses. Slightly lower responders were observed in group B, where only a few subjects had a response after the first dose, but more subjects responded after additional vaccine doses. Group C had the most variable responses of any group. The average number of spots was 839 per 1X106 cells after the first dose, but this was the result of several subjects having extremely high numbers of spots (3 subjects had greater than 1500 per 1X106), mixed with many subjects that didnt respond at all.
 By Fishers Exact test, the high dose group induced a higher number of responders than group C p=0.02), but only trended higher than groups A and B (0.22, 0.07). Similar results were observed for the IgG ASC responses, with slightly lower values on average.

 Norovirus Oral Tablet Vaccine Clinical Development Pathway
 Phase 1 Bivalent Norovirus Trial. The bivalent Phase 1 trial is designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the two individual GI.1 and GII.4 norovirus vaccines, and to evaluate potential interference between the two vaccines. The trial is scheduled to begin during the first half of 2019. 
 Phase 2 Norovirus GI.1 strain Challenge Study. We plan to commence a challenge study with our monovalent GI.1 norovirus vaccine candidate in the first half of 2019. 
 Phase 2 Efficacy and Safety Trial. After successfully completing the trials described above, a Phase 2 trial would be conducted. This trial will be designed to assess the safety, immunogenicity and possibly the efficacy of the bivalent vaccine in an expanded population of adults ranging in age from 18 to 49 years.
 Path to Approval. After completing the Phase 2 trial, we expect to request an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to discuss the design of a Phase 3 trial that would support licensure. 
Additional Age Groups
 ·      Older Adults, Elderly Population. Following successful completion of the bivalent Phase 1 trial in healthy adults age 18  49, we plan to conduct sequential Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in healthy adults age 50  64 years and age 65 and older, designed to support licensure of our tablet vaccine candidate for these age groups. Following these studies, we expect to engage in discussions with the FDA to determine the requirements for Phase 3 and licensure.
 ·      Pediatric Population. Our current tablet vaccine candidates are designed for delivery to the gut in solid dosage form using an enteric-coated tablet which we believe is the optimal vaccine delivery system for the adult population and children 8 years and older. For children 6 months to 8 years in age, we plan to develop proprietary liquid formulations that can deliver the vectored vaccine intact to the gut. Development of our norovirus vaccine product candidate in the pediatric population will proceed stepwise through progressively younger age segments (i.e. 9-17 years, 5-8 years, 2-4 years, 6 weeks-2 years).
Our Seasonal Influenza Program
 Market Overview
 Influenza is one of the most common global infectious diseases, causing mild to life-threatening illness with symptoms such as sore throat, nasal discharge, fever, and even death. It is estimated that at least 350 million cases of seasonal influenza occur annually worldwide, of which 3 million to 5 million cases are considered severe, causing 290,000 to 650,000 deaths per year globally. Very young children and the elderly are at greatest risk from death. In the United States, between 5% and 20% of the population contracts influenza, 226,000 people are hospitalized with complications of influenza, and between 3,000 and 49,000 people die from influenza and its complications each year, with up to 90% of influenza-related deaths occurring in adults older than 65.
 
16
 

According to a CDC commissioned-report based on 2003 population figures, in the United States, seasonal influenza costs an average of over 600,000 life-years lost, 3.1 million hospitalized days, and 31.4 million outpatient visits annually. The total economic burden of seasonal influenza has been estimated to be $87.1 billion, including medical costs which average $10.4 billion annually, while lost earnings due to illness and loss of life amount to $16.3 billion annually.
 The CDC generally recommends that individuals 6 months and older be vaccinated annually against influenza. In the U.S., this means an influenza vaccination is recommended for more than 300 million people. During the 2017/2018 influenza season, approximately 137 million doses of the influenza vaccine were delivered in the United States. Differentiated flu vaccines in the U.S. market continue to demonstrate the ability to ask for premium prices based on the additional value they provide to public health. According to a 2017 Datamonitor Healthcare report the seasonal influenza vaccines market within the United States and five major European Union markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK) will increase from $2.7 billion in the 2016/17 season to $3.4 billion in the 2025/26 season. We believe, worldwide, the primary drivers of market growth include increasing awareness, increasing vaccination coverage in emerging countries, rising government support for immunization against seasonal influenza, pricing increases due to product differentiation and increased focus on the production and advancement of vaccination treatments.
 Limitations of Current Seasonal Influenza Vaccines
 Despite the number of cases of influenza diagnosed in the United States, according to the CDC, in the 2017/2018 seasonal influenza season, only approximately 42% of the total U.S. population was vaccinated against influenza, with particularly low vaccination rates among adults between ages 18 and 49. According to the CDC, less than 27% of adults between ages 18 and 49 were vaccinated during the 2017/2018 influenza season. We believe the low vaccination rates among this population are largely attributed to the following limitations of injectable vaccine administration:
Limitations for Providers
 ·      longer manufacturing, shipping and handling time for suppliers;
 ·      cold storage requirement throughout the logistics chain;
 ·      the need for healthcare professional oversight during and after the vaccination procedure;
 ·      potential for needle injuries; and
 ·      medical waste.
 Limitations for Users
 ·      inconvenience and time commitment required to obtain vaccine at a clinic or pharmacy;
 ·      fear of needles;
 ·      pain at injection site; and
 ·      potential for allergic reactions to the egg component of the vaccine.
 Our Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Candidate
 We are developing a tablet vaccine candidate for the immunization of healthy adults against seasonal influenza. Our seasonal influenza vaccine candidate is being designed to cover the four-strain, or quadrivalent, seasonal influenza vaccine consisting of two circulating influenza A lineage viruses as well as two circulating influenza B lineage viruses, matching the seasonally updated recommendations by the FDA. We envision formulating our tablet vaccine candidate as one tablet per strain, or four tablets in total for the quadrivalent vaccine. We believe this modularity will allow for enhanced flexibility. For instance, in the event of a late season strain change, the tablet containing the obsolete strain could be easily replaced without having to discard the three correctly matched vaccine tablets. Further, given stability of the tablets, excess tablets from one season could be stored and utilized in the next season, while fully formulated quadrivalent vaccines would have to be discarded at the end of each season as is the case with currently marketed influenza vaccines. Alternatively, we have the option to formulate all four strains into a single tablet. This format would be the simplest to administer, but would take away some of the flexibility advantages that separate tablets would afford. We will assess the final formulation of our tablet vaccine candidates after conducting market studies to evaluate market acceptance closer to commercialization.
 
17
 
We believe our tablet vaccine candidates have the potential to address many of the limitations of current injectable, egg-based seasonal influenza vaccines. First, our tablet vaccine candidates are designed to create broad and durable immune responses, which may provide more effective immunity and protect against additional strain variants. Second, by providing a more convenient method of administration to enhance patient acceptance and simplify distribution and administration. Finally, by using recombinant methods, we believe our tablet vaccine candidates may be manufactured more rapidly than vaccines manufactured using egg-based methods, eliminate the risk of allergic reactions to egg protein, and alleviate issues caused by egg-adaptation of a mammalian virus.
 Seasonal Influenza Clinical Trials
 To date, we have completed two Phase 1 trials and have conducted the active portion of a Phase 2 challenge trial of our H1N1 influenza vaccine candidate. We have also completed a Phase 1 trial of an influenza B vaccine candidate.
 Phase 1 Trial, VXA02-001, H1N1 Influenza Vaccine Candidate, 109 and 1010 IU Doses
 The first Phase 1 H1N1 trial was conducted at doses of 1 x 109 and 1 x 1010 IU. Two doses were given one month apart. The tablet vaccine candidate generated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The trial also demonstrated robust T cell responses and modest hemagglutination inhibition assay, or HAI, responses, each dependent on the dosage level. 
 Phase 1 Trial VXA02-003, H1N1 Influenza Vaccine Candidate, 1011 IU Dose
 The second H1N1 trial was a tablet vaccine trial at a dose of 1 x 1011 IU, delivered in a single administration. We observed a favorable safety and tolerability profile at this dose level. An HAI seroconversion rate of 75% was measured in the vaccine group, compared to 0% in the placebo group. 92% of subjects had a four-fold increase in Micro Neutralization, or MN, titer after the single administration of tablets. Both the HAI seroconversion rate and the MN responses were substantially higher than the respective rates that we observed at lower doses in Trial VXA02-001. The side effects of the vaccine or placebo in the first seven days following administration were mild with no serious adverse effects. In the first seven days following administration, there were eight total solicited adverse events, or AEs, reported in the vaccine and placebo groups (four in each group). All of these AEs were grade 1 in severity. The most frequent AE was headache (two in placebo, and one in the vaccine group). There were no serious adverse events and no new onsets of chronic illnesses related to the adjuvant recorded during the entire one year follow up period of the study.
 The table below summarizes the trial design and results (serum antibody responses) of our two placebo-controlled Phase 1 H1N1 clinical trials.

Phase 1 Trial. Influenza B
 In 2015 and 2016, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial to test the safety and immunogenicity of an influenza B tablet vaccine. A total of 54 healthy adults age 18-49 were enrolled, with 38 receiving the vaccine and 16 receiving placebo. To participate in this trial, subjects were required to have an initial HAI measure of no greater than 1:20. The active phase of the trial was through day 28, with the follow-up phase for monitoring safety to continue for one year. All subjects who received the vaccine received a single dose of either 1 x 10 10 IU or 1 x 1011 IU on Day 0.

Safety. The side effects of the vaccine or placebo in the first seven days following administration were generally mild with no serious adverse events. There were no notable differences between the active dose groups and placebo in safety and tolerability.
 HAI. In the placebo group, HAI GMT remained essentially unchanged (1:33) at day 28 post dosing. The GMFR of HAI titers both active treated groups at day 28 post dosing was about 2‑fold, and independent of dose. For the vaccinated groups receiving either 1×1010 IU or 1×1011 IU, seroconversion was observed in 5/19 subjects (26.3%) and 3/19 subjects (15.8%), respectively. There were no seroconversions in the placebo group.
 Antibody Secreting Cells (ASCs). In order to measure total antibody responses to HA, the numbers of circulating B cells that recognize influenza HA in peripheral blood were measured by ASC assay on days 0 and 7 after immunization. Results show that ASCs could be reliably measured on day 7 in the vaccine-treated groups. Background ASCs were generally negligible on day 0. By IgG ASC, 68% of 1×1010 IU dose subjects responded, and 84% of subjects in the 1×1011 IU dose group responded. For the 1×1011 IU dose vaccine treated group, an average of 21 IgA ASCs (95% CI: 7  35) and 73 IgG ASCs (95% CI: 35  111) each per 1×106 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were found at day 7. For the 1×1010 IU dose vaccine treated group, an average of 16 IgA ASCs (95% CI: 2  29) and 44 IgG ASCs (95% CI: 21  66) were found at day 7. The placebo group had no responders, and negligible average number of spots (1 or less) on Day 7 (95% CI: -0.6  -2).
 H1N1 Influenza Phase 2 Challenge Study Funded by BARDA
 In 2015, we were awarded a $13.9 million contract by BARDA, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This two-year contract was awarded under a Broad Agency Announcement issued to support the advanced development of more effective influenza vaccines to improve seasonal and pandemic influenza preparedness. The contract primarily funded a Phase 2 challenge study in human volunteers, designed to evaluate whether our H1N1 tablet vaccine candidate offers broader and more durable protection than currently marketed injectable vaccines. The contract with BARDA was subsequently increased to $15.7 million and the term was extended until September 2018.
 In this Phase 2 study, volunteers were randomized into three groups. One group received our oral H1N1 influenza tablet vaccine candidate, a second group received a commercially licensed inactivated influenza vaccine by intramuscular injection, and a third group received placebo. Three months following immunization, volunteers were challenged (deliberate experimental administration) with live H1N1 (A/H1N1 pdm09) influenza virus by intranasal administration. The placebo group served as the control group to determine how many unvaccinated volunteers became infected and how severe their influenza symptoms became. Data from our vaccine candidate group and the commercially licensed inactivated vaccine group were compared to placebo to determine each vaccines efficacy in this challenge study. Importantly, the two vaccines were also compared head-to-head. The goal of the study is to compare the efficacy of our vaccine to protect volunteers from illness caused by H1N1 influenza challenge, compared to both the injectable vaccine and placebo three months after immunization.
 Clinical Trial Results VXA-CHAL-201
 The Phase 2 challenge study was enrolled during 2016 and 2017. During this time, 179 subjects that cleared the screening requirements were randomized to receive a single dose of our tablet vaccine, the commercial injectable vaccine, or placebo. Of these 179 subjects, 143 subjects were subsequently challenged with live H1N1 influenza virus 90 to 120 days months after dosing. 
 ·      Safety. The side effects of the vaccines or placebo in the first seven days following administration were generally mild. In the first seven days following administration, the solicited adverse events (AEs) reported in the vaccine and placebo groups were mostly grade 1 in severity, and none were above grade 2. The most frequent solicited AE was headache in our tablet vaccine group (7%), injection site tenderness in the commercially licensed inactivated vaccine group (26%) and headache in the placebo group (19%). There were no serious adverse events and no new onsets of chronic illnesses related to our vaccine adjuvant recorded during the follow up period of the study. The graphs below show the distribution and severity over time of local and systemic (Figures 14 and 15) solicited AEs.

 Efficacy  Reduction of PCR Confirmed Influenza Illness. 
 The primary efficacy objective was to determine vaccine efficacy of our tablet vaccine following the challenge with the wild-type influenza A H1 virus strain (A/H1N1 pdm09). The primary efficacy endpoint was illness. The illness rate was 29% for our tablet vaccine, 35% for the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine, and 48% for subjects in the placebo group. Our tablet vaccine had a lower rate of illness than the commercial vaccine (-6% difference in illness rate in favor of our vaccine), although given the small size of the study, these differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, the difference in illness rates between our tablet vaccine and placebo (-19.1%) and the commercial injected vaccine and placebo (-13.2%) trended toward protection but were not statistically significant. These results suggest that our vaccine is no worse, and trended better than the commercial vaccine for protection. The ability to show clinical efficacy in humans is a major step forward for our oral influenza product. These results are summarized in the table below.

  Table 6. H1 Influenza Phase 2 Challenge Study: Illness Rates*.
  
VAXART | Commercial | VAXART-Commercial | Placebo 
-------+-------------------+-------------------+------------------
n | % (95% CI) | n | % (95% CI) | Rate Difference (95% CI) | n | % (95% CI) 
58 | 29.3 (18.1, 42.7) | 54 | 35.2 (22.7, 49.4) | -5.9 (-24.3, 12.5) | 31 | 48.4 (30.2, 66.9)

 *Illness was defined as a combination of symptoms reported on a patient reported outcome tool (Flu-PROTM) and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) detectable shed influenza virus.
 Efficacy  Flu-PRO symptom Scores
 There were no statistically significant differences between the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine and our tablet vaccine for the Flu-PRO questionnaire, a validated patient recorded outcome tool used in influenza clinical trials in the community. However, our vaccine trended lower for overall symptom severity. Subjects in the VXA-A1.1 group showed a lower overall median Flu-PRO score (2.0 [0, 72]) than the QIV group (5.0 [0, 59]) or the placebo group (5.0 [0, 52]). 
 Efficacy  Shedding
 Shedding represents influenza virus that is detected in nasal swabs post infection and is representative of viral infection and replication. In the study, 44.8% of subjects in VXA-A1.1 had at least one day positive for shedding, versus the commercial injected vaccine where 53.7% were positive for shedding and where 71.0% of placebo subjects were positive for shedding. There were no statistically significant differences observed between our tablet vaccine and the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine for viral shedding area under the curve (AUC). However, AUC was calculated using a standard logarithmic trapezoidal method and included only detectable shedding during the first 5 days of the duration of shedding, with subjects removed from the analysis that didnt shed influenza for 5 days (a zero value cannot be used in log calculations and integrated). This may have led to an underestimate of the effect on viral shedding for the two vaccines relative to placebo. Therefore, in order to better determine the effect of the vaccines on shedding, an alternative method was used in which volunteers were defined as infected if they had detectable viral shedding at any time 36 hours after challenge. This approach eliminated possible issues related to calculations (log calculations of zero values) and of large doses of challenge virus (first 36 hours might be pass through rather than replicating influenza). In a Bayesian analysis, both vaccines significantly reduced the probability of shedding relative to placebo (Bayesian posterior p=0.001 for our tablet vaccine and p=0.009 for the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine). There is also trend toward greater efficacy for our vaccine with an ~80% posterior probability (Table 7).
 Table 7. H1 Influenza Phase 2 Challenge Study: Infection Rates*.
  
Treatment Arm | N | Number Infected | Percent (95% CI) | Posterior P
---------------+----+-----------------+------------------+------------
Placebo | 31 | 22 | 71% (55-85%) | - 
Commercial | 54 | 24 | 44% (32-58%) | 0.009 
Vaxart Vaccine | 58 | 21 | 36% (24-49%) | 0.001 

 
*Infection was defined as any positive quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) detectable shed influenza virus on any day after 36 hours from viral challenge. In a Bayesian analysis, both vaccines provide a statistically significant protection against infection. There is also trend toward greater efficacy for our vaccine with an ~80% posterior probability.
 Immunogenicity
 HAI responses. HAI measures the ability of serum antibodies that can disrupt binding of influenza virus to red blood cells. Historically, HAI correlates to protection for injected influenza vaccines. HAI responses were measured 30 days following immunization to determine the number and percentage of volunteers that seroconverted. In our tablet vaccine group, 32% of volunteers achieved seroconversion. In the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine group 84% of volunteers achieved HAI seroconversion at 30 days post vaccination. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001, Fishers Exact test). There were no subjects in the placebo group who achieved seroconversion at 30 days post vaccination. Since 32% of subjects seroconverted in the Vaxart tablet vaccine group achieved HAI seroconversion, but 71% of subjects were protected from illness following influenza challenge, HAI seroconversion appeared not to be a reliable indicator of protection for the Vaxart vaccine. The table below summarizes the HAI data. The GMT, GMFR, percentage of volunteers who had a 4-fold rise in their HAI and the percentage of subjects who seroconverted are reported.

IgA Antibody Secreting Cells. B cells specific for influenza HA (IgA antibody secreting cells or IgA ASCs) were measured at baseline and 8 days following immunization in order to determine the B cell responses to the vaccines. At 8 days following vaccination, subjects in the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine group had significantly higher mean numbers of spots per 106 cells (p<0.001, Wilcoxon test) and significantly higher percentages of subjects with greater than 8 spots per 106 cells (p<0.001, Fisher exact). At Day 8, the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine group had mean spots 286 per 106 cells compared to mean spots of 116 per 106 cells for the Vaxart tablet vaccine. Additionally, the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine group had a 96% response rate compared to 71% in the Vaxart tablet vaccine group. The table below summarizes these data.
 Table 9. ASC Response for IgA and IgG Assays by Study Day and Treatment Group  Vaccination Phase.

 | Baseline (Pre-Dosing) | Day 8 (Post-Dosing)
Assay | Treatment Group | N | Mean | Median [Range] | At Least 8 Spotsn (%) | N | Mean | Median [Range] | At Least 8 Spotsn (%)
IgA ASC | Vaxart Tablet Vaccine | 70 | 2.0 | 0.0 [0, 18] | 6 (8.6) | 70 | 116.0 | 32.0 [0, 3251] | 50 (71.4) 
Commercial Inactivated Influenza Vaccine | 71 | 1.5 | 0.0 [0, 13] | 8 (11.3) | 71 | 286.4 | 153.0 [3, 1753] | 68 (95.8) 
Placebo | 36 | 2.8 | 0.0 [0, 26] | 6 (16.7) | 36 | 16.3 | 1.0 [0, 256] | 8 (22.2) 

 Correlation of IgA ASCs with Illness for the Vaxart Tablet Vaccine. As stated above the absolute mean number of ASCs was higher for the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine group (286 spots per 106 cells) than for the Vaxart tablet vaccine (116 spots per 106 cells). However, when a comparison was made between the two vaccines of the ratio of IgA ASCs in volunteers that were not ill divided by volunteers that were ill following challenge, the Vaxart tablet vaccine group had a ratio of 4.7 versus a ratio of 1.4 for the commercial injected vaccine. In a logistics fit model with illness versus non-illness as the outcome, and IgA ASC as the independent variable, the model showed that the Vaxart tablet vaccine IgA ASC could predict ill versus non-ill, but the logistics fit model for the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine could not (p=0.0005 for our vaccine, p=0.3066 for the commercial injected vaccine for whole logistic model). These data suggest that IgA ASC is important for protection against influenza for our oral vaccine, but not for injected commercial vaccines. These data also suggest that there are qualitative differences between B cells induced post immunization by different methods. We are actively exploring these qualitative differences.

 Preclinical Results
 We have completed several animal challenge studies for influenza. In an H1N1 influenza challenge study, mice immunized orally with our tablet vaccine candidate were protected against sickness and death compared to unimmunized, control animals. Similarly, our oral H5N1 vaccine candidate protected ferrets and mice against a lethal avian influenza challenge compared to unimmunized animals when the vaccine construct expressed an avian influenza HA construct.
Cross Protection of Vaxart Quadrivalent Seasonal Flu Vaccine against Avian Flu in Ferret Challenge Model
 A more recent ferret challenge experiment was completed in 2017 to compare an oral quadrivalent vaccine that we designed with the commercial vaccine Fluzone for protection against a virulent avian influenza strain. There are no components of seasonal influenza vaccines that are matched to the HA made by avian influenza virus, so the virus represents a severe case of vaccine mismatched to virus. Our quadrivalent vaccine was made by mixing four recombinant adenoviruses, each expressing a different HA that matches the HAs in the commercial vaccine, not the HA of the challenge. Two different doses were evaluated; the high dose was used at 1:10 of a Vaxart human dose (Vaxart Quad) and the low dose (Vaxart Quad Low) was used at 1:100 of the human dose. The Fluzone group (QIV) was given at 1:10 of the human dose to directly compare to the Vaxart quadrivalent high dose group. Vaxart animals and the negative control (PBS) animals were given vaccine delivered by endoscope. The QIV animals were intramuscularly injected. Animals were vaccinated on days 0 and 28. Animals were challenged on day 56 with approximately 102.69 TCID50/mL of wild type A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (A/VN). Results show that the Vaxart quadrivalent vaccines were able to protect against mismatched A/VN, trending better than Fluzone. The high dose group was able to protect all ferrets against death whereas the low dose Vaxart group protected 75% of ferrets.

 Seasonal Influenza Clinical Development Strategy and Pathway
 We aim to partner and/or to obtain funding from the U.S. federal government to finance the development and commercialization of our seasonal quadrivalent influenza oral tablet vaccine. In the future, we may also consider equity offerings and/or debt financings to fund the program. 
Our Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Therapeutic Vaccine Candidate 
 In previous clinical studies with our H5 influenza vaccine candidate, we observed robust T-cell responses that appeared to compare favorably with published results of other flu vaccines, including an adjuvanted vaccine as well as an attenuated live viral vaccine. Specifically, our vaccine generated high levels of polyfunctional cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 cells, T-cells that are likely required to obtain a therapeutic benefit in chronic viral infection and cancer. It was based on these observations that we embarked on the development of our first therapeutic vaccine, targeting HPV -associated dysplasia and cervical cancer. 
Medical Need, Commercial Opportunity
 HPV is a family of more than 120 viruses which are extremely common globally. At least 13 HPV types are cancer-causing. HPV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact and infection is very prevalent following the onset of sexual activity. Nearly all cases of cervical cancer are attributable to HPV infection, with two HPV types  HPV16 and HPV18  responsible for 70% of cervical cancers and precancerous cervical lesions. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, and about 13,000 new cases are diagnosed annually in the United States according to the National Cervical Cancer Coalition. Studies have indicated a high lifetime probability of any HPV infection by both men and women in the United States, with some estimates indicating at least 80% of women and men acquire HPV by age 45. The CDC estimates 80 million U.S. citizens are currently infected with HPV, representing 25% of the population, with about 14 million new infections per year. A report by BCC Research expects the global cervical cancer drug and diagnostic market to exceed $15 billion by 2018. 
 In women, many HPV infections of the cervix will spontaneously resolve and clear within 2-3 years, but women who have a persistent infection are at high risk of developing cellular abnormalities known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) which can progress to invasive cancer over time. More than 400,000 women are diagnosed with CIN annually in the United States, with an annual incidence estimate for CIN1 and CIN2/3 at 1.6 and 1.2 per 1,000 women, respectively.
 There are currently no approved therapeutic vaccines to treat HPV infection. Current treatment options for women infected with HPV (see below) include monitoring CIN status, surgical procedures to remove affected tissue, and chemotherapeutic or radiation therapies to treat localized or metastatic cervical cancer. Thus, a medical need remains for a therapeutic vaccine to treat women presenting with CIN, or who have progressed to cervical cancer.
 
24
 
Our HPV Therapeutic Vaccine Candidate
 Our plan is to develop a bivalent HPV vaccine against HPV 16 and 18, the strains responsible for approximately 70% of cases of cervical cancer. We plan to target the E6 and E7 gene products of each strain, which are the primary oncogenic proteins responsible for progression through the stages of CIN to invasive cervical cancer. In pre-clinical studies, we have demonstrated immunogenicity for both our HPV16 and our HPV18 vaccine candidates. Specifically, mice given our HPV16 or HPV18 vaccines induced T cell responses to HPV as measured by IFN gamma ELISPOT. In addition, our HPV16 vaccine has demonstrated tumor growth suppression as well as increased survival in a robust HPV tumor model in mice. We believe that our HPV vaccine has several advantages over current treatment options for both CIN and cervical cancer. Current treatment options for CIN are invasive and can lead to serious contraindications for pregnancy. In addition, surgical treatments for CIN do not treat the underlying HPV, but rather remove infected tissue. As a result, current CIN treatment options have a significant failure rate which can increase the risk for progression to cervical cancer. Our vaccines have demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in clinical subjects dosed to date. Current treatment options for cervical cancer, such as chemotherapy and radiation treatment, have multiple side effects such as hair loss, loss of appetite, and severe nausea.
 T cells responses to HPV-16 can shrink solid tumors derived from transformed HPV
 The ability of T cell responses to HPV-16 to produce a therapeutic response was tested in a solid tumor growth model. TC-1 cells (an HPV-16 transformed cell-line) were injected subcutaneously into the hind flank of B6 mice, and allowed to grow for several days before mice were immunized with vaccine or controls. In study 1, mice were immunized on days 7, 14, and 21. For groups 4 and 5, the vaccine expressed the HPV16 antigens E6/E7 (Ad-HPV). A checkpoint inhibitor (an antibody to PD-1) was used along with the vaccine in group 5, and an isotype control (Iso) to the checkpoint inhibitor was used in group 4. A recombinant rAd vector identical to Ad-HPV, but which doesnt express the HPV antigens (Ad-nr), was used in groups 1 or 2 to control for non-specific effects. Untreated animals were not given any vaccine.
 The results in study 1 showed that Ad-HPV groups were able to the stop tumor growth, and actually shrink the tumor. This occurred whether the checkpoint inhibitor was used or not. The checkpoint inhibitor alone was not able to stop tumor progression, and eventually all these animals perished. Other control animals without Ad-HPV didnt survive as well. The use of the checkpoint inhibitor with the Ad-HPV vaccine trended slightly better for survival (10/10 versus 9/10 survived), but this was not significant.
 In study 2, the TC-1 tumor was transplanted as before, but allowed to grow longer before immunization occurred. Immunizations occurred on days 13, 20, and 27. In this study, mice that received the Ad-HPV vaccine plus the checkpoint inhibitor were able to control the tumor, up through day 40 before a few mice started to perish. More than 70% of animals in this group survived through the end of the experiment on day 80. Ad-HPV immunized mice in the absence of the checkpoint inhibitor were also able to substantially control the tumor through 60 days (33 days after the last immunization), before several additional animals perished. No control groups in the absence of the Ad-HPV were able to control any of the tumors, and all mice perished before day 40.
 Fig. 18.  Small Tumor Vaccine Study.


Caption.  In the small tumor vaccine study (Study 1), tumors were allowed to grow for 7 days before beginning the immunization schedule. Animals given the Vaxart HPV vaccine (Ad-HPV) were protected against tumor growth and survived better. This was the case whether or not a checkpoint inhibitor was used.

Fig. 19.  Large Tumor Vaccine Study.



Caption.  In the large tumor vaccine study (Study 2), tumors were allowed to grow for 13 days before the vaccines were given. Again, animals given the Ad-HPV were better protected against tumor growth. The addition of the checkpoint inhibitor improved survival.
 The T cells induced post immunization in the tumor model were believed to traffic back to the solid tumor to attack and destroy the cancer cells. This was tested in an additional tumor model experiment. Tumors were transplanted as before, and immunizations were performed on days 13 and 21. Tumors were harvested from the experiment on day 24, and flow cytometry was used to enumerate the T cells infiltrating the tumors. The HPV16 vaccine groups (with either the checkpoint inhibitor or an isotype control antibody) had T cell infiltrates of both CD4 and CD8 positive T cells. The CD8 T cell numbers from the Ad-HPV groups were significantly better than control treated animals in terms of infiltrating lymphocytes. The CD4 T cells were significantly better in the Ad-HPV + checkpoint group, and trended higher in the Ad-HPV + isotype control group.
 Fig. 20.  The Ad-HPV vaccine induces T cells that migrate to the tumors.


Caption.  The number of CD4 and CD8 T cells found within the tumor were analyzed by flow cytometry. The Ad-HPV groups were found to elicit T cells that transited to the tumor, with the Ad-HPV plus checkpoint inhibitor creating slightly more T cell transit than the Ad-HPV vaccine alone.

Near Term HPV Vaccine Development Strategy
 Preclinical 
 The next steps in the vaccine development are to complete the nonclinical studies, which may include a Good Laboratory Practices, GLP, toxicology study, to support an investigational new drug, or IND, filing for this vaccine. The exact nature of these studies will be determined in consultation with the FDA. 
Clinical 
 We will propose to test the vaccine in subjects with cervical dysplasia related to HPV16 or HPV18, and to evaluate the ability of the vaccine to clear HPV infection, reduce the cervical dysplasia score, and induce T cells known to be important in the clearance of HPV. T cells will be measured by flow cytometry as well as by IFN-g ELISPOT. The primary endpoint will be safety and the secondary endpoint will be immunogenicity by examining T cell responses. Although clinical responses will be tracked, it is expected that the first study may not be powered to obtain statistically significant efficacy readouts. 
Other Indications
 We currently have preliminary data in animal models for indications such as RSV, Chikungunya, Hepatitis B and HSV-2.
 
Manufacturing 
 Manufacturing our oral tablet vaccines consists of two main stages, the production of bulk vaccine (drug substance), and the formulation and tableting thereof (drug product). Drug substance manufacturing consists primarily of the production and purification of the active ingredient. Bulk drug substance is then lyophilized, formulated and subsequently tableted and coated using a proprietary formulation and tableting process that we developed. 
 From 2012 through December of 2017, we relied on a third-party contract manufacturer, Lonza Houston, Inc. or Lonza Houston, to manufacture clinical bulk drug substance for our tablet vaccine candidates. During 2017 and early 2018, we developed our own bulk vaccine manufacturing process and then established a cGMP bulk manufacturing facility at our corporate headquarters in California. We believe having an in-house bulk facility provides a number of important strategic advantages, including control of our manufacturing schedule and enhanced integration of process development and cGMP manufacturing operations.
 Our facility is fully operational and was used to make our norovirus GII.4 vaccine tablets and the norovirus GI.1 bulk vaccine lots that are scheduled to be processed and tableted in the first quarter of 2019.  However, we have not yet achieved the productivity levels we initially projected and we continue to seek improvements in productivity. We are also making modifications to our purification process to further improve purity and yield.
 Our facility and equipment is sized to support manufacturing of cGMP product for our Phase 1 and Phase 2a trials, but is not adequate to support larger Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials.  Accordingly, we are exploring opportunities to establish a long-term relationship with an established CMO to develop large scale bulk vaccine production capabilities adequate to support larger trials and commercial product launch.  We believe such a relationship would also allow us to access additional manufacturing expertise and further improve our manufacturing process.
 From 2012 through December of 2017, we also contracted with Lonza Houston for the manufacture, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of our drug product. The tablets used for our clinical studies to date, including the influenza A and B phase 1 studies, the norovirus phase 1 studies, the RSV phase 1 study and the H1 influenza phase 2 challenge study, as well as all placebo for those studies, were manufactured at Lonza Houston. During 2016, we established drug product manufacturing capabilities at our corporate headquarters and all drug product has been manufactured at our facility since then. 
 Our facility is licensed by the State of California Department of Public Health Food and Drug Branch to manufacture drug product for clinical trials.
 We have limited experience with process development, and the manufacture, testing, quality release, storage and distribution of drug substance and drug product according to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and regulatory filings. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to the organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. Our facility, and our third-party manufacturers, are subject to periodic inspections by FDA and local authorities, which include, but are not limited to procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our vaccine candidates to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. If we or our third-part manufacturers fail to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements we and they could be subject to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material adverse impact on the availability of our tablet vaccine candidates. Similar to contract manufactures, we have in the past encountered difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, and if we are not able to produce drug product or drug substance in sufficient quantities are ability to conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our tablet vaccine candidates, if approved, will be impaired.
 
27
 
Research and Development
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties, such as clinical research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our clinical trials and aspects of our research and preclinical testing. These third parties provide project management and monitoring services and regulatory consulting and investigative services.
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. While we believe that our proprietary tablet vaccine candidates provide competitive advantages, we face competition from many different sources, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies, as well as public and private research institutions. Any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing products and therapies as well as new products and therapies that may become available in the future.
 There are other organizations working to improve existing therapies, vaccines or delivery methods, or to develop new vaccines, therapies or delivery methods for their selected indications. Depending on how successful these efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success of our vaccine candidates, if approved.
 We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new vaccines enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any tablet or other oral delivery vaccine candidates that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, availability of therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can obtain approval for our vaccine candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Candidate
 We believe our seasonal influenza vaccine candidate will compete directly with approved vaccines in the market, which include non-recombinant and recombinant products that are administered via injection or intranasally. The major global non-recombinant injectable vaccine competitors include Astellas Pharma Inc., Abbott Laboratories, AstraZeneca UK Limited, Baxter International Inc., Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University, Seqirus-bioCSL Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, or GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi S.A., or Sanofi, Pfizer Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda. Non-recombinant intranasal competition includes MedImmune, Inc., or MedImmune, and potentially others. Recombinant injectable competitors include Sanofi, Medicago and Novavax, Inc., or Novavax. Many other groups are developing new or improved flu vaccine or delivery methods.
Norovirus Vaccine Candidate
 There is currently no approved norovirus vaccine for sale globally. While we are not aware of all of our competitors efforts, we believe that Takeda is developing a norovirus vaccine that would be delivered by injection.
HPV Therapeutic Vaccine Candidate
 There is currently no approved HPV therapeutic vaccine for sale globally; however, a number of vaccine manufacturers, academic institutions and other organizations currently have, or have had, programs to develop such a vaccine. We believe that several companies are in various stages of developing an HPV therapeutic vaccine including Inovio, Advaxis, Genexine, and several others.

Inavir
 Other anti influenza antivirals are marketed in Japan, including Tamiflu and Relenza. On February 23, 2018, Osaka-based drug maker Shionogi & Co gained marketing approval for Xofluza, a new drug to treat influenza in Japan. The drug was approved for use against type A and B influenza viruses and requires only a single dose regardless of age. Xofluza may gain significant market share from Inavir in Japan, substantially reducing the sales of Inavir. This would significantly decrease the royalty payments we receive from Daiichi Sankyo.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the vaccine field. In addition, we rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. We also utilize trademark protection for our company name and expect to do so for products and/or services as they are marketed.
 Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our tablet vaccine candidates may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
 We have developed numerous patents and patent applications and own substantial know-how and trade secrets related to our platform and tablet vaccine candidates.
 ·      Vaccine Platform Technology. As of December 31, 2018, we hold three U.S. patents with granted claims relating to our platform technology. Two of these U.S. patents include claims related to our seasonal influenza vaccine candidate. These patents will expire in 2027, or later if patent term extension applies. As of December 31, 2018, we hold more than 50 issued foreign patents and one pending foreign patent application related to our platform technology and/or our vaccine candidates. These patents will expire in 2027, or later if patent term extension applies.
 ·      Tablet Vaccine Formulation. We own considerable know-how and hold one Singapore patent and 16 pending applications in the United States and around the world related to our tablet vaccine formulation technology. This patent and any patents issuing from these applications will expire in 2035, or later if patent term extension applies.
 ·      Influenza, Norovirus and RSV Vaccine Candidates. As of December 31, 2018, we have filed 12 applications in the United States and around the world relating to our norovirus and RSV vaccine candidates. Any patents issuing from these applications will expire in 2036, or later if patent term extension applies. We have been issued 13 foreign patents related to our current H1N1 influenza vaccine candidate. These patents will expire in 2030,or later if patent term extension applies.
 ·      Relenza. As of December 31, 2018, we own one Japanese patent related to Relenza, which is exclusively licensed to GSK. This patent will expire in July 2019. All other Relenza patents have expired.
 In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of preclinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop products based on our proprietary intellectual property.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patents term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
 The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our vaccine candidates and their methods of use.
 
Trade Secrets
 We rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these procedures, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Federal, state and local government authorities in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological and pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our vaccine candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Product Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 ·      completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
 ·      submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 ·      performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDAs regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
 ·      submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that meets applicable requirements to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the product that is the subject of the BLA based on results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
 ·      satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced, to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological products identity, strength, quality and purity;
 ·      potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
 ·      FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
 
30
 
Before testing any biological vaccine candidate, including our tablet vaccine candidates, in humans, the vaccine candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the vaccine candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsors control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDAs regulations composing the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 ·      Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in subjects.
 ·      Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
 ·      Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 31
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsors initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the products identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 
32
 
  Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
 
33
 
Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological products safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the products approved uses, known as off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
 In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a products approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDAs policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our tablet vaccine candidates under development.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and similar state laws, each as amended.
 The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The anti-kickback statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. 
 
34
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the anti-kickback statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, as discussed below.
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes any request or demand for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for knowing failures. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.
 
35
 
  In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any tablet vaccine candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our tablet vaccine candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our tablet vaccine candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payors decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payors determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any tablet vaccine candidates for which it receives regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect the pressure on healthcare pricing will continue to increase. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
36
 
US Healthcare Reform
 We anticipate that current and future U.S. legislative healthcare reforms may result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our tablet vaccine candidates. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Foreign Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
