 Item 1. Business.
Overview
Veritone, Inc. (collectively with our subsidiaries, referred to as “Veritone,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”) is a leading provider of artificial intelligence (“AI”) computing solutions and services. We are driven by the belief that AI is key to building a safer, more efficient, transparent and empowered society. Our mission is to be an active contributor to making the world better through AI. As creators of one of the world’s first AI operating systems, we are augmenting the human workforce by transforming use-case concepts into tangible, industry-leading applications and solutions.
 Our proprietary AI operating system, aiWARETM, uses machine learning algorithms, or AI models, together with a suite of powerful applications, to reveal valuable insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. aiWARE serves as the foundation for our AI solutions and bespoke applications and offers access to hundreds of cognitive engines through one common software infrastructure. Highly modular and customizable, aiWARE enables expansive scale with the flexibility to deploy in the cloud, at the edge or in hybrid environments. Our aiWARE platform offers capabilities that mimic human cognitive functions such as perception, prediction and problem solving, enabling users to quickly, efficiently and cost effectively transform unstructured data into structured data, and analyze and optimize data to drive business processes and insights. aiWARE is based on an open architecture that enables new AI models, applications and workflows to be added quickly and efficiently, resulting in a scalable and evolving solution that can be leveraged by organizations across a range of industries.
 We also offer cloud-native digital content management solutions and content licensing services, primarily to customers in the media and entertainment market. These offerings utilize aiWARE, providing customers with unique capabilities to enrich and drive expanded revenue opportunities from their content.
 In addition, we operate a full-service advertising agency that leverages aiWARE to provide differentiated managed services to our customers. Our advertising services include media planning and strategy, advertisement buying and placement, campaign messaging, clearance verification and attribution, and custom analytics, specializing in host-endorsed and influencer advertising across radio, podcasting, streaming audio, social media and other digital media channels. Our advertising services also include our VeriAds Network, which is comprised of programs that enable broadcasters, podcasters and social media influencers to generate incremental advertising revenue. In March 2022, we acquired an influencer-based management company to augment and accelerate our advertising services and capabilities.
In September 2021, we acquired PandoLogic. Ltd. (“PandoLogic”), a company incorporated under the laws of the state of Israel, which is a leading provider of intelligent hiring solutions and utilizes its proprietary platform, PandoIQ, to accelerate the time and improve efficiency for employers hiring at scale for both mass market and difficult-to-source candidates. PandoLogic’s fully autonomous recruiting platform helps employers source talent faster and more efficiently with predictive algorithms, machine learning and AI.

 The Market Opportunity
 Today, unstructured data is growing rapidly and Gartner clients are reporting 30% to 60% growth in unstructured data year over year (2022 Strategic Roadmap for Storage, March 2022). This creates significant challenges for companies and

governments across the globe, including how to create systematic solutions to address the ever-increasing volume of unstructured data. Whether it is a local police department trying to rapidly solve crimes through analysis of video evidence, a media company searching years of television archives for specific images and video content, or the U.S. military trying to analyze huge volumes of satellite and other aerial images, we believe AI is the only efficient solution to these complex challenges.
To address the ever-growing challenges surrounding unstructured data, we developed aiWARE, our proprietary AI operating system. aiWARE orchestrates AI models, together with a suite of powerful applications, to reveal valuable insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. aiWARE offers capabilities that mimic human cognitive functions such as perception, prediction, problem solving and optimization, enabling users to quickly, efficiently and cost effectively transform unstructured data into structured data, and analyze and optimize data to drive business processes and insights.
Our Solution
 aiWARE is based on an open architecture that enables new AI models, applications and workflows to be added quickly and efficiently. This results in a scalable and evolving solution that can be easily leveraged by organizations in a broad range of industries that capture or use audio, video and other unstructured data, together with structured data, such as the media and entertainment, government, legal and compliance, and other vertical markets, driving down the cost, complexity and time to develop, deploy and distribute AI-enabled applications in their operations. Our aiWARE platform is offered primarily through a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) delivery model and can be deployed in a number of environments and configurations to meet our customers’ needs.
 

Our aiWARE platform encompasses the following:
•Industry Applications. We provide numerous AI-powered applications that span local and federal government, legal and compliance, and media and entertainment verticals. These applications search and rapidly extract actionable insight from evidence, quickly locate case-critical evidence and compliance risks, and analyze, manage, and monetize media assets.


•Automate Studio and Developer APIs. Our aiWARE platform allows enterprise AI Leaders responsible for IT, MLOps, ModelOps, ML, data science, or digital transformation to quickly and easily create aiWARE-based AI workflows with a low-code designer and utilize aiWARE APIs directly to add content intelligence to existing legacy applications or build cloud-native or IoT apps. 
 •Intelligent Data Lake. Our customers can save, index and search data insights across engines with aiWARE’s intelligent data lake, which provides time-correlated cognitive metadata indexing and enables multivariate, time-based search in applications. Developers can use this time-correlated data to trigger workflows when certain events occur.
 •Applications and Cognitive Analytics. We have developed a suite of core applications and several industry targeted applications, which are discussed in more detail below, to facilitate the use of our platform and enable users to unlock actionable insights from their diverse datasets. The modular structure of aiWARE enables rapid development and deployment of applications, including ChatGPT, that are relevant to the specific needs of different markets. This allows us and third parties to build and deploy new applications on top of our aiWARE architecture or integrate existing applications with aiWARE quickly and easily.
 •Generative AI. Generative AI enables the creation of novel content from data inputs, rather than simply analyzing or acting on existing input data. Generative AI technology is currently being used across numerous industries for a variety of purposes such as simulating human conversation, producing multilingual content and ad promos and summarizing and making recommendations based on large volumes of data. With the increasing prominence of large language models, such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT, we recently introduced generative AI capabilities to aiWARE. Veritone Generative AI allows organizations to create custom, domain-specific large language models and knowledge graphs based on the data they store on aiWARE and to integrate these proprietary models with public large language models. These capabilities are available in aiWARE natively, via API as well as through Automate Studio, and we plan to integrate them with our industry-specific applications in the future. In addition to its current large language model support, we also plan to natively support expanded generative AI models for image and video generation, such as DALL-E and other prompt-to-image and video models, through aiWARE, in the second quarter of 2023.
 aiWARE is available through multiple deployment models that can be configured to meet each customer’s specific requirements. These deployment models include fully cloud-based options hosted by us in Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and Microsoft Azure (“Azure”) commercial and secure government cloud environments; on-premises options, which allow users to utilize aiWARE’s cognitive processing and certain other capabilities in their controlled environment; and hybrid cloud/on-premises options, which give users of our on-premises capabilities the option to also connect to our services in the cloud, either to provision additional services to run within their controlled environment, or to use our additional cloud-based services to process data, search and analyze the results. We currently hold an Authorization to Operate (“ATO”) under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP”) for our AWS secure government cloud platform to support government customers.
 Our current architecture gives us the flexibility to deploy many of aiWARE’s capabilities in virtually any environment, including select arm64 architectures, with improved scalability and reliability. We are continuing to enhance the portability of aiWARE to provide substantially all of the features and functionality of the platform within any environment to meet our customers’ needs.
 Markets in Which We Operate
 We serve two distinct markets: Commercial Enterprise and Government & Regulated Industries. We have developed several applications and services addressing specific customer use cases within these target markets. We intend to leverage the capabilities that we have developed for these key markets to expand into other markets in the future. We have identified numerous ways in which our aiWARE platform and related AI technology may be used to extract valuable insights from large volumes of data to address real-world problems across a broad range of markets and applications.
Commercial Enterprise
 Commercial Enterprise today consists of customers in the commercial sector, including media and entertainment, advertising, content licensing and hiring solutions customers.

 oInfluencer Bridge. Pay-per-performance advertising program that enables audio and video content creators, including podcast, Instagram and YouTube influencers, to monetize their content through CPA (cost per action) advertisements by pairing them with premium brands looking to expand their audience reach through new influencer avenues. Using aiWARE, we can analyze content of podcast episodes and YouTube videos included in the Influencer Bridge program to help identify new contextually relevant advertising opportunities for premier brands based on the subject matter presented, as well as to provide insights for brand safety and content transparency. 
 Government and Regulated Industries
 Government & Regulated Industries today consists of customers in government and regulated industries, including our state, local and federal government, legal, compliance and, to a lesser extent, energy customers. To date, a small portion of our historical revenue is generated from Government & Regulated Industries customers; however, we believe that there are excellent near and long term opportunities in Government & Regulated Industries to grow our business.
 Government & Regulated Industries markets include state and local government, legal and compliance markets, including law enforcement, legal and judicial professionals, and companies and regulatory bodies in highly regulated industries. Law enforcement and other government agencies regularly accumulate large amounts of unstructured audio and video data, including from police body cameras, police car recorders, interview room cameras, 911 audio tapes and surveillance cameras. Historically, in most cases, investigators have had to review audio and video data manually, a task that consumes huge amounts of time and delays investigations. In addition, public agencies are required to provide certain information, which may include audio and video files, in response to requests from the public. Recently, statutes in several states have broadened the scope of information required to be disclosed and have shortened the time periods in which such disclosures must be made. Reviewing video footage to identify and authenticate the appropriate footage to be disclosed, and to redact facial images and other sensitive information prior to disclosure, have historically been time-consuming and largely manual processes. Today, law enforcement and other government agencies can leverage our aiWARE platform and applications to organize, review, analyze and gain insight from their various data sources to greatly enhance their investigative workflows and to support their public disclosure requirements.
Within the legal market, our AI technologies support eDiscovery, the process of identifying, collecting and producing electronically stored information, where audio and video content analysis is playing an increasingly important role in civil litigation and criminal proceedings. Our aiWARE platform’s applications and cognitive capabilities enable users to quickly search and analyze large volumes of audio files, video files, text-based documents and other electronically stored information to identify particular words, phrases, faces, objects and voices, and to redact sensitive information prior to production, greatly increasing the speed, reducing the cost, and improving the results of discovery processes.
 Software Products & Services used by our Government & Regulated Industries customers include:
 •aiWARE Anywhere. Provides deployment options for our aiWARE platform that lets customers harness the power of AI anywhere, any time. It provides a common software infrastructure that lets customers use end-to-end, AI-powered solutions — from data ingestion to intelligent data analysis — in either general or industry-specific 


applications. aiWARE Anywhere deployment options include on-premises, in the Veritone cloud, or in a private cloud depending on our customers' needs.
•IDentify. Powerful AI-driven application designed to enable law enforcement and judicial agencies to increase the speed and efficiency of investigative workflows. IDentify allows users to upload and maintain booking and known offender databases in aiWARE and use facial recognition technology to automatically compare these databases with video and photographic evidence, such as footage from body cameras, dash cameras and CCTV surveillance cameras, to identify potential suspects for further investigation. IDentify gives agencies a powerful tool to augment their investigative workflows, saving valuable time and resources and helping them investigate cases faster. 
 •Illuminate. Provides users with an effective means of searching voluminous sets of media and electronic documents to support eDiscovery efforts, and particularly their early case assessment efforts. This application allows users to rapidly ingest, process and search large volumes of audio, video, image and text-based documents, to identify and segregate relevant evidence for further review and analysis. Illuminate’s text analytics capabilities allow users to visually explore entities, such as the persons, organizations and locations identified in the data. Once processed and reviewed through the application, users can transfer a relevant subset of media and documents to our Redact application if redaction is necessary or export it for transfer to their eDiscovery or case management platform for further processing and workflows. 
 •Redact. Enable law enforcement and judicial agencies to leverage AI to automate the redaction of faces and other sensitive information within audio, video and image-based evidence, streamlining their redaction workflows. Redact employs AI technology to automatically detect when persons appear in evidence for review and selection. Users can also define other sensitive items appearing in video evidence and choose to automatically track the defined items for redaction throughout the video or at a single time stamp. The application then systematically obscures selected portions of the data in the evidence. With Redact, agencies may expedite their review and redaction of evidence in a fraction of the amount of time spent on manual processes, freeing up valuable resources while supporting compliance efforts with respect to stringent disclosure requirements.
 •Contact. Eases the time commitment and burden of complying with racial and identity profiling stop data collection requirements in California and offers ways to gather additional insight for agency needs. Developed in close collaboration with the California State Department of Justice as well as key city law enforcement agencies, this intelligent stop data collection application may reduce officer data collection time, minimize review effort, and provide command staff faster insight for training and other constituent transparency initiatives.
 •Tracker. Monitors people as objects in video, providing insights to help assess the visual description of a person of interest in a scene, what they are doing, and who they are with, without performing facial detection or other biometric identification that would reveal a person’s identity. Tracker enables our customers to monitor multiple video recordings and feeds when dealing with occlusion within crowded areas and impacts from lighting and distance. Tracker tracks the human body and head, whether or not the head is turned or at an unidentifiable angle and can also track clothing or anything identifiable across multiple videos and feeds. Government, law enforcement, and justice organizations have used Tracker to find persons of interest from disparate video files and build an understanding of their activities and associations. This type of “digital forensics” can help investigators create a narrative around an event or an individual contained in a video capturing a crime or an object of interest to track.
 Sales and Marketing
 Software Products & Services
 We conduct sales and marketing activities related to our Software Products & Services through a combination of our direct sales force and indirect channel partners such as value-added resellers (“VARs”), distributors, system integrators, managed services providers and referral partners. Our direct sales organization is comprised of teams of business development managers, account executives and sales managers, who are supported by sales development representatives, sales engineers, solutions architects and other inside sales personnel. These sales teams are generally organized based on their specialized knowledge and expertise within each of our target markets. Our sales team collaborates closely with our product marketing, management and development teams to evaluate and develop solutions to address the needs of customers.
We have also established, and we intend to continue to expand, an indirect sales channel comprised of VARs, distributors and referral partners. We have entered into agreements with channel partners located in the United States and internationally. These agreements generally provide the channel partners with discounts below our standard prices, have terms of one year which automatically renew on an annual basis, and are generally terminable by either party for convenience following a specified notice period. Substantially all of our agreements with channel partners are nonexclusive; however, we

allow channel partners to register sales opportunities through our deal registration program, in which case we may grant a channel partner priority to pursue an opportunity for a specified period of time, subject to certain conditions.
Managed Services 
 We conduct sales and marketing activities relating to our digital content licensing Managed Services business through our direct sales representatives who identify, develop and manage our relationships with strategic Commercial Enterprise customers in the advertising, entertainment/documentary and network broadcasting industries. We maintain our commerce web portal, where stock content and select libraries can be licensed and downloaded directly, but the majority of our business is driven through high-value libraries that require an approval process to gain access. We also cross-sell additional products and services, including media management and aiWARE, to our content licensor partners.
We market and sell our advertising Managed Services through a combination of our direct sales and indirect channel sales. We primarily market and sell directly to advertisers through outbound sales networking and client and partner referrals. Our indirect sales channel consists of referral partners who are mainly advertising agencies or marketing consultants who are unable to provide certain services to their clients, such as radio, podcast and YouTube placements. In addition to our sales efforts for new clients, we further expand sales opportunities and upsell through our campaign strategists who work directly with our advertising clients to optimize and enhance media spending on advertising campaigns.
Customers
Software Products & Services
 We market and sell our Software Products & Services to customers in the Commercial Enterprise and Government & Regulated Industries markets. During 2022, ten customers accounted for approximately 76% of the total revenues from our Software Products & Services, with one customer accounting for approximately 58% of the total revenues from Software Products & Services. As we continue to grow our revenues from our Software Products & Services across our markets, we believe that our dependence on any single customer or group of customers will be reduced.
Managed Services 
 We market and sell our advertising Managed Services to customers that make significant investments in advertising, particularly in native and spot-based advertising campaigns delivered over broadcast radio, satellite audio, streaming audio, podcasting, digital video services and other social media channels. During 2022, ten advertising customers accounted for approximately 38% of the total revenues from our Managed Services, with one advertising customer accounting for approximately 11% of the total Managed Services revenues. We market and sell our content licensing Managed Services to customers such as major sports networks, advertising agencies, and film production companies that require high value content for their broadcasts and projects. During 2022, ten content licensing customers accounted for approximately 11% of the total Managed Services revenues.
 Competition
Software Products & Services
 The market for AI-enabled solutions is rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and we face competition from various sources, including large, well-capitalized technology companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Palantir. In the case of our hiring solutions, the market for talent acquisition software and services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and we face competition from programmatic job advertising software companies, traditional human capital management (HCM) companies, companies primarily focused on offering applicant tracking systems, and providers of point solutions for specific use cases such as for recruitment marketing, and these companies include, without limitation, Oracle and SAP.
Our large competitors may have better brand name recognition, greater financial and engineering resources and larger sales and marketing teams than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to develop and introduce, or acquire companies that may be able to develop and introduce, competing solutions and technologies that may have greater capabilities than ours or that are able to achieve greater customer acceptance, and they may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Some customers may also be hesitant to use a new platform and prefer to upgrade products offered by their incumbent platforms for

reasons including price, quality, sophistication, familiarity and global presence. In addition, we may compete with smaller competitors, including developers of AI models, who may develop their own solutions that perform similar services as our platform for specific use cases, as well as with systems integrators that aggregate and integrate cognitive solutions from multiple providers for their clients.
We believe the following competitive attributes are necessary for us to successfully compete in the AI industry for Commercial Enterprise and Government & Regulated Industries customers for our Software Products & Services:
•Applications to enable our platform to be effectively leveraged for a wide variety of use cases; 
 •Breadth, depth and performance of cognitive processing and other AI capabilities, particularly accuracy and speed; 
 •Availability of cloud-based and on-premises deployment models and functionality; 
 •Ease of deployment and integration; 
 •Platform scalability, reliability and security; and
 •Cost of deploying and using our products. 
 We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. We believe that few of our competitors currently compete directly with us across all of our cognitive capabilities and vertical markets, and that none of our competitors currently deploy an AI operating system with an open ecosystem comprised of a comparable number of multiple proprietary and third party AI models that can be accessed by customers from a single integrated platform.
Competitors for our Software Products & Services fall into the following primary categories:
•Infrastructure-based cloud computing vendors offering cognitive processing services via APIs, such as IBM Watson via IBM Cloud, Microsoft Cognitive Services via Azure and Amazon Machine Learning via AWS; 
 •Smaller AI-focused vendors offering solutions within a single cognitive category such as facial recognition, object recognition, natural language processing or generative AI; 
 •Enterprise services and solutions providers that combine their services with technology developed in-house to address specific challenges for organizations, such as Palantir and C3.ai;
 •System integrators that aggregate and integrate solutions from multiple underlying providers of cognitive services for clients, such as Accenture and Deloitte Consulting; and 
 •Providers of hardware and/or software solutions serving a particular market, which are incorporating into their solutions automated processing, search and/or data analytics capabilities that provide functionality similar to our industry targeted applications, including the following: 
 oIn the media and entertainment market, providers of digital asset management systems;
 oIn the public safety market, providers of police body cameras and car recorders and associated content storage and management systems; and
 oIn the legal market, providers of eDiscovery solutions and/or associated hosting and managed services.
 Managed Services
 Competitors of our advertising Managed Services are mainly traditional advertising agencies that are either large full-service agencies or smaller niche agencies with a particular specialization or focus, such as radio media placement or podcast advertising, as well as large consulting firms in the media industry. We believe that we currently, and will continue to, compete successfully against our competitors on several key factors. We are a leader in endorsed radio and podcast advertising services, and we leverage our platform to provide our customers with innovative technology that we believe provides them with better analytics and insights into their advertising campaigns than our competitors for superior advertising performance and optimization.
We do not currently face significant competition from third parties for our content licensing Managed Services, particularly in North America; however, many content owners choose to manage the licensing of their content in-house, and

content owners that we currently represent may choose to license their content directly in the future. We believe that we may face more competition in North America if new content licensing companies emerge or expand their business in the region. As we expand our content licensing services to international markets, we believe that we may face greater competition from established content licensing and talent management companies. We believe that our ability to use the cognitive capabilities of aiWARE to enrich and enhance the searchability of content, and to leverage relationships with existing customers and vendors across our Managed Services business, gives us a competitive advantage over other content licensing companies and allows us to achieve greater benefits for content owners than they can achieve through their own in-house efforts.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is comprised of employees who are responsible for the design, development and testing of our AI and software solutions, including software engineers, quality engineers, data scientists, data engineers, product managers and user experience designers. Our research and development organization is generally organized in teams, with teams focused on our core aiWARE architecture and capabilities and other teams focused on solutions and applications that address specific use cases in our key markets. We focus our efforts on developing new features and expanding the core technologies that further enhance the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of aiWARE, as well as allow us to operate in new vertical markets. In addition, we contract with select third-party engineering services to support development and quality assurance testing. We plan to continue to make significant investments in developing our AI technologies, expanding the functionality and capabilities of aiWARE and related solutions, and building new software capabilities.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand.
As of March 10, 2023, in the United States, we have 41 issued patents, which expire between 2030 and 2042, and have 12 patent applications pending for examination. As of such date, we also had 13 issued patents and 41 patent applications pending for examination in foreign jurisdictions (including international PCT applications), all of which are based on counterpart U.S. patent applications pursued by us. In addition, we have registered, or have applied for registration of, numerous trademarks, including Veritone and aiWARE, in the United States and in several foreign jurisdictions. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.
Seasonality
 We experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenue and operating performance as a result of the utilization of our platform and associated revenues from our Software Products & Services. In particular, our hiring solutions revenues have historically been higher in the second half of each fiscal year, consistent with the hiring cycles of our larger customers. We also experience seasonality a result of factors such as the timing of large projects, the length and complexity of our sales cycles, trends impacting our target vertical markets and our revenue recognition policies and any changes we make to those policies. Within a given quarter, a higher proportion of our agreements are signed toward the end of such quarter. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance.
 Regulatory Environment
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including within Israel and parts of Europe, that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection and other subjects.
Our customers utilize our products and services to process, analyze and store data in a manner which may cause us to carry out certain processing of personal information that is subject to data protection and privacy laws in various jurisdictions including the European Union and United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) laws regulating the use of AI, automated decision making, machine learning, and biometric technologies (including facial recognition), and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, including states and

localities within the United States. Under these data protection and privacy laws, we are required to maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security and protection of personal data and information, and we must comply (either directly or indirectly pursuant to requirements of our contracts with customers) with a number of requirements with respect to individuals whose personal data or information we collect and process, including, among others, notification requirements and requirements to comply with requests from individuals to (i) opt out of collection, processing and/or sale of their data or information, (ii) delete their data or information, and (iii) receive copies of and other information regarding our collection and processing of their data or information.
 The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) amends and expands the CCPA to include additional obligations of businesses with respect to collecting, processing and sharing personal information and responding to requests from consumers related to their personal information. Additionally, the CPRA applies to personal information of business representatives and employees. We are obligated to comply with the CPRA and the regulations to be implemented thereunder. Moreover, governments, regulators and individuals are increasingly scrutinizing the use of AI and machine learning technologies (including the associated processing of personal data), automated decision making (including in an employment and/or recruitment context), and the processing of biometric data (including through facial recognition technologies). Numerous laws and regulations around the world have been enacted or proposed to regulate these areas, and several lawsuits have been filed, particularly in the United States, challenging the processing of biometric data, which may reduce our customers’ demand for our products.
Human Capital Resources
 As of March 10, 2023, we had a total of 661 employees, substantially all of whom were full-time employees. 217 of our U.S-based employees are located in California, with another 323 employees located in 40 other states. We also have 104 employees located in Israel, 14 in the United Kingdom, 1 in Singapore, 1 in Austria and 1 in the Netherlands.
We believe that our employees are our greatest asset and our company culture is a critical component of our success. We strive to create a diverse and inclusive work environment in which all employees feel a strong sense of community and embody our core values. 41% of our employees are women, and 18% of our employees are members of ethnic or racial minorities and other legally protected classes. We have implemented a number of initiatives to ensure that our employees are engaged and motivated to work hard and have fun at the same time. We conduct employee engagement surveys to gauge employee satisfaction, identify areas for improvement and implement positive change to evolve and better our company culture.
 We strive to hire, develop and retain the top talent in the industry. To attract top talent, we offer competitive salaries, incentives, equity compensation and benefits.
