ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Daré” or the “Company” refer collectively to Daré Bioscience, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires. All information in this report is based on our fiscal year. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to our fiscal years ending December 31 and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the advancement of innovative products for women’s health. We are driven by a mission to identify, develop and bring to market a diverse portfolio of differentiated therapies that expand treatment options, improve outcomes and facilitate convenience for women, primarily in the areas of contraception, vaginal health, sexual health and fertility.
Our Strategy
Our business strategy is to license or otherwise acquire the rights to differentiated product candidates in women's health, some of which have existing clinical proof-of-concept data, and to advance those candidates through clinical development and regulatory approval on our own or in collaboration with strategic partners.
We believe that there is an opportunity to fill the gap that exists in the development of innovations in women’s health between (a) non-profit organizations, small private companies and individual entrepreneurs that discover, innovate and conduct early-stage research and clinical development of product candidates, and (b) pharmaceutical companies that conduct late-stage clinical development and commercialize approved products. We believe that the development activities between these two ends of this spectrum (early pre-clinical and clinical development of product candidates on the one hand and late-stage clinical trials and commercialization of product candidates on the other) are currently underserved. In addition, we believe there are gaps in treatment options in the women's health market and there is an opportunity to provide therapies that address persistent unmet needs. We intend to fill the mid-stage development gap and to address the gaps in treatment options for women.
 The dynamics of the women’s health market provide an opportunity for us to assemble a portfolio of candidates, including clinical-stage candidates, often with published human data. We have licensed or otherwise acquired four clinical-stage product candidates as well as a number of pre-clinical product candidates. While we will continue to assess opportunities to expand our portfolio, our current focus is on advancing our existing product candidates through late stages of development or approval. If successful, we intend to create a comprehensive global commercialization strategy with established pharmaceutical partners and regional distributors. Our global commercialization and development strategy includes partnering with pharmaceutical companies and regional distributors once we have advanced a candidate through mid-stage to late-stage development, including but not limited to entering into co-development and promotion agreements.
Our Clinical-Stage Product Candidates and Programs
We are initially focused on the areas of contraception, vaginal health, sexual health and fertility. We have focused primarily on adding product candidates to our portfolio with pre-clinical and early clinical testing data developed by third parties. Our development strategy is two-fold:

(1) | We intend to use existing data and any data we generate to prepare Investigational New Drug Applications, or INDs, or Investigational Device Exemptions, or IDEs, to the extent these have not already been prepared, and to design and implement additional pre-clinical and clinical trials to advance our programs toward the submission of New Drug Applications, or NDAs, or Premarket Approvals, or PMAs, for regulatory approval of our product candidates.


(2) | We intend to identify FDA-approved drugs and therapies that might benefit from a different formulation, manner of application or delivery method to enhance therapeutic outcomes and to expedite the development of these candidates under the FDA's 505(b)(2) pathway. We intend to utilize the FDA's 505(b)(2) pathway for three of our four existing clinical-stage candidates.

We believe our product candidates offer innovative therapeutic approaches that may provide meaningful benefits over current treatment options. We are currently developing four clinical-stage product candidates: 

• | DARE-BV1, a unique hydrogel formulation of clindamycin phosphate 2% to treat bacterial vaginosis;

3


• | Ovaprene®, a non-hormonal monthly contraceptive intravaginal ring;


• | Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, a novel cream formulation of sildenafil to treat female sexual arousal disorder; and


• | DARE-HRT1, a combination bio-identical estradiol and progesterone intravaginal ring for hormone replacement therapy following menopause.

DARE-BV1
In December 2018, we announced that we entered into agreements with Hammock Pharmaceuticals, Inc., TriLogic Pharma, LLC and MilanaPharm LLC, through which we acquired the exclusive global development and commercialization rights to a proprietary hydrogel drug delivery technology formulated with clindamycin, or DARE-BV1 (formerly known as MP-101), for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, or BV, as well as similar rights to utilize the underlying proprietary hydrogel drug delivery technology for any vaginal or urological applications in humans. The proprietary in-situ gel system we licensed is designed to undergo transition from a viscous liquid to a bioadhesive gel, or solution-to-gel (sol-to-gel) transition, at the site of application using body temperature as the trigger, and release the incorporated active drug over multiple days, enabling single treatment products. In DARE-BV1, this proprietary technology is formulated with clindamycin, an antibiotic used to treat certain bacterial infections including BV, and is designed to produce a dual release pattern after vaginal application (an initial burst with approximately 50% of the active ingredient released in three days, followed by a slow release of the second 50% over the following four days), providing prolonged duration of exposure to clindamycin at the site of infection. 
BV is a type of vaginal inflammation caused by the overgrowth of certain bacteria naturally found in the vagina. Symptoms include vaginal discharge, vaginal odor, vaginal pain, itching or burning, and burning during urination. We believe current BV therapies are inadequate and there is a significant unmet need for better treatment. Existing FDA-approved therapies have clinical cure rates (based on Amsel’s Diagnostic Criteria) of less than 70%. In an investigator initiated pilot study that enrolled 30 women between the age of 18 to 50, DARE-BV1 demonstrated an 88% clinical cure rate in the evaluable subjects (n=26) at the test-of-cure visit (Day 7-14) after one vaginal administration.
Because BV is a vaginal ailment, many women and providers prefer a treatment administered directly to the infection site over treatments taken orally. This is particularly true for antibiotics given the potential unwanted side effects accompanying oral systemic administration. Given the unique environment of the vagina, we believe one of the major challenges is keeping a vaginally-administered drug or therapeutic agent in place long enough to treat the infection. Our novel hydrogel formulation is designed for extended release (up to seven days) of the active ingredient, clindamycin phosphate 2%, at the site of infection. We believe our hydrogel’s unique adhesion properties and release profile led to the encouraging cure rates in the initial pilot study.
We intend to file a new IND during the second half of 2019 and to commence a Phase 3 clinical study of DARE-BV1 in approximately 250 women in the fourth quarter of 2019. If the study is successful, we plan to be in a position to file an NDA with the FDA in 2020. Based on discussions between the prior sponsor, MilanaPharm, and the FDA, we believe that one successful Phase 3 study, with sufficient power and size, would be sufficient for FDA approval of DARE-BV1 to treat BV. We plan to leverage the existing data and established safety profile of other products using clindamycin phosphate to utilize the FDA’s 505(b)(2) pathway for approval of DARE-BV1 for treatment of BV in the U.S. We anticipate that the cost for the Phase 3 clinical study, including manufacturing activities, and the NDA filing thereafter to be less than $10.0 million.
Ovaprene
We believe the need for more effective and convenient options is particularly true with contraception. While a variety of hormonal and non-hormonal options exist, there is a notable void: an effective, short-acting, non-hormonal method of contraception that does not require intervention at the time of intercourse.
Ovaprene is designed to provide monthly, hormone-free, convenient (inserted by the woman and worn for multiple weeks) contraceptive protection with “typical use” effectiveness comparable to the most effective barrier option (the diaphragm) and short-acting hormonal options (pill, patches and vaginal ring). Ovaprene is a silicone-reinforced ring with a soft, absorbable scaffolding that encircles a fluid-permeable barrier. A non-braided, multi-filament mesh in the center of the ring functions as a physical barrier to sperm. The silicone ring also releases two ingredients-ascorbic acid and ferrous gluconate-that act together to create a spermiostatic environment within the vagina. If approved, Ovaprene would represent a new category of birth control. 
4

In a postcoital test, or PCT, pilot study conducted in 20 women and published in The Journal of Reproductive Medicine® in 2009, Ovaprene demonstrated the ability to immobilize sperm and prevent their progression into the cervical mucus. The study also demonstrated the acceptability of the device to both partners. No colposcopic abnormalities, no significant changes in vaginal flora and no serious adverse effects were observed.
Ovaprene is a combination product that underwent a request for designation process within the Office of Combination Products at the FDA. The FDA designated Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, as the lead agency FDA program center for premarket review and product regulation. It also provided notice that CDRH determined that a PMA will be required to market Ovaprene in the U.S. 
Our clinical development plan for Ovaprene is guided by the size, structure and results of other barrier contraceptive devices using active agents that obtained FDA approval with CDRH as lead review division because we believe they provide a good indication of the FDA requirements for Ovaprene. Specifically, in addition to demonstrating biocompatibility and safety, we expect the clinical requirements for FDA approval for Ovaprene will include obtaining safety and preliminary efficacy data in a PCT clinical trial, and conducting one large, single-arm safety and efficacy study, the pivotal clinical trial. We have not yet had communications with the FDA regarding the specific PMA requirements for Ovaprene and hence, the requirements for approval may be more extensive and costlier than we currently anticipate.
In May 2018, we announced the initiation of a PCT clinical trial of Ovaprene, which is being conducted in collaboration with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03598088). The study is designed to assess general safety, acceptability, and effectiveness in preventing progressively motile sperm from reaching the cervical canal following intercourse and will enroll approximately 50 couples with a target of having at least 25 women complete a total of 21 visits. Each woman’s cervical mucus will be measured at several points during the study. Women will be evaluated over the course of five menstrual cycles, including a baseline measurement excluding the use of any product (during menstrual cycle 1), using a diaphragm (during menstrual cycle 2) and using Ovaprene (during menstrual cycles 3, 4 and 5). 
If our ongoing PCT clinical trial demonstrates that Ovaprene is effective in preventing most sperm from progressing into the cervical canal and is safe to use over multiple weeks, we intend to prepare and file an IDE with the FDA to commence a pivotal clinical trial of similar size and duration as the Caya® diaphragm pivotal study, which evaluated pregnancy rates in approximately 250 women over a period of six months. Prior to completing our U.S. pivotal study of Ovaprene, we may seek a Conformite Europeenne, or CE, Mark approval for Europe using a subset of the total pivotal clinical trial population. We believe that the receipt of E.U. or U.S. regulatory approvals can be used to support registration in many other countries around the world.
Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%
Today, there are no FDA-approved products that specifically address the symptoms or underlying pathology of female sexual arousal disorder, or FSAD. Although numerous pharmaceutical products have been developed and approved to treat erectile dysfunction in men, women continue to lack effective options for FSAD, an analogous condition. In February 2018, we announced that we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, as a potential treatment for FSAD. 
FSAD is characterized primarily by a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain sufficient physical sexual arousal, frequently resulting in distress or interpersonal difficulty. Orally administered sildenafil received FDA approval in 1998 for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men and is marketed under the brand name Viagra®. Oral sildenafil also demonstrated biological activity when studied in women, but due to differences between male and female physiology, it is expected that a topically administered formulation of sildenafil (applied directly to the genital region) may have advantages over the oral formulation. Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% is a unique, proprietary topical formulation of sildenafil specially formulated for women and designed to be applied directly to the genital tissue. Based on known biological pathways for the molecule, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% is expected to increase local blood flow to the genital tissue, which we believe will lead to an improvement in genital response and overall sexual experience. 
In a Phase 1 clinical study of three escalating doses of topical sildenafil cream (1 g cream with 35 mg sildenafil; 2 g cream with 71 mg sildenafil; and 4 g cream with 142 mg sildenafil) in 20 healthy post-menopausal women using a crossover study design, topical sildenafil demonstrated significantly lower systemic exposure compared to a 50 mg oral sildenafil dose, and topical sildenafil was safe and well tolerated at clinically relevant doses (1-2 g cream). Study subjects reported favorable product characteristics: easy to use and readily absorbed.
In a Phase 2a, single center, single-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover study in 31 women with FSAD (15 pre-menopausal and 16 post-menopausal), topical sildenafil cream demonstrated increases in 
5

measurable blood flow to the genital tissue compared to placebo (mean change in vaginal pulse amplitude, or VPA, analysis) using a vaginal photoplethysmograph approximately 30 minutes post-dosing. VPA uses light technology to indicate changes in vaginal engorgement, wherein higher amplitudes indicate higher levels of blood flow. 
In the third quarter of 2018, we had a Type C meeting with the FDA regarding the proposed design of our Phase 2b clinical trial for Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% and the overall development program for this product candidate. Based on the guidance we received from that meeting with the FDA, we commenced Phase 2b related activities during the fourth quarter of 2018 with the initiation of a non-interventional study intended to support the validity of specific patient reported outcome, or PRO, measures to assess efficacy of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%. This non-interventional study is designed to explore the experience of FSAD and to evaluate the relevance of the selected PRO measures based on patients’ own experiences and determine patients’ understanding of the items, instructions, and response options of the selected PRO measures. With this study we seek to identify and document the genital arousal symptoms that will be assessed in our planned at-home Phase 2b trial and in our pivotal studies, and to demonstrate that these symptoms are the most important and relevant to our target population and should be acceptable endpoints for the FDA. In parallel, we will continue to explore additional clinical and non-clinical work that might be valuable or required to support the overall program and the anticipated design of the Phase 2b trial. Because our plan is for the co-primary endpoints used in the Phase 2b trial to reflect the endpoints used in the Phase 3 trials, after the ongoing qualitative study is completed and before the Phase 2b at-home trial is initiated, we plan to request another Type C meeting to obtain the FDA’s guidance on endpoints for our Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials, including whether the FDA agrees that our proposed PRO instruments are content valid for the target population. The timing of when we initiate the Phase 2b at-home trial will be influenced by such guidance.
We plan to leverage the existing data on sildenafil and the established safety profile of the Viagra® brand to pursue the FDA’s 505(b)(2) pathway for approval of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% in the U.S. If approved, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% could be the first FDA-approved FSAD treatment option for women.
DARE-HRT1
 In April 2018, we announced that we entered into an exclusive, global license with Juniper Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Juniper, for its novel intravaginal ring, or IVR, technology. Our license covers all rings that were in development by Juniper, as well as additional applications of the IVR technology platform in other therapeutic areas. Unlike other vaginal rings, this IVR technology is designed to release drugs via a solid ethylene vinyl acetate polymer matrix without the need for a membrane or reservoir to contain the active drug or control the release, allowing for sustained drug delivery over time periods ranging from weeks to months.
DARE-HRT1 (formerly known as JNP-0201) is the first product candidate based on Juniper’s IVR technology that we are advancing into clinical development. DARE-HRT1 is a unique IVR that combines bio-identical estradiol and progesterone to treat vasomotor symptoms (VMS) associated with menopause as part of a hormone replacement therapy regimen. Hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, is considered the most effective treatment for VMS and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture.
In 2019, we plan to conduct a Phase 1 open-label, three-arm, parallel group study in approximately 30 healthy post-menopausal women to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, or PK, and safety of DARE-HRT1. The primary objectives of the proposed study are to describe the PK parameters of two different dose combinations (estradiol 80 µg/progesterone 4 mg IVR and estradiol 160 µg/progesterone 8 mg IVR) over 28 days, and to identify the steady state PK of each dose combination after 28 days. We expect to report topline results of this clinical study in 2020. 
We plan to leverage the existing data and established safety profile of the active ingredients in DARE-HRT1, estradiol and progesterone, to utilize the FDA’s 505(b)(2) pathway for approval of DARE-HRT1 as hormone replacement therapy following menopause in the U.S. 
Sales and Marketing
We currently have no formal internal marketing or sales infrastructure or capabilities. If and when our product candidates are approved, we expect to enter into agreements with companies with established marketing and sales capabilities in women's health in order to supplement our internal marketing or sales efforts.
Manufacturing
We rely on third parties to manufacture our clinical trial materials and supplies and, if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we expect to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of our products.

License Agreements
ADVA-Tec License Agreement
In March 2017, we entered into a license agreement, or the ADVA-Tec License Agreement, with ADVA-Tec, Inc. under which we were granted an exclusive license under ADVA-Tec’s intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize Ovaprene for human contraceptive use worldwide. ADVA-Tec and its affiliates own issued patents or patent applications covering Ovaprene, and control proprietary trade secrets covering the manufacture of Ovaprene. As of March 29, 2019, this patent portfolio includes nine issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application, and 59 granted patents and four pending patent applications in other major markets, all of which are exclusively licensed to us for all uses of Ovaprene as a human contraceptive device. Under the ADVA-Tec License Agreement, we have a right of first refusal to license these patents and patent applications for additional indications. 
The following is a summary of other terms of the ADVA-Tec License Agreement: 
Research and Development. ADVA-Tec will conduct certain research and development work as necessary to allow us to seek a PMA from the FDA and will provide us with clinical supplies of Ovaprene for clinical and commercial use on commercially reasonable terms. We must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize Ovaprene, and must meet certain minimum spending amounts per year, and $5 million in the aggregate over the first three years, to cover such activities until a final PMA is filed, or until the first commercial sale of Ovaprene, whichever occurs first.
Milestone and Royalty Payments. We will pay to ADVA-Tec: (1) up to $14.6 million in the aggregate based on the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones; and (2) up to $20 million in the aggregate based on the achievement of certain worldwide net sales milestones. The development and regulatory milestones include: the completion of a successful postcoital clinical study, which is required before we can commence a Phase 3 pivotal human clinical trial; the FDA’s approval to commence a Phase 3 pivotal human clinical trial; successful completion of such Phase 3 pivotal human clinical trial; the FDA’s acceptance of a PMA filing for Ovaprene; the FDA’s approval of the PMA for Ovaprene; CE Marking of Ovaprene in at least three designated European countries; obtaining regulatory approval in at least three designated European countries; and obtaining regulatory approval in Japan. Because these milestone payments depend upon the successful progress of our product development programs, we cannot estimate with certainty when these payments will occur, if ever.
Royalty Payments. After the commercial launch of Ovaprene, we will pay to ADVA-Tec royalties based on aggregate annual net sales of Ovaprene in specified regions at a royalty rate that will vary between 1% and 10% and will increase based on various net sales thresholds.

Unless earlier terminated, the license we received under the ADVA-Tec License Agreement continues on a country-by-country basis until the later of the life of the licensed patents or our last commercial sale of Ovaprene. In addition to customary termination rights for both parties: (A) we may terminate the agreement with or without cause in whole or on a country-by-country basis upon 60 days prior written notice; and (B) ADVA-Tec may terminate the agreement if we develop or commercialize any non-hormonal ring-based vaginal contraceptive device competitive to Ovaprene or if we fail to: (1) in certain limited circumstances, commercialize Ovaprene in certain designated countries within three years of the first commercial sale of Ovaprene; (2) satisfy the annual spending obligation described above, (3) use commercially reasonable efforts to complete all necessary pre-clinical and clinical studies required to support and submit a PMA, (4) conduct clinical trials as set forth in the development plan to which we and ADVA-Tec agree, and as may be modified by a joint research committee, unless such failure is caused by events outside of our reasonable control, or (5) enroll a patient in the first non-significant risk medical device study or clinical trial as allowed by an institutional review board within six months of the production and release of Ovaprene, unless such failure is caused by events outside of the our reasonable control.
SST License and Collaboration Agreement
In February 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the SST License Agreement, with Strategic Science and Technologies-D, LLC and Strategic Science Technologies, LLC, referred to collectively as SST. The SST License Agreement provides us with an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to develop and commercialize, in all countries and geographic territories of the world, for all indications for women related to female sexual dysfunction and/or female reproductive health, including treatment of female sexual arousal disorder, or the Field of Use, SST's topical formulation of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% as it exists as of the effective date of the SST License Agreement, or any other topically applied pharmaceutical product containing sildenafil or a salt thereof as a 
7

pharmaceutically active ingredient, alone or with other active ingredients, but specifically excluding any product containing ibuprofen or any salt derivative of ibuprofen, or the Licensed Products. 
The following is a summary of other terms of the SST License Agreement:
Invention Ownership. We retain rights to inventions made by our employees, SST retains rights to inventions made by its employees, and each party owns a 50% undivided interest in all joint inventions. 
Joint Development Committee. The parties will collaborate through a joint development committee that will determine the strategic objectives for, and generally oversee, the development efforts of both parties under the SST License Agreement. 
Development. We must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the Licensed Products in the Field of Use in accordance with a development plan in the SST License Agreement, and to commercialize the Licensed Products in the Field of Use. We are responsible for all reasonable internal and external costs and expenses incurred by SST in its performance of the development activities it must perform under the SST License Agreement. 
Royalty Payments. SST will be eligible to receive tiered royalties based on percentages of annual net sales of Licensed Products in the single digits to the mid double digits, subject to customary royalty reductions and offsets, and a percentage of sublicense revenue.
Milestone Payments. SST will be eligible to receive payments (1) ranging from $0.5 million to $18.0 million in the aggregate upon achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones in the U.S. and worldwide, and (2) between $10.0 million to $100 million in the aggregate upon achieving certain commercial sales milestones. If we enter into strategic development or distribution partnerships related to the Licensed Products, additional milestone payments would be due to SST.
License Term. Our license under the SST License Agreement continues on a country-by-country basis until the later of 10 years from the date of the first commercial sale of such Licensed Product or the expiration of the last valid claim of patent rights covering the Licensed Product in the Field of Use. Upon expiration (but not termination) of the SST License Agreement in a particular country, we will have a fully paid-up license under the licensed intellectual property to develop and commercialize the applicable Licensed Products in the applicable country on a non-exclusive basis.
Termination. In addition to customary termination rights for both parties: (1) prior to receipt of approval by a regulatory authority necessary for commercialization of a Licensed Product in the corresponding jurisdiction, including NDA approval, we may terminate the SST License Agreement without cause upon 90 days prior written notice; (2) following receipt of approval by a regulatory authority necessary for commercialization of a Licensed Product in the corresponding jurisdiction, including NDA approval, we may terminate the SST License Agreement without cause upon 180 days prior written notice; and (3) SST may terminate the SST License Agreement with respect to the applicable Licensed Product(s) in the applicable country(ies) upon 30 days’ notice if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform development activities in substantial accordance with the development plan and do not cure such failure within 60 days of receipt of SST's notice thereof.
Orbis Development and Option Agreement
In March 2018, we entered into an exclusive development and option agreement, or the Orbis Agreement, with Orbis Biosciences for the development of long-acting injectable etonogestrel contraceptive with 6- and 12-month durations (ORB-204 and ORB-214, respectively). Under the Orbis Agreement, we paid Orbis $300,000 to conduct the first stage of development work, Stage 1, as follows: $150,000 upon signing the Orbis Agreement, $75,000 at the 50% completion point, not later than 6 months following the date the Orbis Agreement was signed (which we paid in September 2018), and $75,000 upon delivery by Orbis of the 6-month batch, not later than 11 months following the date the Orbis Agreement was signed (which we paid in January 2019). Upon Orbis successfully completing Stage 1 of the development program and achieving the predetermined target milestones for Stage 1, we will have 90 days to instruct Orbis whether to commence the second stage of development work, Stage 2. Should we execute our option to proceed to Stage 2, we will provide additional funding to Orbis for such activities.
Pre-clinical studies for the 6- and 12-month formulations have been completed, including establishing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles. The collaboration with Orbis will continue to advance the program through formulation optimization with the goal of achieving sustained release over the target time period.

The Orbis Agreement provides us with an option to enter into a license agreement for ORB-204 and ORB-214 should development efforts be successful.
Juniper Pharmaceuticals License Agreement
In April 2018, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement, or the Juniper License Agreement, with Juniper Pharmaceuticals, Inc., under which Juniper granted us (a) an exclusive, royalty-bearing worldwide license under certain patent rights, either owned by or exclusively licensed to Juniper, to make, have made, use, have used, sell, have sold, import and have imported products and processes; and (b) a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing worldwide license to use certain technological information owned by Juniper to make, have made, use, have used, sell, have sold, import and have imported products and processes. We are entitled to sublicense the rights granted to it under the Juniper License Agreement.
The following is a summary of other terms of the Juniper License Agreement:
Upfront Fee. We paid a $250,000 non-creditable upfront license fee to Juniper in connection with the execution of the Juniper License Agreement.
Annual Maintenance Fee. We will pay an annual license maintenance fee to Juniper on each anniversary of the date of the Juniper License Agreement, the amount of which will be $50,000 for the first two years and $100,000 thereafter, and which will be creditable against royalties and other payments due to Juniper in the same calendar year but may not be carried forward to any other year.
Milestone Payments. We must make potential future development and sales milestone payments of (1) up to $13.5 million in the aggregate upon achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones, and (2) up to $30.3 million in the aggregate upon achieving certain commercial sales milestones for each product or process covered by the licenses granted under the Juniper License Agreement.
Royalty Payments. During the royalty term, we will pay Juniper mid-single-digit to low double-digit royalties based on worldwide net sales of products and processes covered by the licenses granted under the Juniper License Agreement. In lieu of such royalty payments, we will pay Juniper a low double-digit percentage of all sublicense income we receive for the sublicense of rights under the Juniper License Agreement to a third party. The royalty term, which is determined on a country-by-country basis and product-by-product basis (or process-by-process basis), begins with the first commercial sale of a product or process in a country and terminates on the latest of (1) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights with respect to such product or process in such country, (2) 10 years following the first commercial sale of such product or process in such country, and (3) when one or more generic products for such product or process are commercially available in such country, except that if there is no such generic product by the 10th year following the first commercial sale in such country, then the royalty term will terminate on the 10-year anniversary of the first commercial sale in such country.
Efforts. We must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and make at least one product or process available to the public, which efforts include achieving specific diligence requirements by specific dates specified in the Juniper License Agreement.
Term. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the Juniper License Agreement will continue on a country-by-country basis until the later of (1) the expiration date of the last valid claim within such country, or (2) 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of a product or process in such country. Upon expiration (but not early termination) of the Juniper License Agreement, the licenses granted thereunder will convert automatically to fully-paid irrevocable licenses. Juniper may terminate the Juniper License Agreement (1) upon 30 days’ notice for our uncured breach of any payment obligation under the Juniper License Agreement, (2) if we fail to maintain required insurance, (3) immediately upon our insolvency or the making of an assignment for the benefit of our creditors or if a bankruptcy petition is filed for or against us, which petition is not dismissed within 90 days, or (4) upon 60 days’ notice for any uncured material breach by us of any of our other obligations under the Juniper License Agreement. We may terminate the Juniper License Agreement on a country-by-country basis for any reason by giving 180 days’ notice (or 90 days’ notice if such termination occurs prior to receipt of marketing approval in the United States). If Juniper terminates the Juniper License Agreement for the reason described in clause (4) above or if we terminate the Juniper License Agreement, Juniper will have full access including the right to use and reference all product data generated during the term of the Juniper License Agreement that is owned by us.

Hammock/MilanaPharm Assignment and License Agreement
On December 5, 2018, we entered into (a) an Assignment Agreement with Hammock Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or the Assignment Agreement, and (b) a First Amendment to License Agreement with TriLogic Pharma, LLC and MilanaPharm LLC, or the License Amendment. Both agreements relate to the Exclusive License Agreement among Hammock, TriLogic and MilanaPharm dated as of January 9, 2017, or the MilanaPharm License Agreement. Under the Assignment Agreement and the MilanaPharm License Agreement, as amended by the License Amendment, we acquired an exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property to, among other things, develop and commercialize products for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of human diseases or conditions in or through any intravaginal or urological applications. The licensed intellectual property relates to the hydrogel drug delivery platform of TriLogic and MilanaPharm known as TRI-726. In DARE-BV1, this proprietary technology is formulated with clindamycin, an antibiotic used to treat certain bacterial infections including BV, and has been engineered to produce a dual release pattern after vaginal application, providing maximum duration of exposure to clindamycin at the site of infection.
The following is a summary of other terms of the License Amendment:
License Fees. We paid $25,000 to MilanaPharm in connection with the execution of the License Amendment and must pay $200,000 to MilanaPharm (in our discretion, either in cash or with shares of our common stock) within 15 days of the first to occur of December 5, 2019 or the closing of an equity financing in which we raise aggregate proceeds of at least $10 million.
Milestone Payments. We will pay to MilanaPharm: (1) up to $300,000 in the aggregate upon achievement of certain clinical and regulatory development milestones; and (2) up to $1.75 million in the aggregate upon achieving certain commercial sales milestones. 
Foreign Sublicense Income. We will pay MilanaPharm a low double-digit percentage of all income received by us or our affiliates in connection with any sublicense granted to a third party for use outside of the United States, subject to certain exclusions.
Royalty Payments. During the royalty term, we will pay MilanaPharm high single-digit to low double-digit royalties based on annual worldwide net sales of licensed products and processes. The royalty term, which is determined on a country-by-country basis and licensed product-by-product basis (or process-by-process basis), begins with the first commercial sale of a licensed product or process in a country and terminates on the latest of (1) the expiration date of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights that cover the method of use of such product or process in such country, or (2) 10 years following the first commercial sale of such product or process in such country. Royalty payments are subject to reduction in certain circumstances, including as a result of generic competition, patent prosecution expenses incurred by us, or payments to third parties for rights or know-how required for us to exercise the licenses granted to it under the MilanaPharm License Agreement or that are strategically important or could add value to a licensed product or process in a manner expected to materially generate or increase sales.
Efforts. We must use commercially reasonable efforts and resources to (1) develop and commercialize at least one licensed product or process in the United States and at least one licensed product or process in at least one of Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy or Spain, and (2) continue to commercialize that product or process following the first commercial sale of a licensed product or process in the applicable jurisdiction.
Term. Unless earlier terminated, the license term continues until (1) on a licensed product-by-product (or process-by-process basis) and country-by-country basis, the date of expiration of the royalty term with respect to such licensed product in such country, and (2) the expiration of all applicable royalty terms under the MilanaPharm License Agreement with respect to all licensed products and processes in all countries. Upon expiration of the term with respect to any licensed product or process in a country (but not upon earlier termination of the MilanaPharm License Agreement), the licenses granted to us under the MilanaPharm License Agreement will convert automatically to an exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, non-terminable and irrevocable right and license under the licensed intellectual property. 
In addition to customary termination rights for all parties, MilanaPharm may terminate the license granted to us solely with respect to a licensed product or process in a country if, after having launched such product or process in such country, (1) we or our affiliates or sublicensees discontinue the sale of such product or process in such country and MilanaPharm notifies us of such termination within 60 days of having first been notified by us of such discontinuation, or (2) we or our affiliates or sublicensees (A) discontinue all commercially reasonable marketing efforts to sell, and discontinue all sales of, such product or process in such country for nine months or more, (B) fail to resume such commercially reasonable marketing efforts within 120 days of having been notified of such failure by MilanaPharm, (C) 
10

fail to reasonably demonstrate a strategic justification for the discontinuation and failure to resume to MilanaPharm, and (D) MilanaPharm gives 90 days’ notice to us.
The following is a summary of other terms of the Assignment Agreement:
Assignment; Technology Transfer. Hammock assigned and transferred to us all of its right, title and interest in and to the MilanaPharm License Agreement and agreed to cooperate to transfer to us all of the data, materials and the licensed technology in its possession pursuant to a technology transfer plan to be agreed upon by the parties, with a goal for us to independently practice the licensed intellectual property as soon as commercially practical in order to develop and commercialize the licensed products and processes. 
Fees. We paid $250,000 to Hammock in connection with the execution of the Assignment Agreement and must pay $250,000 to Hammock (in our discretion, either in cash or with shares of our common stock) within 15 days of the first to occur of December 5, 2019 or the closing of an equity financing in which we raise aggregate proceeds of at least $10 million. 
Milestone Payments. We will pay Hammock up to $1.1 million in the aggregate upon achievement of certain clinical and regulatory development milestones.
Term. The Assignment Agreement will terminate upon the later of (1) completion of the parties’ technology transfer plan, and (2) payment to Hammock of the last of the payments described above, including the milestone payments.
Intellectual Property
We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business in the United States and other jurisdictions internationally. We also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information. 
Patents
The medical device and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim relating to infringement of third party patents that is successfully asserted against us or our licensors may require us to pay substantial damages or may limit our or our licensors' ability to rely on such patent protection. Any third party claim successfully alleging the invalidity or unenforceability of the patents may also limit our or our licensors' ability to rely on such patent protection. Even if we, or our licensors were to prevail in any such action, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from our business operations. Also, if our product candidates or any future products are found to infringe the patents of others, our development, manufacture, and sale of these potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited. In addition, there can be no assurance that any patent applications filed by us or our licensors will result in the grant of a patent either in the United States or elsewhere, or that any patents granted will be valid and enforceable, or that any patents will provide a competitive advantage or afford protection against competitors with similar technologies. Because of the importance of the patents underlying our product candidates, our business and our prospects may be harmed if we fail to maintain existing or obtain new patent rights or if we and our licensors fail to protect key intellectual property rights.
Under the terms of the ADVA-Tec License Agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of nine granted U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application, and 59 granted patents and four pending patent applications in other major markets. Three of the patents that are particularly important to the protection of Ovaprene have terms until August 2028. 
Under the terms of the SST license Agreement, we are the exclusive licensee in the Field of Use of sixteen issued patents worldwide (seven U.S. patents and nine foreign patents), along with one pending U.S. patent application and seven pending worldwide patent applications, including two that have received Notices of Allowability. The issued U.S. patents have a patent term until June 2029, including any patent term adjustment, and may be eligible for patent exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
Under the terms of the Juniper License Agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of four issued U.S. patents with patent terms until April 2024, November 2024, and September 2027, including patent term adjustment, and six issued foreign patents with patent terms until April 2024. We have one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application that will have national phase filings beginning in November 2019.
11

Under the terms of the Assignment Agreement with Hammock Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the License Amendment with TriLogic Pharma, LLC and MilanaPharm, LLC, we are the exclusive licensee of three issued U.S. Patents, two with patent terms until December 2028 and one with a patent term until June 2031 not including any patent term adjustment, and five foreign patents that have patent terms until December 2028. In addition, we have rights to four pending foreign patent applications and two pending U.S patent applications. If issued the patent term for these patents would be between 2036 and 2037 not including any patent term adjustment.
When we acquired Pear Tree Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in April 2018, we obtained the rights to three U.S. patents and one Japan patent. The patent term for two of the U.S. patents will expire in June 2027 and one will expire in May 2035 not including any patent term adjustment. The Japan patent has a term until June 2027. 
 We also rely upon trade secret rights to protect our product candidates as well as other technologies that may be used to discover, validate and commercialize our current or any future product candidates. We presently seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements.
Trademarks
We hold a domestic registration for the trademark Daré Bioscience. In accordance with the terms of the ADVA-Tec License Agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of the Ovaprene registered trademark.
Market Access
We intend to create a comprehensive global commercialization strategy in combination with established pharmaceutical partners and regional distributors.
Pre-Clinical Programs
In addition to our clinical-stage product candidates, we have licenses or other rights to the following pre-clinical stage product candidates in women’s health that meet our selection criteria of technology or product candidates with potential to expand options and improve outcomes, and that are easy and convenient to use: 

• | DARE-RH1, a novel approach to non-hormonal contraception for both men and women by targeting the CatSper ion channel;


• | ORB-204 and ORB-214, 6-month and 12-month formulations of injectable etonogestrel for contraception;


• | DARE-FRT1 (formerly JNP-0301), an intravaginal ring containing bio-identical progesterone for the prevention of preterm birth and for fertility support as part of an in vitro fertilization, or IVF, treatment plan;


• | DARE-OAB1 (formerly JNP-0101), an intravaginal ring containing oxybutynin for the treatment of overactive bladder; and


• | DARE-VVA1 (formerly PT-101), a vaginally delivered formulation of tamoxifen to treat vulvar vaginal atrophy, or VVA, in patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer

We may seek to acquire or license additional product candidates or technology to continue building a robust product pipeline over time.
Research and Development
Our research and development expenses during 2018 consisted primarily of the costs associated with building our portfolio of product candidates and with product development activities related to Ovaprene and Sildenafil Cream 3.6%, and to a lesser extent, DARE-BV1 and DARE-HRT1. Costs associated with our product development activities include the costs of: consultants and clinical trial sites that conduct research and development activities on our behalf; laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of clinical trials; contract manufacturing expenses, primarily for the production of clinical supplies; and internal costs associated with activities performed by us and our partners and generally benefit multiple programs. See PART II—Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” below for more information regarding our research and development expenses.
12

Competition
The industries in which we operate (biopharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device) are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change. We may not compete successfully against organizations with competitive products, particularly large pharmaceutical companies. Many of our potential competitors have greater clinical, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, compliance and financial resources and experience than we do. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS—Risks Related to our Business—We face intense competition from other medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively,” below.
Over the longer term, our ability, independently or otherwise, to successfully develop, manufacture, market, distribute and sell any approved products, expand their usage or bring additional new products to the marketplace will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, FDA and foreign regulatory agency approval of new products and of new indications for existing products, the efficacy and safety of our products (alone and relative to other treatment options), the degree of patent or other protection afforded to particular products, and reimbursement for use of those products.
Many other organizations are developing drug products and other therapies intended to treat the same diseases and conditions for which our product candidates are in development, and the success of others may render potential application of our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, even prior to completion of its development.
Suppliers
We rely on third parties to produce all of our clinical supplies, and we expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable future. In many cases the parties responsible for the finished product must also rely on third parties to provide raw materials, drugs and other materials required to produce a finished product and to produce the quantities needed. See "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Our success relies on third party suppliers, manufacturers and distributors, including multiple single source suppliers and manufacturers. We have no internal sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. Any failure by such third parties could negatively impact our business and our ability to develop and market any approved products," below.
DARE-BV1. We will be responsible for contracting with suppliers to produce our hydrogel formulation of clindamycin phosphate 2%. We expect the quantities of DARE-BV1 required to meet our foreseeable needs will generally be available and that multiple supply sources will be readily available.
Ovaprene. ADVA-Tec will be responsible for all activities related to process development and scale up of Ovaprene manufacturing. Further, either directly or via a contract manufacturing organization, ADVA-Tec will be responsible for Ovaprene clinical and commercial supply. For some key raw materials and components of Ovaprene, there is only a single source of supply, and alternate supply sources may not be readily available.
Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%. SST will be responsible for obtaining supplies of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% for the Phase 2 clinical studies expected to be conducted in the United States. Thereafter, we will be responsible for obtaining pre-clinical, clinical and commercial supplies of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%. We expect the quantities of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% required to meet our foreseeable needs will generally be available and that multiple supply sources will be readily available. 
DARE-HRT1. We will be responsible for contracting with manufacturers and suppliers to produce our intravaginal rings. We expect that the quantities of DARE-HRT1 required to meet our foreseeable needs will generally be available and that multiple supply sources will be readily available.
Government Regulation
Governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the testing, manufacturing, labeling and packaging, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing, and distribution, among other things, of pharmaceutical, medical device, and combination products. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal statutes and regulations, subject pharmaceutical and other regulated products to rigorous review. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may send us a warning letter, refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products, our products may be seized, the government may seek injunctions against us, and we may be criminally prosecuted.
13

We and our third-party manufacturers, distributors and contract research organizations, or CROs, may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state, and local laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Clean Air Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, privacy laws and import, export and customs regulations, as well as the laws and regulations of other countries.
FDA Approval Process for Prescription Drugs
To obtain approval of a new drug product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting its safety and efficacy, as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the drug and proposed product labeling. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates.
The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves some or all of the following key steps:

• | completion of nonclinical studies performed in compliance with FDA regulations;


• | design of a clinical protocol and its submission to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;


• | submission of an NDA after completion of pivotal clinical trials and FDA acceptance of that NDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP;


• | possible inspection of selected clinical sites to confirm compliance with good clinical practices, or GCP, requirements and data integrity; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug product in the U.S.

The clinical investigation of an investigational new drug is divided into three phases that typically are conducted sequentially but may overlap. The three phases are as follows:
Phase 1. Phase 1 includes initial clinical trials introducing an investigational new drug into humans and may be conducted in subjects with the target disease or normal volunteers. These trials are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in subjects with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 trials are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of subjects.
Phase 3. Phase 3 trials are typically large trials performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained. They are intended to gather additional information about the effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling and product marketing approval. Phase 3 trials usually are conducted at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA.
A pivotal trial is a clinical trial that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal trials, to support regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.
14

Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s GCP requirements. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, known as a "clinical hold," or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Occasionally, clinical holds are imposed due to manufacturing issues that may present safety issues for the clinical study subjects. An institutional review board, or IRB, is responsible for ensuring that human subjects in clinical studies are protected from inappropriate study risks. An IRB must approve the clinical trial design and process for obtaining subject informed consent at study sites that the IRB oversees and also may halt a study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with GCP or the IRB’s requirements.
As a product candidate moves through the clinical testing phases, manufacturing processes are further defined, refined, controlled and validated. The level of control and validation required by the FDA increases as clinical development progresses. We and the third-party manufacturers on which we rely for the manufacture of our product candidates and their respective components (including API) are subject to requirements that drugs be manufactured, packaged, tested, and labeled in conformity with cGMP. To comply with cGMP requirements, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to meet requirements relating to personnel, facilities, equipment, production and process, labeling and packaging, quality control, recordkeeping and other requirements.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information on the product candidate is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more indications, together with payment of a significant user fee, unless waived. An NDA includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information on the product candidate’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, or CMC, and proposed labeling, among other things. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use to the satisfaction of the FDA.
Most innovative drug products (other than biological products) obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, commonly referred to as a "full NDA." Another alternative is a special type of NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, commonly referred to as a 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy data for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs may provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products.
Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA in which the applicant relies, at least in part, on information from studies made to show whether a drug is safe or effective that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use. A Section 505(b)(2) applicant may eliminate or reduce the need to conduct certain pre-clinical or clinical studies, if it can establish that reliance on studies conducted for a previously-approved product is scientifically appropriate. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including nonclinical and clinical studies, to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication for which the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has submitted data.
The FDA reviews all NDAs, whether 505(b)(1) or 505(b)2 applications, submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days after submission of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing.
If an NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA sets a goal date by which it plans to complete its review. For a standard review, this goal date typically is ten months from the date of submission of the NDA application. If the NDA application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication and is designated for priority review, the FDA’s goal date typically is six (6) months from the date of NDA submission. However, PDUFA goal dates are not legal mandates and FDA response often occurs several months beyond the original PDUFA goal date. Further, the review process and the target response date under PDUFA may be extended if the FDA requests, or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides, additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the NDA. As a result, the NDA review process can be very lengthy. During its review of an NDA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee of independent experts for a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 
15

Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA or its advisory committee may interpret data differently than the NDA sponsor.
After evaluating the NDA and inspecting manufacturing facilities where the drug product or its API will be produced, the FDA will either approve commercial marketing of the drug product for specific indications of use or issue a complete response letter, or CRL, indicating that the application is not ready for approval and stating the conditions that must be met in order to secure approval of the NDA. If the CRL requires additional data and the applicant subsequently submits that data, the FDA nevertheless may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition drug approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing. Such post-marketing testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and efficacy after approval.
If the FDA approves any of our product candidates, we will be required to comply with a number of ongoing post-marketing regulatory requirements. We would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our prescription drug products, including submitting all of our advertising and promotional labeling to the FDA at the time those are publicly disseminated. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. If we seek to make certain changes to an approved product, such as certain manufacturing changes, we typically will need FDA approval before the change can be implemented. For example, if we change the manufacturer of a product or its API, the FDA may require stability or other data such as a bioequivalence study from the new manufacturer to assure the agency that the prior and new formulations are interchangeable, which data will take time and is costly to generate, and the delay associated with generating this data may cause interruptions in our ability to meet commercial demand, if any. Moreover, although physicians may use products for indications that have not been approved by the FDA, we may not label or promote the product for an indication that has not been approved pursuant to an NDA. Securing FDA approval for new indications is similar to the process for approval of the original indication and requires, among other things, submitting data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the product’s safety and efficacy in the new indication. Even if such trials are conducted, the FDA may not approve any expansion of the labeled indications for use in a timely fashion, or at all.
We rely on third parties for the manufacture of our clinical trial material and we expect to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of our drugs and devices, should they receive regulatory approval in the future. Future FDA, state, or foreign governmental agency inspections may identify compliance issues at these third-party facilities that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated, or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Many of the foregoing could limit the commercial value of a product or require us to commit substantial additional resources in connection with the approval of an investigational drug. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
Sales of our drug products, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, private health insurers, managed health care providers, and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging drug prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, even if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status for newly approved drug products, including coding, coverage and payment. Sales of any products for which we obtain marketing approval will depend in part on coverage and adequate payment from third-party payors. There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and 
16

reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States; therefore coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate payment will be applied consistently or obtained. The process for determining whether a payor will cover and how much it will reimburse a product may be separate from the process of seeking approval of the product or for setting the price of the product. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for health care providers or less profitable than alternative treatments or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use.
Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drug products have been a focus in this effort. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. We expect that federal, state and local governments in the U.S. will continue to consider legislation directed at lowering the total cost of health care. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of drug products is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable or insufficient.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on certain companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The ACA also increased the Medicaid rebate rate and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in Medicaid managed care organizations. The ACA also expanded the 340B drug discount program (excluding orphan drugs), including a 50% discount on brand name drugs for Medicare Part D participants in the coverage gap, and revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of the Medicaid drug rebates paid to states. It also contains substantial provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health care spending, enhance remedies against health care fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the health care industry, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business. Since its enactment there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Certain provisions of the ACA are not yet, or have only recently become, effective, and others have been temporarily suspended, but the ACA is likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken, Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. Strong, partisan disagreement in Congress has prevented implementation of various ACA provisions, while the Trump Administration has made repeal of the ACA a priority.  One of the first executive orders of the Trump administration granted federal agencies broad powers to unwind regulations under the ACA. On January 11, 2017, the Senate voted to approve a “budget blueprint” allowing Republicans to repeal parts of the law while avoiding Democrat filibuster.  The “Obamacare Repeal Resolution” passed 51-48.  Certain legislators are continuing their efforts to repeal the ACA, although there is little clarity on how such a repeal would be implemented and what an ACA replacement might look like.  For the immediate future, there is significant uncertainty regarding the health care, health care coverage and health care insurance markets.
It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or abroad, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions federal, state, or commercial payors for pharmaceutical products may take in response to any such health care reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
FDA Approval Process for Combination Products and Medical Devices
A combination product is a product composed of a combination of two or more FDA-regulated product components or products, e.g., drug-device or biologic-device. A combination product can take a variety of forms, such as a single entity made by physically or chemically combining components, or a single unit made of separately packaged 
17

products. Each combination product is assigned a lead FDA Center, which has jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation, based on which constituent part of the combination product provides the primary mode of action, i.e., the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effect of the product. If the classification as a combination product or the lead Center assignment is unclear or in dispute, a sponsor may request a meeting, submit a Request for Designation or RFD, and the FDA will issue a designation letter within 60 calendar days of the filing of the RFD. Depending on the type of combination product, the FDA may require a single application for approval, clearance, or licensure of the combination product, or separate applications for the constituent parts. During the review of marketing applications, the lead Center may consult or collaborate with other FDA Centers.
In 2017, the FDA released final documents addressing the application of cGMP requirements and classification issues relating to combination products. The 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, which became law in December 2016 and, among other things, amended provisions of the FDCA, sets forth a number of provisions pertaining to combination products, such as procedures for negotiating disagreements between sponsors and the FDA and requirements intended to streamline FDA premarket reviews of combination products that contain an already-approved component. For drug-device combination products, comprised of an FDA-approved drug and device primary mode of action, the Cures Act applies Hatch-Waxman requirements to the premarket review process such that a patent dispute regarding the listed drug may result in the delay of the 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of the combination product. Furthermore, the Cures Act applies exclusivity provisions (e.g., new chemical entity and orphan drug exclusivities) to the device clearance and approval process for combination products with a device primary mode of action.
Because the FDA has different centers responsible for assessing and approving devices, drugs, and biologics, the FDA’s response to an RFD submitted by a sponsor will assign a lead center for the combination product. The CDRH has oversight responsibility for medical devices, while the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, has responsibility for drug products.  Because combination products involve components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory regimes, and frequently by different FDA Centers, they raise challenging regulatory, policy, and review management challenges. Differences in regulatory pathways for each component can impact the regulatory processes for all aspects of product development and management, including pre-clinical testing, clinical investigation, marketing applications, manufacturing and quality control, adverse event reporting, promotion and advertising, and post-approval modifications.
The development and approval process for combination products designated as having a drug-primary mode of action and assigned to CDER generally will follow the procedures set forth above for pharmaceutical products. Similarly, medical devices and combination products with a device-primary mode of action may also be subject to FDA approval and extensive regulation under the FDCA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes: Class I, Class II, or Class III. A higher class indicates a greater degree of risk associated with the device and a greater amount of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness.
All devices, unless exempt by FDA regulation, must adhere to a set of general controls, including compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which sets forth good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices, including stringent design controls; facility registration and product listing; reporting of adverse medical events; truthful and non-misleading labeling; and promotion of the device consistent with its cleared or approved intended uses. Class II devices are subject to additional special controls and may require FDA clearance of a premarket notification (510(k)). Class III devices, which involve those posing the greatest health risk, require approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA.
Most Class I devices are exempt from FDA premarket review or approval. Class II devices, with some exceptions, must be “cleared” by the FDA through the 510(k) process, which requires a company to show that the device is “substantially equivalent” to certain devices already on the market. Class III devices, again with some exceptions, must be approved through a PMA. A PMA generally requires data from clinical trials that establish the safety and effectiveness of the device. A 510(k) application also sometimes requires clinical data. The Cures Act requires the FDA to establish a program that would expedite access to devices that provide more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions, for which no approved or cleared treatment exists or which offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives; in 2018, the FDA published its final guidance on this “breakthrough” devices pathway.
Clinical trials for medical devices are subject to similar requirements as clinical trials with pharmaceutical products. Clinical trials involving significant risk devices (e.g., devices that present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of human subjects) are required to obtain both FDA approval of an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application and IRB approval before study initiation; clinical trials involving non-significant risk devices are not required to submit an IDE for FDA approval but must obtain IRB approval before study initiation.

The FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers with respect to medical devices, similar to those for pharmaceutical products. The FDA requires medical device manufacturers to comply with detailed requirements regarding device design and manufacturing practices, labeling and promotion, record keeping, and adverse event reporting. As with pharmaceutical products, states also impose regulatory requirements on medical device manufacturers and distributors. Failure to comply with the applicable federal or state requirements could result in, among other things: (1) fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; (2) recall or seizure of products; (3) operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of manufacturing; (4) refusing requests for approval of new products; (5) withdrawing approvals already granted; and (6) criminal prosecution.
The FDA also administers certain controls over the import and export of medical devices to and from the United States. Additionally, each foreign country subjects medical devices to its own regulatory requirements. In the European Union, a single regulatory approval process has been created, and approval is represented by the CE Mark, which requires conformity to a Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, that went into effect in 2017 and imposed significant new requirements.
Other Health Care Laws and Compliance Requirements
In addition to FDA requirements, several other types of state and federal laws apply and will apply to our operations. These laws include, among others, health care information and data privacy protection laws, transparency laws, and fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws.
The federal health care program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed health care programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
Federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly promoting their products for uses for which they were not approved and causing the submission of claims for payment for such use under federal health care programs.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
The ACA also includes federal transparency requirements that apply to certain manufacturers of drug products, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies and require them to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests.  Compliance with such "Sunshine Act" reporting requirements may be costly for us once we have a drug product in commercial distribution and it is reimbursed by Medicaid.  
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. We may be subject to state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.  In addition, we may be subject to reporting requirements under state transparency laws, as well as state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to health care providers and entities.
Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under federal and other governmental health care programs, we expect to develop a compliance program that establishes internal controls to 
19

facilitate adherence to the rules and health care program requirements.  Although compliance programs and adherence thereto may mitigate the risk of violation of and subsequent investigation and prosecution for violations of the laws described above, the risks cannot be eliminated entirely.  In addition, due to the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under U.S. federal or state health care programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Government Regulation Outside the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we may be subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions that govern, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing and sale of the product in those countries. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval described above. Some foreign jurisdictions have a drug product approval process similar to that in the U.S., which requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of clinical studies. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
To obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate under European Union regulatory systems, we would be required to submit a Marketing Authorisation Application, which is similar to the NDA, except that, among other things, there are country-specific document requirements. For countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. And, some nations may not accept clinical studies performed for U.S. approval to support approval in their countries or require that additional studies be performed on natives of their countries. In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the U.S. We face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or any future partner of ours. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had nine full-time and five part-time employees, six in research and development and seven in general and administrative. Given the differing characteristics of our product candidates, our approach is to engage consultants with experience in varying specialties to help us develop such candidates. Our numerous consultants serve as an extension to our full-time employee base. We believe this approach will enable us to access the expertise needed in a cost-efficient manner and without the need to expand the number of full-time employees and their associated costs.
Company Information
Until July 2017, our corporate name was Cerulean Pharma Inc., or Cerulean. Cerulean was incorporated in Delaware in December 2005. On July 19, 2017, Cerulean and Daré Bioscience Operations, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation, or Private Daré, completed a transaction in which the holders of capital stock and securities convertible into capital stock of Private Daré, which holders are collectively referred to as the Private Daré Stockholders, sold their shares of capital stock of Private Daré to Cerulean in exchange for newly issued shares of Cerulean common stock. As a result of that transaction, Private Daré became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cerulean. As of immediately following the closing of that transaction: (i) the Private Daré Stockholders owned approximately 51% of the outstanding common stock of Cerulean, and (ii) the equity holders of Cerulean immediately prior to the closing, collectively, owned approximately 49% of the outstanding common stock of Cerulean. In connection with the transaction, Cerulean changed its name from “Cerulean Pharma Inc.” to “Daré Bioscience, Inc.”
We and our wholly owned subsidiaries, Private Daré, Daré Bioscience Australia Pty LTD, and Pear Tree Pharmaceuticals, Inc., operate in one business segment.
On July 20, 2017, we effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of our common stock. All share and per share amounts of common stock, options and warrants in this report, including those amounts included in the 
20

accompanying consolidated financial statements, have been restated for all periods to give retroactive effect to the reverse stock split.
