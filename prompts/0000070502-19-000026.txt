Item 1. | Business


OVERVIEW

National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation (“CFC”) is a member-owned cooperative association incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia in April 1969. CFC’s principal purpose is to provide its members with financing to supplement the loan programs of the Rural Utilities Service (“RUS”) of the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). CFC makes loans to its rural electric members so they can acquire, construct and operate electric distribution, generation and transmission (“power supply”) systems and related facilities. CFC also provides its members with credit enhancements in the form of letters of credit and guarantees of debt obligations. As a cooperative, CFC is owned by and exclusively serves its membership, which consists of not-for-profit entities or subsidiaries or affiliates of not-for-profit entities. CFC is exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. As a member-owned cooperative, CFC’s objective is not to maximize profit, but rather to offer members cost-based financial products and services. As described below under “Allocation and Retirement of Patronage Capital,” CFC annually allocates its net earnings, which consist of net income excluding the effect of certain noncash accounting entries, to: (i) a cooperative educational fund; (ii) a general reserve, if necessary; (iii) members based on each member’s patronage of CFC’s loan programs during the year; and (iv) a members’ capital reserve. CFC funds its activities primarily through a combination of public and private issuances of debt securities, member investments and retained equity. As a Section 501(c)(4) tax-exempt, member-owned cooperative, we cannot issue equity securities.
Our financial statements include the consolidated accounts of CFC, National Cooperative Services Corporation (“NCSC”), Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (“RTFC”) and subsidiaries created and controlled by CFC to hold foreclosed assets resulting from defaulted loans or bankruptcy. We did not carry any foreclosed assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2019 or May 31, 2018. Unless stated otherwise, references to “we,” “our” or “us” relate to CFC and its consolidated entities. All references to members within this document include members, associates and affiliates of CFC and its consolidated entities, except where indicated otherwise. 
NCSC is a taxable cooperative incorporated in 1981 in the District of Columbia as a member-owned cooperative association. The principal purpose of NCSC is to provide financing to its members, entities eligible to be members of CFC and the for-profit and not-for-profit entities that are owned, operated or controlled by, or provide significant benefit to Class 
1

A, B and C members of CFC. See “Members” below for a description of our member classes. NCSC’s membership consists of distribution systems, power supply systems and statewide and regional associations that were members of CFC as of May 31, 2019. CFC, which is the primary source of funding for NCSC, manages NCSC’s business operations under a management agreement that is automatically renewable on an annual basis unless terminated by either party. NCSC pays CFC a fee and, in exchange, CFC reimburses NCSC for loan losses under a guarantee agreement. As a taxable cooperative, NCSC pays income tax based on its reported taxable income and deductions. NCSC is headquartered with CFC in Dulles, Virginia. 
RTFC is a taxable Subchapter T cooperative association originally incorporated in South Dakota in 1987 and reincorporated as a member-owned cooperative association in the District of Columbia in 2005. RTFC’s principal purpose is to provide financing for its rural telecommunications members and their affiliates. RTFC’s membership consists of a combination of not-for-profit and for-profit entities. CFC is the sole lender to and manages RTFC’s business operations through a management agreement that is automatically renewable on an annual basis unless terminated by either party. RTFC pays CFC a fee and, in exchange, CFC reimburses RTFC for loan losses under a guarantee agreement. As permitted under Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code, RTFC pays income tax based on its taxable income, excluding patronage-sourced earnings allocated to its patrons. RTFC is headquartered with CFC in Dulles, Virginia.
Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three business segments: CFC, NCSC and RTFC. We provide information on the financial performance of our business segments in “Note 15—Business Segments.” 

OUR BUSINESS

Our business strategy and policies are set by our board of directors and may be amended or revised from time to time by the board of directors. We are a nonprofit tax-exempt cooperative finance organization, whose primary focus is to provide our members with the credit products they need to fund their operations. As such, our business focuses on lending to electric systems and securing access to capital through diverse funding sources at rates that allow us to offer cost-based credit products to our members.
Focus on Electric Lending
CFC focuses on lending to its member electric utility cooperatives. Substantially all of our electric cooperative borrowers continue to demonstrate stable operating performance and strong financial ratios. Our electric cooperative members experience limited competition as they generally operate in exclusive territories and the majority are not rate regulated. Loans to electric utility organizations represented approximately 99% of total loans outstanding as of both May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Maintain Diversified Funding Sources 
We strive to maintain diversified funding sources beyond capital market offerings of debt securities. We offer various short- and long-term unsecured investment products to our members and affiliates, including commercial paper, select notes, daily liquidity fund notes, medium-term notes and subordinated certificates. We continue to issue debt securities, such as secured collateral trust bonds, unsecured medium-term notes and dealer commercial paper, in the capital markets. We also have access to funds through bank revolving line of credit arrangements, government-guaranteed programs such as funding from the Federal Financing Bank that is guaranteed by RUS through the Guaranteed Underwriter Program of the USDA (the “Guaranteed Underwriter Program”), as well as private placement note purchase agreements with the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (“Farmer Mac”). We provide additional information on our funding sources in “Item 7. MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis,” “Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity Risk,” “Note 6—Short-Term Borrowings,” “Note 7—Long-Term Debt,” “Note 8—Subordinated Deferrable Debt” and “Note 9—Members’ Subordinated Certificates.”

LOAN PROGRAMS

CFC lends to its members and associates. NCSC lends to its members, entities eligible to be members of CFC and its associates, for-profit and nonprofit entities that are owned, operated or controlled by, or provide significant benefit, to CFC members. RTFC lends to its members, associates and organizations affiliated with its members and associates. See “Item 1. Business—Members” for additional information on the entities that comprise our membership. Loans to NCSC associates may require a guarantee of repayment to NCSC from the CFC member cooperative with which it is affiliated. CFC, NCSC and RTFC loans generally contain provisions that restrict further borrower advances or trigger an event of default if there is any material adverse change in the business or condition, financial or otherwise, of the borrower. 
CFC Loan Programs
Long-Term Loans
CFC’s long-term loans generally have the following characteristics:

• | terms of up to 35 years on a senior secured basis;


• | amortizing, bullet maturity or serial payment structures;


• | the property, plant and equipment financed by and securing the long-term loan has a useful life equal to or in excess of the loan maturity;


• | flexibility for the borrower to select a fixed interest rate for periods of one to 35 years or a variable interest rate; and


• | the ability for the borrower to select various tranches with either a fixed or variable interest rate for each tranche.

Borrowers typically have the option of selecting a fixed or variable interest rate at the time of each advance on long-term loan facilities. When selecting a fixed rate, the borrower has the option to choose a fixed rate for a term of one year through the final maturity of the loan. When the selected fixed interest rate term expires, the borrower may select another fixed rate for a term of one year through the remaining loan maturity or the current variable rate. Long-term fixed rates are set daily for new loan advances and loans that reprice. The fixed rate on each loan is generally determined on the day the loan is advanced or repriced based on the term selected. The variable rate is set on the first day of each month.
To be in compliance with the covenants in the loan agreement and eligible for loan advances, distribution systems generally must maintain an average modified debt service coverage ratio, as defined in the loan agreement, of 1.35 or greater. CFC may make long-term loans to distribution systems, on a case-by-case basis, that do not meet these general criteria. Power supply systems generally are required: (i) to maintain an average modified debt service coverage ratio, as defined in the loan agreement, of 1.00 or greater; (ii) to establish and collect rates and other revenue in an amount to yield margins for interest, as defined in an indenture, in each fiscal year sufficient to equal at least 1.00; or (iii) both. CFC may make long-term loans to power supply systems, on a case-by-case basis, that may include other requirements, such as maintenance of a minimum equity level.
Line of Credit Loans
Line of credit loans are designed primarily to assist borrowers with liquidity and cash management and are generally advanced at variable interest rates. Line of credit loans are typically revolving facilities. Certain line of credit loans require the borrower to pay off the principal balance for at least five consecutive business days at least once during each 12-month period. Line of credit loans are generally unsecured and may be conditional or unconditional facilities. 
Line of credit loans also are made available as interim financing when a member either receives RUS approval to obtain a loan and is awaiting its initial advance of funds or submits a loan application that is pending approval from RUS (sometimes referred to as “bridge loans”). In these cases, when the borrower receives the RUS loan advance, the funds must be used to repay the bridge loans.
Syndicated Line of Credit Loans
A syndicated line of credit loan is typically a large financing offered by a group of lenders that work together to provide funds for a single borrower. Syndicated loans are generally unsecured, floating-rate loans that can be provided on a 
3

revolving or term basis for tenors that range from several months to five years. Syndicated financings are arranged for borrowers on a case-by-case basis. CFC may act as lead lender, arranger and/or administrative agent for the syndicated facilities. CFC will syndicate these line of credit facilities on a best effort basis.
NCSC Loan Programs
Long-Term Loans
NCSC’s long-term loans generally have the following characteristics:

• | terms of up to 35 years on a senior secured or unsecured basis;


• | amortizing, bullet maturity or serial payment structures;


• | the property, plant and equipment financed by and securing the long-term loan has a useful life equal to or in excess of the loan maturity;


• | flexibility for the borrower to select a fixed interest rate for periods of one to 35 years or a variable interest rate; and


• | the ability for the borrower to select various tranches with either a fixed or variable interest rate for each tranche.

NCSC allows borrowers to select a fixed interest rate or a variable interest rate at the time of each advance on long-term loan facilities. When selecting a fixed rate, the borrower has the option to choose a fixed rate for a term of one year through the final maturity of the loan. When the selected fixed interest rate term expires, the borrower may select another fixed rate for a term of one year through the remaining loan maturity or the current variable rate. The fixed rate on a loan generally is determined on the day the loan is advanced or repriced based on the term selected. The variable rate is set on the first day of each month. 
Line of Credit Loans
NCSC also provides revolving line of credit loans to assist borrowers with liquidity and cash management on terms similar to those provided by CFC as described herein. 
RTFC Loan Programs

Long-Term Loans
RTFC primarily makes long-term loans to rural local exchange carriers or holding companies of rural local exchange carriers for debt refinancing, construction or upgrades of infrastructure, acquisitions and other corporate purposes. Most of these rural telecommunications companies have diversified their operations and also provide broadband services. 
RTFC’s long-term loans generally have the following characteristics:

• | terms not exceeding 10 years on a senior secured basis;


• | amortizing or bullet maturity payment structures;


• | the property, plant and equipment financed by and securing the long-term loan has a useful life equal to or in excess of the loan maturity;


• | flexibility for the borrower to select a fixed interest rate for periods from one year to the final loan maturity or a variable interest rate; and


• | the ability for the borrower to select various tranches with either a fixed or variable interest rate for each tranche.

When a selected fixed interest rate term expires, generally the borrower may select another fixed-rate term or the current variable rate. The fixed rate on a loan is generally determined on the day the loan is advanced or converted to a fixed rate based on the term selected. The variable rate is set on the first day of each month.
To borrow from RTFC, a rural telecommunication system generally must be able to demonstrate the ability to achieve and maintain an annual debt service coverage ratio of 1.25. RTFC may make long-term loans to rural telecommunication systems, on a case-by-case basis, that do not meet this general criterion.

Line of Credit Loans
RTFC also provides revolving line of credit loans to assist borrowers with liquidity and cash management on terms similar to those provided by CFC as described herein. 
Loan Features and Options
Interest Rates 
As a member-owned cooperative finance organization, we are a cost-based lender. As such, our interest rates are set based on a yield that we believe will generate a reasonable level of earnings to cover our cost of funding, general and administrative expenses and loan loss provision. Various standardized discounts may reduce the stated interest rates for borrowers meeting certain criteria related to performance, volume, collateral and equity requirements.
Conversion Option
Generally, a borrower may convert a long-term loan from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate at any time without a fee and convert a long-term loan from a fixed rate to another fixed rate or to a variable rate at any time based on current loan policies.
Prepayment Option
Generally, borrowers may prepay long-term fixed-rate loans at any time, subject to payment of an administrative fee and a make-whole premium, and prepay long-term variable-rate loans at any time, subject to payment of an administrative fee. Line of credit loans may be prepaid at any time without a fee.
Loan Security
Long-term loans made by CFC typically are senior secured on parity with other secured lenders (primarily RUS), if any, by all assets and revenue of the borrower, subject to standard liens typical in utility mortgages such as those related to taxes, worker’s compensation awards, mechanics’ and similar liens, rights-of-way and governmental rights. We are able to obtain liens on parity with liens for the benefit of RUS because RUS’ form of mortgage expressly provides for other lenders such as CFC to have a parity lien position if the borrower satisfies certain conditions or obtains a written lien accommodation from RUS. When we make loans to borrowers that have existing loans from RUS, we generally require those borrowers to either obtain such a lien accommodation or satisfy the conditions necessary for our loan to be secured on parity under the mortgage with the loan from RUS. As noted above, CFC line of credit loans generally are unsecured.
We provide additional information on our loan programs in “Item 7. MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis,” “Item 7. MD&A—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” and “Item 7. MD&A—Credit Risk.”

GUARANTEE PROGRAMS

When we guarantee our members’ debt obligations, we use the same credit policies and monitoring procedures for guarantees as for loans. If a member system defaults in its obligation to pay debt service, then we are obligated to pay any required amounts under our guarantees. Meeting our guarantee obligations satisfies the underlying obligation of our member systems and prevents the exercise of remedies by the guarantee beneficiary based upon a payment default by a member system. The member system is required to repay any amount advanced by us with interest pursuant to the documents evidencing the member system’s reimbursement obligation. We were not required to perform pursuant to any of our guarantee obligations during the year ended May 31, 2019.
Guarantees of Long-Term Tax-Exempt Bonds
We guarantee debt issued for our members’ construction or acquisition of pollution control, solid waste disposal, industrial development and electric distribution facilities. Governmental authorities issue such debt on a nonrecourse basis and the 
5

interest thereon is exempt from federal taxation. The proceeds of the offering are made available to the member system, which in turn is obligated to pay the governmental authority amounts sufficient to service the debt. 
If a system defaults for failure to make the debt payments and any available debt service reserve funds have been exhausted, we are obligated to pay scheduled debt service under our guarantee. Such payment will prevent the occurrence of an event of payment default that would otherwise permit acceleration of the bond issue. The system is required to repay any amount that we advance pursuant to our guarantee plus interest on that advance. This repayment obligation, together with the interest thereon, is typically senior secured on parity with other lenders (including, in most cases, RUS), by a lien on substantially all of the system’s assets. If the security instrument is a common mortgage with RUS, then in general, we may not exercise remedies for up to two years following default. However, if the debt is accelerated under the common mortgage because of a determination that the related interest is not tax-exempt, the system’s obligation to reimburse us for any guarantee payments will be treated as a long-term loan. The system is required to pay us initial and/or ongoing guarantee fees in connection with these transactions.
Certain guaranteed long-term debt bears interest at variable rates that are adjusted at intervals of one to 270 days including weekly, every five weeks or semi-annually to a level favorable to their resale or auction at par. If funding sources are available, the member that issued the debt may choose a fixed interest rate on the debt. When the variable rate is reset, holders of variable-rate debt have the right to tender the debt for purchase at par. In some transactions, we have committed to purchase this debt as liquidity provider if it cannot otherwise be re-marketed. If we hold the securities, the member cooperative pays us the interest earned on the bonds or interest calculated based on our short-term variable interest rate, whichever is greater. The system is required to pay us stand-by liquidity fees in connection with these transactions. 
Letters of Credit
In exchange for a fee, we issue irrevocable letters of credit to support members’ obligations to energy marketers, other third parties and to the USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service. Each letter of credit is supported by a reimbursement agreement with the member on whose behalf the letter of credit was issued. In the event a beneficiary draws on a letter of credit, the agreement generally requires the member to reimburse us within one year from the date of the draw, with interest accruing from the draw date at our line of credit variable interest rate.
The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has designated CFC as an acceptable source for letters of credit in support of USDA and FCC programs that encourage deployment of high-speed broadband services throughout rural America. The designation allows CFC to provide credit support for rural electric and telecommunication cooperatives that participate in programs designed to increase deployment of broadband services to underserved rural areas.
Other Guarantees
We may provide other guarantees as requested by our members. Other guarantees are generally unsecured with guarantee fees payable to us.
We provide additional information on our guarantee programs and outstanding guarantee amounts as of May 31, 2019 and 2018 in “Item 7. MD&A—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” and “Note 13—Guarantees.”

All of these investments are subject to requirements, and limitations set forth in our investment policy.

INDUSTRY

Overview
Since the enactment of the Rural Electrification Act in 1936, RUS has financed the construction of electric generating plants, transmission facilities and distribution systems to provide electricity to rural areas. Today, with CFC membership comprised, in part, of rural electric utility systems in 49 states and three U.S. territories, the percentage of farms and residences in rural areas of the United States receiving central station electric service increased from 11% in 1934 to almost 100% currently. 
RUS provides loans, guarantees and other forms of financial assistance to rural electric system borrowers. Under the Rural Electrification Act, RUS is authorized to make direct loans to systems that qualify for the hardship program (5% interest rate), the municipal rate program (based on a municipal government obligation index) and a Treasury rate program (at Treasury plus 0.125%). RUS also is authorized to guarantee loans that bear interest at a rate agreed upon by the borrower and the lender (which generally has been the Federal Financing Bank). RUS exercises oversight of borrowers’ operations. Its loans and guarantees are secured by a mortgage or indenture on substantially all of the system’s assets and revenue.
Leading up to CFC’s formation in 1969, there was a growing need for capital for electric cooperatives to build new electric facilities due to growth in rural America. The electric cooperatives formed CFC to provide a supplemental financing source to RUS loan programs and to mitigate uncertainty related to government funding. 
CFC aggregates the combined strength of its rural electric member cooperatives to access the public capital markets and other funding sources. CFC works cooperatively with RUS; however, CFC is not a federal agency or a government-sponsored enterprise. Our members are not required to have outstanding loans from RUS as a condition of borrowing from CFC. CFC meets the financial needs of its rural electric members by:

• | providing financing to RUS-eligible rural electric systems for infrastructure, including for those facilities that are not eligible for financing from RUS;


• | providing bridge loans required by borrowers in anticipation of receiving RUS funding;


• | providing financial products not otherwise available from RUS, including lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees on tax-exempt financing, weather-related disaster recovery lines of credit, unsecured loans and investment products such as commercial paper, member capital securities, select notes and medium-term notes; and


• | meeting the financing needs of those rural electric systems that repay or prepay their RUS loans and replace the government loans with private capital.

Many electric cooperatives are making investments in fiber to support core electric plant communications. Some of these electric cooperatives are leveraging these fiber assets to offer broadband services, either directly or through partnering with local telecommunication companies and others.

Electric Member Operating Environment
In general, electric cooperatives have not been significantly impacted by the effects of retail deregulation. There were 19 states that had adopted programs that allow consumers to choose their supplier of electricity as of May 31, 2019. Depending on the state, the choices can range from being limited to commercial and industrial consumers to “retail choice” for all consumers. In most states, cooperatives have been exempted from or have been allowed to opt out of the regulations allowing for competition. In states offering retail competition, it is important to note that while consumers may be able to choose their energy supplier, the electric utility still receives compensation for the necessary service of delivering electricity to consumers through its utility transmission and distribution plant.  
The electric industry is facing a potential decrease to kilowatt-hour sales due to technology advances that increase energy efficiency of all appliances and devices used in the home and in businesses as well as from distributed generation in the form of rooftop solar and home generators (“behind-the-meter generation”). Electric cooperatives are facing the same issues, but in general to a lesser extent than investor-owned power systems. Electric cooperatives have options available to mitigate the impact of such issues, such as rate structures to ensure that costs are appropriately recovered for grid and other necessary ancillary services. To date, we have not seen negative impacts in the electric cooperative financial results due to behind-the-meter generation.
Regulatory Oversight
There are 11 states in which some or all electric cooperatives are subject to state regulatory oversight of their rates and tariffs (terms and conditions) by state utility commissions. Those states are Arizona, Arkansas, Hawaii, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.
Regulatory jurisdiction by state commissions generally includes rate and tariff regulation, the issuance of securities and the enforcement of service territory as provided for by state law.
Parts II and III of the Federal Power Act (“FPA”) provide the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) with regulatory authority over three aspects of electric power: 

• | the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce;


• | the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce; and


• | the approval and enforcement of reliability standards affecting all users, owners and operators of the bulk power system.

The FERC also regulates the issuance of securities by public utilities under the FPA provided the state commission does not.
Our distribution and power supply members are subject to regulation by various federal, regional, state and local authorities with respect to the environmental effects of their operations. At the federal level, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) from time to time proposes rulemakings that could force the electric utility industry to incur capital costs to comply with potential new regulations and possibly retire coal-fired generating capacity. Since there are only 11 states in which some or all electric cooperatives are subject to state regulatory oversight of their rates and tariffs, in most cases any associated costs of compliance can be passed on to cooperative consumers without additional regulatory approval. On 
June 19, 2019, the EPA issued the final Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule. The ACE rule replaces the 2015 Clean Power Plan, which was stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court and never went into effect. Falling under Section 111(d) of the Federal Clean Air Act, the ACE rule addresses existing sources of emissions and sets a framework under which states should develop plans establishing standards of performance for their existing emissions sources and then submit those plans to the EPA for approval. States will have three years from the date of the final rule to prepare and submit a plan that establishes a standard of performance. It is expected that certain states and environmental groups will challenge the ACE rule in federal litigation.

LENDING COMPETITION

RUS is the largest lender to electric cooperatives. RUS provides long-term secured loans. CFC provides financial products and services, primarily in the form of long-term secured and short-term unsecured loans, to its electric cooperative members to supplement RUS financing, to provide loans to members that have elected not to borrow from RUS, and to bridge long-term financing provided by RUS. 
CFC’s primary competitor is CoBank, ACB, a federally chartered instrumentality of the United States that is a member of the Farm Credit System. CFC also competes with banks, other financial institutions and the capital markets to provide loans and other financial products to our members. As a result, we are competing with the customer service, pricing and funding options our members are able to obtain from these sources. We attempt to minimize the effect of competition by offering a variety of loan options and value-added services and by leveraging the working relationships developed with the majority of our members over the past 50 years. Further, on an annual basis, we allocate substantially all net earnings to members (i) in the form of patronage capital, which reduces our members’ effective cost of borrowing, and (ii) through the members’ capital reserve. The value-added services that we provide include, but are not limited to, benchmarking tools, financial models, publications and various conferences, meetings and training workshops. 
In order to meet other financing needs of our members, we offer options that include credit support in the form of letters of credit and guarantees, loan syndications and loan participations. Our credit products are tailored to meet the specific needs of each member cooperative, and we often offer specific transaction structures that our competitors do not provide. CFC also offers certain risk mitigation products and interest rate discounts on secured, long-term loans for its members that meet certain criteria, including performance, volume, collateral and equity requirements.
CFC has established certain funds to benefit its members. Since 1981, CFC has set aside a portion of its annual net earnings in a cooperative educational fund to promote awareness and appreciation of the cooperative principles. As directed by the CFC Board of Directors, a portion of the contributions to the fund are distributed through the electric cooperative statewide associations. Since 1986, CFC has supported its members’ efforts to protect their service territories from erosion or takeover by other utilities through assistance from the cooperative system integrity fund, which is funded through voluntary contributions from members. Amounts from the integrity fund are distributed to applicants who establish that: (i) all or a significant portion of their consumers, services or facilities face a hostile threat of acquisition or annexation by a competing entity; (ii) face a significant threat in their ability to continue to provide non-electric energy services to customers; or (iii) are facing regulatory, judicial or legislative challenges that threaten their existence under the cooperative business model.
Our rural electric borrowers are mostly private companies; thus, the overall size of the rural electric lending market cannot be determined from public information. We estimate the size of the overall rural electric lending market from the annual financial and statistical reports filed with us by our members using calendar year data; however, there are certain limitations with regard to these estimates, including the following:

• | while the underlying data included in the financial and statistical reports may be audited, the preparation of the financial and statistical reports is not audited;


• | in some cases, not all members provide the annual financial and statistical reports on a timely basis to be included in summarized results; and


• | the financial and statistical reports do not include comprehensive data on indebtedness by lenders other than RUS.

The following table displays long-term debt outstanding to CFC, RUS and other lenders in the electric cooperative industry as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, based on financial data reported to us by our electric utility cooperative members. The data as of December 31, 2018 was provided by 812 distribution systems and 54 power supply systems, while the data as of December 31, 2017 was provided by 812 distribution systems and 58 power supply systems.

Long-term debt funded by CFC | $ | 22,897,749 | | | 100 | % | | $ | 22,671,264 | | 100 | %

We are not able to specifically identify the amount of debt our members have outstanding to CoBank, ACB, from either the annual financial and statistical reports our members file with us or from CoBank, ACB’s public disclosure; however, we believe CoBank, ACB, is the additional lender, along with CFC and RUS, with significant long-term debt outstanding to rural electric cooperatives.

REGULATION

General
CFC, NCSC and RTFC are not subject to direct federal regulatory oversight or supervision with regard to lending. CFC, NCSC and RTFC are subject to state and local jurisdiction commercial lending and tax laws that pertain to business conducted in each state, including but not limited to lending laws, usury laws and laws governing mortgages. These state and local laws regulate the manner in which we make loans and conduct other types of transactions. The statutes, regulations and policies to which the companies are subject may change at any time. In addition, the interpretation and application by regulators of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may change from time to time. Certain of our contractual arrangements, such as those pertaining to funding obtained through the Guaranteed Underwriter Program, provide for the Federal Financing Bank and RUS to periodically review and assess CFC’s compliance with program terms and conditions. 
Derivatives Regulation
CFC engages in over-the-counter derivative transactions to manage interest rate risk. As an end user of derivative financial instruments, CFC is subject to regulations that apply to derivatives generally. The Dodd-Frank Act (“DFA”), enacted July 2010, resulted in, among other things, comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives market. The DFA provides for an extensive framework for the regulation of OTC derivatives, including mandatory clearing, exchange 
10

trading and transaction reporting of certain OTC derivatives. Subsequent to the enactment of the DFA, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) issued a final rule, “Clearing Exemption for Certain Swaps Entered into by Cooperatives,” which created an exemption from mandatory clearing for cooperatives. The CFTC’s final rule, “Margin Requirements for Uncleared Swaps for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants,” includes an exemption from margin requirements for uncleared swaps for cooperatives that are financial end users. CFC is an exempt cooperative end user of derivative financial instruments and does not participate in the derivatives markets for speculative, trading or investing purposes and does not make a market in derivatives.

MEMBERS

Our consolidated membership, after taking into consideration entities that are members of both CFC and NCSC and eliminating memberships between CFC, NCSC and RTFC, totaled 1,447 members and 222 associates as of May 31, 2019. 
CFC
CFC’s bylaws provide that cooperative or nonprofit corporations, public corporations, utility districts and other public bodies that received or are eligible to receive a loan or commitment for a loan from RUS or any successor agency (as well as subsidiaries, federations or statewide and regional associations that are wholly owned or controlled by such entities) are eligible for membership. One of the criteria for eligibility for RUS financing is a “rural area” test. CFC relies on the definition of “rural” as specified in the Rural Electrification Act, as amended. “Rural” is defined in the Rural Electrification Act as any area other than a city, town or unincorporated area that has a population of less than 20,000, or any area within the service area of a borrower who, at the date of enactment of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, had an outstanding RUS electric loan. The definition of “rural” under the act permits an area to be defined as “rural” regardless of the development of such area subsequent to the approval of the outstanding loan. Thus, those entities that received or qualify for financing from RUS are eligible to apply for membership, upon approval of membership by the CFC Board of Directors, and subsequently to borrow from CFC regardless of whether there is an outstanding loan with RUS. There are no requirements to maintain membership, although the board has the authority to suspend a member under certain circumstances. CFC has not suspended a member to date.
CFC has the following types of members, all of which are not-for-profit entities or subsidiaries or affiliates of not-for-profit entities. 
Class A – Distribution Systems
Cooperative or nonprofit corporations, public corporations, utility districts and other public bodies, which received or are eligible to receive a loan or commitment for a loan from RUS or any successor agency, and that are engaged or planning to engage in furnishing utility services to their members and patrons for their use as ultimate consumers. The majority of our distribution system members are consumer-owned electric cooperatives.
Distribution systems are utilities engaged in retail sales of electricity to residential and commercial consumers in their defined service areas. Such sales are generally on an exclusive basis using the distribution system’s infrastructure, including substations, wires and related support systems. Distribution systems vary in size from small systems that serve a few thousand customers to large systems that serve more than 200,000 customers. Thus, the amount of loan funding required by different distribution systems varies significantly. Distribution systems may serve customers in more than one state.
Most distribution systems have long-term power purchase contracts with their power supply systems, which are owned and controlled by the member distribution systems. Wholesale power for resale also comes from other sources, including power supply contracts with government agencies, investor-owned utilities and other entities, and, in some cases, the distribution systems own generating facilities.
Class B – Power Supply Systems
Cooperative or nonprofit corporations that are federations of Class A members or of other Class B members, or both, or that are owned and controlled by Class A members or by other Class B members, or both, and that are engaged or planning to 
11

engage in furnishing utility services primarily to Class A members or other Class B members. Our power supply system members are member-owned electric cooperatives.
The power supply systems vary in size from one with thousands of megawatts of power generation capacity to systems that have no generating capacity, which generally operate transmission lines to supply certain distribution systems or manage power supply purchase arrangements for the benefit of their distribution system members. Thus, the amount of loan funding required by different power supply systems varies significantly. Power supply members may serve distribution systems located in more than one state.
The wholesale power supply contracts with their distribution system members permit the power supply system, subject to regulatory approval in certain instances, to establish rates to produce revenue sufficient to cover debt service, to meet the cost of operation and maintenance of all power supply systems and related facilities and to pay the cost of any power and energy purchased for resale.
Class C – Statewide and Regional Associations
Statewide and regional associations that are wholly owned or controlled by Class A members or Class B members, or both, or that are wholly owned subsidiaries of a CFC member, and that do not furnish utility services but supply other forms of service to their members. Certain states have an organization that represents and serves the distribution systems and power supply systems located in the state. Such statewide organizations provide training and legislative, regulatory, media and related services. 
Class D – National Associations of Cooperatives
National associations of cooperatives that are Class A, Class B and Class C members, provided said national associations have, at the time of admission to membership in CFC, members domiciled in at least 80% of the states in the United States. National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (“NRECA”) is our sole Class D member. NRECA provides training, sponsors regional and national meetings, and provides legislative, regulatory, media and related services for nearly all rural electric cooperatives.
CFC Class A, B, C and D members are eligible to vote on matters put to a vote of the membership. 
CFC’s membership as of May 31, 2019 consisted of:

• | 842 Class A distribution systems;


• | 67 Class B power supply systems;


• | 64 Class C statewide and regional associations, including NCSC; and


• | 1 Class D national association of cooperatives.

In addition, CFC has associates that are nonprofit groups or entities organized on a cooperative basis that are owned, controlled or operated by Class A, B, C or D members and are engaged in or plan to engage in furnishing non-electric services primarily for the benefit of the ultimate consumers of CFC members. CFC had 46 associates, including RTFC, as of May 31, 2019. Associates are not eligible to vote on matters put to a vote of the membership.
NCSC
Membership in NCSC includes organizations that are Class A, B or C members of CFC, or eligible for such membership and are approved for membership by the NCSC Board of Directors. 
NCSC’s membership consisted of 441 distribution systems, two power supply systems and five statewide associations as of May 31, 2019. All of NCSC’s members also were CFC members. CFC, however, is not a member of NCSC. In addition to members, NCSC had 171 associates as of May 31, 2019. NCSC’s associates may include members of CFC, entities eligible to be members of CFC and for-profit and not-for-profit entities that are owned, controlled or operated by or provide significant benefit to Class A, B and C members of CFC.
12

RTFC
Membership in RTFC is limited to cooperative corporations, nonprofit corporations, private corporations, public corporations, utility districts and other public bodies that are approved by the RTFC Board of Directors and are actively borrowing or are eligible to borrow from RUS’s traditional infrastructure loan program. These companies must be engaged directly or indirectly in furnishing telephone services as the licensed incumbent carrier. Holding companies, subsidiaries and other organizations that are owned, controlled or operated by members are referred to as affiliates, and are eligible to borrow from RTFC. Associates are organizations that provide non-telephone or non-telecommunications services to rural telecommunications companies that are approved by the RTFC Board of Directors. Neither affiliates nor associates are eligible to vote at meetings of the members. 
RTFC’s membership consisted of 474 members as of May 31, 2019. RTFC also had six associates as of May 31, 2019. CFC is not a member of RTFC.
The business affairs of CFC, NCSC and RTFC are governed by separate boards of directors for each entity. We provide additional information on CFC’s corporate governance in “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.”

TAX STATUS

In 1969, CFC obtained a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service recognizing CFC’s exemption from the payment of federal income taxes as an organization described under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. In order for CFC to maintain its exemption under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, CFC must be “not organized for profit” and must be “operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare” within the meaning of that section of the tax code. The Internal Revenue Service determined that CFC is an organization that is “operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare” because the ultimate beneficiaries of its lending activities, like those of the RUS loan program, are the consumers of electricity produced by rural electric systems, the communities served by these systems and the nation as a whole.
As an organization described under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, no part of CFC’s net earnings can inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. This requirement is referred to as the private inurement prohibition and was added to Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code in 1996. A legislative exception allows organizations like CFC to continue to make allocations of net earnings to members in accordance with its cooperative status.
CFC believes its operations have not changed materially from those described to the Internal Revenue Service in its exemption filing. CFC reviews the impact on operations of any new activity or potential change in product offerings or business in general to determine whether such change in activity or operations would be inconsistent with its status as an organization described under Section 501(c)(4).
NCSC is a taxable cooperative that pays income tax based on its taxable income and deductions.
RTFC is a taxable cooperative under Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code and is not subject to income taxes on income from patronage sources that is allocated to its borrowers, as long as the allocation is properly noticed and at least 20% of the amount allocated is retired in cash prior to filing the applicable tax return. RTFC pays income tax based on its taxable income and deductions, excluding amounts allocated to its borrowers.

ALLOCATION AND RETIREMENT OF PATRONAGE CAPITAL

District of Columbia cooperative law requires cooperatives to allocate net earnings to patrons, to a general reserve in an amount sufficient to maintain a balance of at least 50% of paid-up capital and to a cooperative educational fund, as well as permits additional allocations to board-approved reserves. District of Columbia cooperative law also requires that a cooperative’s net earnings be allocated to all patrons in proportion to their individual patronage and each patron’s allocation be distributed to the patron unless the patron agrees that the cooperative may retain its share as additional capital.
13

CFC
Annually, the CFC Board of Directors allocates its net earnings to its patrons in the form of patronage capital, to a cooperative educational fund, to a general reserve, if necessary, and to other board-approved reserves. Net earnings are calculated by adjusting net income to exclude the noncash effects of the accounting for derivative financial instruments. Net losses, if any, are not allocated to board approved reserves or members and do not affect amounts previously allocated as patronage capital or to the reserves. Net earnings are first applied against prior-period losses, if any, before an allocation of patronage capital is made. CFC has never experienced an adjusted net loss.
An allocation to the general reserve is made, if necessary, to maintain the balance of the general reserve at 50% of the membership fees collected. CFC’s bylaws require the allocation to the cooperative educational fund to be at least 0.25% of its net earnings. Funds from the cooperative educational fund are disbursed annually to statewide cooperative organizations to fund the teaching of cooperative principles and for other cooperative education programs.
Currently, CFC has one additional board-approved reserve, the members’ capital reserve. The CFC Board of Directors determines the amount of net earnings that is allocated to the members’ capital reserve, if any. The members’ capital reserve represents net earnings that CFC holds to increase equity retention. The net earnings held in the members’ capital reserve have not been specifically allocated to members, but may be allocated to individual members in the future as patronage capital if authorized by the CFC Board of Directors.

All remaining net earnings are allocated to CFC’s members in the form of patronage capital. The amount of net earnings allocated to each member is based on the member’s patronage of CFC’s lending programs during the year. No interest is earned by members on allocated patronage capital. There is no effect on CFC’s total equity as a result of allocating net earnings to members in the form of patronage capital or to board-approved reserves. The CFC Board of Directors has voted annually on whether or not to retire a portion of the patronage capital allocation. Upon retirement, patronage capital is paid out in cash to the members to which it was allocated. CFC’s total equity is reduced by the amount of patronage capital retired to its members and by amounts disbursed from board-approved reserves.

Pursuant to CFC’s bylaws, the CFC Board of Directors determines the method, basis, priority and order of retirement of amounts allocated. The current policy of the CFC Board of Directors is to retire 50% of the prior fiscal year’s allocated net earnings following the end of each fiscal year and to hold the remaining 50% for 25 years to fund operations. The amount and timing of future retirements remains subject to annual approval by the CFC Board of Directors, and may be affected by CFC’s financial condition and other factors. The CFC Board of Directors has the authority to change the current practice for allocating and retiring net earnings at any time, subject to applicable cooperative law.
NCSC
In accordance with District of Columbia cooperative law and its bylaws and board policies, NCSC allocates its net earnings to a cooperative educational fund, to a general reserve, if necessary, and to other board-approved reserves. Net earnings are calculated by adjusting net income to exclude the noncash effects of the accounting for derivative financial instruments. Net losses, if any, are not allocated to board-approved reserves and do not affect amounts previously allocated to the reserves. 
Pursuant to NCSC’s bylaws, the NCSC Board of Directors shall determine the method, basis, priority and order of amounts allocated. An allocation to the general reserve is made, if necessary, to maintain the balance of the general reserve at 50% of the membership fees collected. There is no effect on NCSC's total equity due to the allocation of net earnings to board-approved reserves. NCSC’s bylaws require the allocation to the cooperative educational fund to be at least 0.25% of its net earnings. Funds from the cooperative educational fund are disbursed annually to fund the teaching of cooperative principles and for other cooperative education programs.
RTFC
In accordance with District of Columbia cooperative law and its bylaws and board policies, RTFC allocates its net earnings to its patrons, a cooperative educational fund and a general reserve, if necessary. Net losses are not allocated to members and do not affect amounts previously allocated as patronage capital or to the reserves. Current period earnings are first applied against any prior year losses before allocating patronage capital. 
14

Pursuant to RTFC’s bylaws, the RTFC Board of Directors shall determine the method, basis, priority and order of retirement of amounts allocated. RTFC’s bylaws require that it allocate at least 1% of net earnings to a cooperative educational fund. Funds from the cooperative educational fund are disbursed annually to fund the teaching of cooperative principles and for other cooperative education programs. An allocation to the general reserve is made, if necessary, to maintain the balance of the general reserve at 50% of the membership fees collected. The remainder is allocated to borrowers in proportion to their patronage. RTFC provides notice to its members of the amount allocated and retires 20% of the allocation for that year in cash prior to the filing of the applicable tax return. Any additional amounts are retired as determined by the RTFC Board of Directors with due regard for RTFC’s financial condition. There is no effect on RTFC's total equity due to the allocation of net earnings to members or board-approved reserves. The retirement of amounts previously allocated to members or amounts disbursed from board-approved reserves reduces RTFC's total equity.
