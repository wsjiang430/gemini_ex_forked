Overview
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing viral immunotherapies to help patients fight cancer. Our engineered viruses are designed to induce a systemic anti-tumor response due to immunogenic cell death through direct viral-mediated cytotoxicity in cancer cells, thus releasing tumor neo-antigens and creating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. Our viral immunotherapy approach utilizes intratumoral administration of genetically engineered viruses to induce tumor cell death and elicit a systemic anti-tumor response. Local delivery enables us to achieve these effects while aiming to minimize systemic toxicity. The immune cells induced by these viral immunotherapies are believed to target patients’ specific tumor antigens, potentially improving responses in immunologically “hot” tumors while at the same time infiltrating the tumor microenvironment, transforming non-inflamed “cold” tumors with limited immune response into “hot” tumors. While our product candidates are administered directly into the tumor, we have observed a systemic immune response in our preclinical studies and clinical trials that may indicate the potential of our product candidates to induce a systemic immune response against distal, uninjected tumors, also known as an “abscopal” effect.
We believe viral immunotherapy is among the most promising cancer treatment modalities today. Our goal is to further improve patient outcomes through viral immunotherapies by selecting the optimal vector, specific transgenes and clinical indications for each tumor type while optimizing product candidate attributes, such as high-titer formulation, intratumoral administration to induce systemic anti-tumor immunity, and storage conditions that could potentially lower logistical barriers for patients and clinicians.
We have established two clinical stage viral immunotherapy platforms based on novel, genetically modified adenovirus and herpes simplex virus (HSV) constructs, respectively.
 Our most advanced product candidate, CAN-2409, is an off-the-shelf adenovirus product candidate which is combined with the prodrug, valacyclovir, that has generated promising clinical activity across a range of solid tumor indications. CAN-2409 is currently being studied in the following ongoing clinical trials:
 •Prostate Cancer
 oa Phase 3 randomized, triple-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical trial in the United States under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA), with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluating 711 patients with newly diagnosed, localized prostate cancer who have an intermediate or high-risk for progression. We completed enrollment of this trial in September 2021 and we expect to present topline data at the end of 2024.
 oa Phase 2 randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in the United States evaluating 187 patients with low-to-intermediate risk localized prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance. We completed enrollment of this trial in May 2019 and we expect topline data from this clinical trial to be available in the fourth quarter of 2024.
 •Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) – an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial in the United States evaluating CAN-2409 plus valacyclovir in combination with continued PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors in 80 patients with stage III/IV NSCLC who have inadequate response to PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors. We reported initial data from this trial at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2022 and an update during our Research and Development Day in December 2022, demonstrating the following:
 oEvidence of local and systemic anti-tumor activity 
 oDisease control rate of 77% (20/26) in patients entering trial with disease progression (cohort 2)
 oSustained and ongoing clinical responses greater than 1 year
 oFavorable change in trajectory of tumor progression 
 oDecreased tumor size of RECIST target lesions in most patients
 oReduced uninjected tumor size in 14/21 patients (67%)
 oOverall response rate of 13% (4/30) across cohorts 1 and 2
 oDurable disease stabilization translating into encouraging preliminary evidence of progression-free survival
 oConsistent induction of local and systemic cytotoxic T cell response 
 oIncreased infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment
 oSystemic expansion of effector T cells and increase in soluble granzyme B levels in peripheral blood 
 oFavorable safety/tolerability data with most treatment-related adverse events being grade 1/2


We anticipate presenting additional updated clinical data from this ongoing clinical trial in the third quarter of 2023.
 •Pancreatic Cancer – we have initiated a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial in the United States evaluating CAN-2409 in borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In March 2023, in connection with our cost management and dynamic portfolio management initiatives, we paused new enrollment in this randomized Phase 2 clinical trial, subject to additional funding. Despite the pause in patient enrollment, we continue to expect to present initial clinical data in the fourth quarter of 2023. In a previous Phase 1b trial, patients with pancreatic cancer treated with CAN-2409 in addition to standard of care demonstrated a greater survival duration over the expected survival of the patients treated with the existing standard of care alone in a comparison to historical trial results. Furthermore, in the group of patients where pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies were available, a statistically significant increase in the number of CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes was observed. 
 Our lead HSV-based product candidate, CAN-3110, is currently in an ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial in our initial target indication of recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG). These patients have failed standard of care treatment and have a poor prognosis. Initial clinical data from this trial was presented in an oral presentation at the ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2021, and additional biomarker data was reported in November 2021. During our Research and Development Day in December 2022, we presented updated data demonstrating that CAN-3110 was well tolerated with no observed dose-limiting toxicity, achieved 11.6 months mOS with a single dose, and showed evidence of persistent HSV-1 antigen and HSV-1 replication consistent with mechanism of action​ as well as robust evidence of immune activation​.
 We are currently evaluating the effects of multiple doses of CAN-3110 in recurrent HGG supported by the Break Through Cancer foundation.
 We are also designing other novel viral immunotherapy candidates using our proprietary enLIGHTEN Discovery Platform, the first systematic, iterative HSV-based discovery platform leveraging human biology and advanced analytics to create new viral immunotherapy candidates for solid tumors. In October 2022, we entered into a collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) Center for Cellular Immunotherapies to study the impact of novel viral immunotherapy candidates based on Candel’s enLIGHTEN Discovery Platform to strengthen the activity of UPenn’s investigational CAR-T cell therapies in difficult to treat solid tumors.
 We currently own development and commercialization rights for our programs in major markets, including the United States, Europe and Asia, allowing us to control development and seek approval in those areas as we prepare our commercialization efforts.
We were incorporated in Delaware in June 2003 as Advantagene, Inc. (Advantagene). In December 2019, Advantagene licensed substantially all the assets of Periphagen, a company focused on engineering HSV as a gene therapy vector, and in September 2020, licensed CAN-3110 from Mass General Brigham (MGB). In December 2020, we formally changed our name from Advantagene to Candel Therapeutics, Inc. We completed our initial public offering in July 2021.
 Our Strategy
Our goal is to develop best-in-class viral immunotherapies to transform the lives of cancer patients. We plan to develop and commercialize our two lead product candidates, CAN-2409 and CAN-3110, for the treatment of a broad range of solid tumor indications, while continuing to build our pipeline through our discovery platform. Key elements of our strategy include the following:
▪Advance the late-stage development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our lead product candidate, CAN-2409, in newly diagnosed, localized prostate cancer. We are currently conducting a potentially registrational Phase 3 clinical trial in intermediate- and high-risk patients in combination with the standard of care, radiotherapy. If approved, we believe CAN-2409 could be a first-in-class drug for localized prostate cancer patients with the potential to reduce disease progression and recurrence. 
 ▪Advance the clinical development of CAN-3110 from our HSV platform with tumor-specific enhanced replication potency. An investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial is ongoing in recurrent HGG. This trial is evaluating the activity of CAN-3110 in therapy-resistant disease, where we believe a replicating virus may present therapeutic advantages. 
 ▪Advance the development of CAN-2409 in stage III/IV NSCLC patients with inadequate responses to standard of care immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). A Phase 2 trial that evaluates CAN-2409 in combination with ICI is currently underway in NSCLC.
 ▪Continue to expand the development of CAN-2409 in other solid tumor indications, such as pancreatic cancer. We believe we can leverage our broad clinical experience to expand the development of CAN-2409 


in other indications. We have initiated a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, in March 2023, in connection with our cost management and dynamic portfolio management initiatives, we elected to pause new enrollment in this randomized Phase 2 clinical trial, subject to additional funding.
▪Leverage our HSV viral immunotherapy platform to develop additional HSV-based product candidates. Our new enLIGHTEN Discovery Platform enables rapid vector engineering to generate a range of new candidates in a data driven and indication specific manner. We utilize a key attribute of HSV, a high capacity for genetic cargo, to seek to enable targeted modifications and deploy indication specific genes to the tumor microenvironment. Our platform is designed to generate both replication-defective and replication-competent agents depending on the demands of a particular application. 
 ▪Establish strategic partnerships to maximize the value of our current and future product candidates. In order to advance treatment options for a large number of patients, we may partner with other companies with complementary resources to maximize the value of our current and future product candidates. Such partnerships may allow us to pair CAN-2409, CAN-3110 and our future product candidates with other novel agents owned by strategic partners. Partnerships may also help realize the full potential of our product candidates in markets where we are unlikely to pursue development or commercialization on our own. We intend to maintain significant economic interest in our product candidates and selectively consider partnership opportunities. 
 ▪Ensure commercial-scale manufacturing of our product candidates. We will rely on third party contract manufacturers for commercial-scale manufacturing of our adenovirus product candidate, CAN-2409. We expect that our cost-of-goods will be substantially lower than cell- and antibody-based therapies because of our high-yield manufacturing process.
 Our Approach
Conventional cancer therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery) often do not eradicate 100% of the tumor cells, which often leads to tumor progression or recurrence. Deep and durable responses, therefore, are still elusive for many cancer patients. Traditionally, surgery and/or radiotherapy are used for local tumor debulking, whereas chemotherapeutic agents target systemic eradication of tumor cells. These treatment modalities, however, are often limited by toxicity.
Immunotherapy is a relatively new treatment modality that has expanded the anti-cancer treatment paradigm. FDA-approved immunotherapies include cytokines, cell therapies and antibodies, including ICIs. Much focus has been placed on harnessing the effector T cell arm of the immune system for tumor specific immunity. Adoptive T cell therapy has shown positive results but with limited activity in solid tumors, and is not scalable for widespread use. Vaccine approaches range in complexity from peptide antigens to autologous or allogeneic tumor cell products. The advantage of the single antigen approaches is that they can be easily manufactured and produced, however, they have the fundamental disadvantage of being potentially irrelevant for a patient’s specific tumor or immune system or easily bypassed by resistant clones. Cellular vaccines are not easily scalable and allogeneic vaccines may not bear the relevant antigens expressed by a patient’s tumor. ICIs such as anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, have transformed the treatment paradigm for different cancer indications. However, only approximately 15% to 40% of overall patients respond to such treatment.
We are focused on the development of viral immunotherapy approaches, which are based on an extensive history of research. Originally, the mechanism of action of those agents was believed to be based only on the ability of the virus to induce cancer cell lysis and to resolve tumors. Later, it was demonstrated that viral immunotherapy may induce immunogenic cell death. This effect may be enhanced by the pro-inflammatory effects of the viral capsid proteins. With the dramatic emergence of ICIs and immunotherapy as a core treatment modality, the importance of the immunostimulatory aspect of viral-mediated approaches became more widely evident. The currently understood generalized mechanism of action of viral immunotherapies is unique in combining both an anti-tumor cytotoxic component and an immune-stimulatory component. Together, these modalities lead to an “in-situ vaccination” effect against the injected tumor followed by an effect on uninjected distant metastases.
Pairing this therapeutic approach with ICI treatment or with radiotherapy is based on a strong mechanistic rationale and has shown promise in experimental models of cancer. It has been observed that tumors that are least responsive to ICI are commonly characterized by low levels of lymphocytic infiltration and low or no PD-L1 expression levels; they are referred to as “cold” tumors. One of our areas of focus is the conversion of immunologically suppressed “cold” tumors into immunologically active “hot” tumors, thereby increasing their responsiveness to ICI or other therapies, such as radiotherapy.
The Mechanism of Action of Viral Immunotherapy:
•Direct anti-tumor cytotoxic activity. Tumor-specific viral-mediated oncolysis is achieved by both precise delivery of the engineered virus to the tumor as well as the virus’ ability to selectively replicate within a cancer cell. Various approaches have been applied in different programs to increase the specificity and potency of viral toxicity aimed at tumor cells, including genetic modifications and use of prodrugs. 
 •Broad stimulation of anti-tumor immunity. The immunogenic cell death driven by oncolysis results in a potent local and systemic immune stimulation with the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. This, in turn, promotes the activation of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system in the presence of highly immunogenic viral components. This broad response commonly includes recruitment and activation of antigen-presenting cells and effector immune cells to the site of the tumor. 
 •Priming of the immune system against tumor antigens. The lysis of cancer cells leads to the exposure of tumor-specific antigens. This early effect, combined with intratumoral immune cell infiltration and activation, leads to antigen presentation and initiation of a local adaptive immune response targeted against a set of tumor antigens expressed by the patient’s cancer cells. 
 •Development of a systemic immune memory response. Viral immunotherapy induces the development of a long-lasting systemic immune surveillance against the antigens associated with the injected tumor, and consequently, tumor antigens expressed at metastatic sites. This leads to a cytotoxic immune response against the distant tumor cells, also known as an abscopal effect. 
 Desirable Clinical Properties. Viral immunotherapy has attributes that are important for a cancer therapeutic. The agents are off-the-shelf, and while they have been shown to stimulate immune responses in most patients, there is no requirement to modify them for each patient, unlike other cellular therapy approaches. The first viral immunotherapy was approved by the FDA in 2015, providing support that additional agents in this class may have similar potential. Furthermore, safety data shown in several clinical trials of various immunotherapies supports the ability to combine viral immunotherapy with other agents due to the potential for fewer overlapping side effects.
Our Immunotherapy Platforms. Our two platforms, one based on adenovirus and the other based on HSV, provide different and complementary sets of attributes, which allows us to utilize the product candidate that is best suited for a particular clinical application.
Key attributes across our viral immunotherapy platforms include:
▪Targeting a Wide Range of Cell Types. Product candidates from both the HSV and adenoviral platforms can transduce a diverse range of cell types, which we believe will allow us to address many different forms of cancer. 
 ▪Off-the-Shelf Product. A standardized product intended to be available as needed via prescription supports straightforward clinical administration, simplified manufacturing and supply chain management. 
 ▪Intratumoral Route of Administration. Both of our product candidates are administered by direct injection into the tumor site. This aims to maximize immune stimulation and minimize systemic toxicity, factors that are believed to be suboptimal with intravenous administration. We believe that directly injecting these viral immunotherapies into a patient’s cancerous tissue helps to optimize the benefit/risk for these agents to be highly immunostimulatory at the site of the tumor, whereas systemically administered agents would need to avoid detection by the body’s immune surveillance mechanisms to avoid rapid destruction before getting to the target tumor. While our product candidates are administered directly into the tumor, we have observed a systemic immune response in our preclinical studies and clinical trials that may indicate the potential of our product candidates to induce systemic immune response against distal, uninjected tumors, also known as an “abscopal” effect. For the indications that we selected, intratumoral administration is a straightforward procedure that is aligned with clinical practice, leveraging standard of care medical procedures, such as intra-prostate injection or delivery during diagnostic (bronchoscopy) or therapeutic (neurosurgery) procedures. 
 ▪Cost-efficient Manufacturing. Both product candidates are relatively inexpensive to manufacture, particularly when compared to other biologic or cellular therapy treatments. 
 Key attributes of our Adenoviral platform include:
▪Targeting a Wide Range of Cell Types. Adenoviruses can efficiently transduce cells from different lineages. This allows us to apply this platform to many different tumor types. 
 ▪Immunogenic Virus Particle. The adenoviral virus particles are strong simulators of the innate immune system, a property that contributes to immune activation at the site of administration. 


▪High-Titer Formulation. Adenovirus can be formulated at high titers, facilitating the administration of low volume doses sufficiently potent to induce strong activity. 
 ▪Product Stability. The formulation deployed in clinical trials has stability at refrigerator temperatures (4°C), supporting use at less specialized and therefore widely accessible sites such as community-based private clinics. 
 ▪Non-Replicating Design. Engineering the adenovirus to remove replication ability reduces the potential for viral shedding, something which is particularly important in clinical applications such as prostate cancer. There is no need for in vivo amplification as the virus is highly immunogenic and can be administered at high titers. 
 Key attributes of our CAN-3110 platform include:
▪Capacity for selective replication in the tumor. There is a strong rationale for use of a replication-competent virus that is designed to provide potent oncolysis and viral amplification in tumors characterized by high volume or located in less anatomically accessible areas, such as recurrent HGG. We have engineered CAN-3110 to selectively replicate only within tumors. This tumor specific replication ability of CAN-3110 is regulated by the expression of ICP34.5, a gene encoding for a protein that permits viral replication even in the presence of the interferon response that is normally able to quell viral infection. In the CAN-3110 construct, ICP34.5 expression is driven by the expression of Nestin, a protein largely expressed in certain tumors, like gliomas, but not in healthy brain tissue, thereby enabling replication specifically in the context of brain tumors. We believe our HSV-based platform will allow us to implement additional genetic modifications to leverage the use of CAN-3110 in recurrent HGG and in other tumor types expressing Nestin. 
 ▪Oncolytic activity combined with immunostimulatory properties. CAN-3110 is designed to persist and replicate at the site of the tumor. Viral replication is accompanied by tumor oncolysis, with release of tumor antigens in the microenvironment and activation of local systemic immune response. 
 Key attributes of the enLIGHTEN Discovery Platform include:
▪Strong focus on human biology, including deep phenotyping of human tumors, to increase probability of success
 ▪Data driven selection of the payload. The use of advanced analytics on proprietary and publicly available datasets enables us to select what we believe is the best payload for combinatory strategy in a specific indication, rationalizing our payload selection, de-risking development and maximizing our probability of success. 
 ▪Use of HSV based on its high capacity for genetic cargos. Our HSV-based platform allows the introduction of large genetic cargos, such as multiple immunomodulatory genes that may further enhance the anti-tumor immune response. 
 ▪Amenable to engineered modifications. Our knowledge of virus biology allows us to make modifications, such as those already present in CAN-3110 to target certain tumor types. Leveraging these modifications, we can select the best viral vector to deliver the selected payload in a specific indication. 
 Our Pipeline
We have an advanced pipeline of late-stage and early-stage clinical trials with our two lead product candidates, CAN-2409 and CAN-3110.



CAN-2409, formerly known as gene mediated cytotoxic immunotherapy (GMCI), is our most advanced product candidate. It is a replication defective adenovirus that has been genetically modified to express the gene encoding the HSV-thymidine kinase enzyme. This enzyme activates the prodrug, valacyclovir, a widely available, generally well-tolerated antiviral at the site of the tumor, generating a powerful patient-specific anti-tumor immune response. We believe there are three key aspects of the mechanism of action. First, the direct, cellular killing activity is based on the transformation of valacyclovir into a toxic nucleotide analogue that disrupts DNA synthesis and repair. This phenomenon occurs preferentially in actively dividing cancer cells, thereby providing tumor specificity. This DNA repair inhibition is also hypothesized to be the mechanistic explanation behind the encouraging pre-clinical and clinical activity of CAN-2409 in combination with radiotherapy, a treatment known to cause DNA breaks requiring repair for continued cellular survival. Second, adenoviral capsid proteins themselves also directly trigger an immuno-inflammatory response through the establishment of a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment, resulting in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules that contribute to the optimal conditions to immunize against the tumor antigens that are released in the tumor microenvironment as a direct result of the formed toxic nucleotide analogues. Together, this results in the recruitment, activation and proliferation of anti-tumor effector cells, in particular CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Consequently, the localized death of tumor cells releases numerous antigens that can be recognized by the patient’s own immune system, thereby training the immune system to recognize, target and destroy cancer cells bearing the same antigens that have spread to other sites in the body.
To date, CAN-2409 has been administered to over 950 patients with cancer, who are in ongoing, placebo-controlled randomized trials. In total, we have conducted more than 10 clinical trials with CAN-2409 in a range of solid tumor indications. We have seen encouraging clinical activity and a favorable tolerability profile with CAN-2409 in both monotherapy and combination settings with radiotherapy, ICI therapy, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), chemotherapy and surgery. Based on the totality of our clinical data generated to date, we are currently pursuing indications in lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancer, which we believe all have great potential to address unmet need.
 We are conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial with CAN-2409 under agreement with the FDA through the SPA process in newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer in intermediate- and certain high-risk patients in combination with the standard of care that comprises radiotherapy and optional ADT. Our SPA provides FDA concurrence that our key endpoints and specific critical elements of our trial design are adequate to support a future marketing application if, among other things, we achieve the primary endpoint in the trial. The clinical trial is randomized, triple-blinded and placebo-controlled. It targeted enrollment of approximately 700 patients and was fully enrolled with 711 patients in September 2021 with topline data anticipated at the end of 2024. We have also received fast track designation by the FDA for the development of CAN-2409 for the treatment of localized, primary prostate cancer in combination with radiotherapy to improve the local control rate, decrease recurrence and improve disease-free survival. We expect that if the trial is successful and if we obtain FDA approval, CAN-2409 could be the first new FDA approved pharmacologic treatment available in over 30 years as a first-line therapeutic for the over 100,000 patients who are newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer each year in the United States.
We have also completed enrollment for a Phase 2 clinical trial with CAN-2409 as monotherapy in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients under active surveillance. This trial has recruited 187 patients with low-, intermediate- and certain high-risk localized prostate cancer. We expect to announce topline data in the fourth quarter of 2024. We believe that this trial, if successful, could position CAN-2409 as a first-line monotherapy treatment for patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer, thereby meaningfully expanding the addressable patient population.

In NSCLC, we have observed monotherapy activity of CAN-2409 in a Phase 1 biomarker focused, window of opportunity clinical trial. In 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating CAN-2409 in combination with PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with inadequate response to PD-(L)1 ICI. This open label trial, as amended, is targeting enrollment of approximately 80 patients with stage III/IV NSCLC in two separate cohorts. The cohorts are defined based on response to ICI at the time of enrollment. Cohort 1 addresses patients with stable disease at enrollment. Cohort 2 enrolls patients with progressive disease after at least 18 weeks of ICI treatment. Patients will continue treatment with their initial checkpoint inhibitor and CAN-2409 will be added to their regimen. The primary efficacy endpoint for this trial is tumor response as measured by RECIST criteria including overall response rate (ORR) and/or disease control rate (DCR). We reported initial data from this trial at the ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2022 and during our Research and Development Day in December 2022, we presented updated data showing evidence of local and systemic anti-tumor activity; a DCR of 77% (20/26) in patients entering the trial with disease progression (cohort 2); sustained and ongoing clinical responses greater than 1 year; favorable change in the trajectory of tumor progression; decreased tumor size of RECIST target lesions in most patients; reduced uninjected tumor size in 14/21 patients (67%); an overall response rate of 13% (4/30) across cohorts 1 and 2; durable disease stabilization translating into encouraging preliminary evidence of progression-free survival; consistent induction of local and systemic cytotoxic T cell response; increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment; systemic expansion of effector T cells and increase in soluble granzyme B levels in the peripheral blood; and a favorable safety/tolerability data with most treatment-related adverse events being grade 1/2. We anticipate presenting additional updated data from this ongoing clinical trial in the third quarter of 2023.
We have initiated a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating CAN-2409 in borderline-resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In March 2023, in connection with our cost management and dynamic portfolio management initiatives, we elected to pause new enrollment in this randomized Phase 2 clinical trial, subject to additional funding. Despite the pause in patient enrollment, we continue to expect to present initial clinical data in the fourth quarter of 2023. In a previous Phase 1b trial, patients with pancreatic cancer treated with CAN-2409 in addition to standard of care demonstrated a greater survival duration over the expected survival of the patients treated with the existing standard of care alone in a comparison to historical trial results. Furthermore, in the group of patients where pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies were available, a statistically significant increase in the number of CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes was observed.
 Our second viral immunotherapy platform is based on a novel, next generation, genetically modified HSV that induces tumor specific oncolysis. The HSV-based platform enables generation of both replication-competent and replication-defective viral product candidates as well as capacity to clone, in the vector, up to five transgenes that will allow us to optimize our virus profile for different tumor settings. CAN-3110, our first HSV-based product candidate, has been engineered for enhanced specificity and tumor cell killing, while minimizing toxicity on healthy tissue. CAN-3110 was formerly known as rQNestin34.5v.2. An investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial is ongoing with CAN-3110 in our initial target indication of recurrent HGG and we reported additional biomarker results in November 2021. During our Research and Development Day in December 2022, we presented updated data demonstrating that the treatment was well tolerated, with no observed dose-limiting toxicity; produced a median overall survival (mOS) of 11.6 months with a single dose; showed evidence of immune activation​ and persistent HSV-1 antigen and HSV-1 replication consistent with the mechanism of action. We are currently evaluating the effects of multiple doses of CAN-3110 in recurrent HGG supported by the Break Through Cancer foundation. Based on the molecular targeting of CAN-3110, we believe that it could be evaluated in an expanded range of indications in the future, such as other neurologic tumors, melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, thyroid tumors and breast cancer.
In addition, we are pursuing novel discovery programs based on our enLIGHTEN Discovery Platform.
Market Opportunity
 The four indications where we have the most advanced clinical trials are localized prostate cancer, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, and recurrent HGG. These types of cancer present substantial market opportunities and are also enabling indications for future expansion into other solid tumors.
Localized Prostate Cancer
 Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men in the United States, representing a high level of medical burden and unmet need. The prostate cancer therapy market is estimated to grow to over $16.1 billion by 2026. Approximately 200,000 men in the United States are diagnosed with prostate cancer annually, with more than 30,000 deaths each year. Although most deaths occur in patients with later stage metastatic disease, most prostate cancer patients roughly 150,000 annually in the United States are initially diagnosed in the early stage of disease, of which roughly 105,000 are considered to have intermediate- or high-risk of progression and approximately 45,000 are considered to be low-risk.
For the intermediate- and high-risk patients, the standard of care is radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy often in conjunction with androgen deprivation therapy or chemical castration. These treatments have a high incidence of

potentially life altering side effects, including incontinence and erectile dysfunction. There is therefore a significant unmet need for a novel treatment able to forestall or prevent progression to later stages of disease without the burdensome side effects associated with the current standard of care. Weighing the balance between therapeutic efficacy and side effects linked to therapy, about 10% of the intermediate-risk patients, and approximately 40% of the low-risk patients decide, in consultation with their physicians, to adopt a close monitoring approach known as active surveillance that involves periodic imaging, biomarker evaluation and biopsies. Standard of care in this early, localized setting, leaves substantial need unaddressed.
 As a result of PSA screening programs, most patients are diagnosed at early stages of disease with low grade, low volume, asymptomatic prostate cancer. Current screening methods are inadequate to definitively identify which patients are most likely to progress. As a result of these side effects, there is a large desire to delay or prevent the need for radical treatment. As a result, many men with prostate cancer meeting the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for low-risk prostate cancer choose not to be treated and to undergo an intense monitoring program, known as Active Surveillance (AS), as their preferred initial course of treatment. However, within 10 years of diagnosis, between 21% and 38% of men will have developed progressive cancer and require invasive treatments. It has been reported that 21% and 41% of patients initially under AS convert to active treatment based on progression of their disease within two and five years, and approximately 17% of men undergoing AS choose to move to active treatments within 10 years of diagnosis, even in the absence of any evidence of progression, underscoring the level of concern around progression and the significant unmet need in this early line of treatment.
To our knowledge, the only FDA-approved pharmacologic intervention indicated for newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer is chemical castration therapy, also known as ADT. Standard of care for localized disease is primarily surgery, radiotherapy and/or ADT. Because ADT has a potentially severe side effect profile, including impotence, hot flashes, mood changes, depression and others, these hormone treatments are reserved only for those patients that present the highest risk of localized or metastatic prostate cancer. Similarly, surgical prostatectomy can often cause urinary dysfunction and sexual dysfunction that can last years and sometimes be permanent. Approximately one-third of men with normal baseline function will report some increase in urinary symptoms and urgency after prostatectomy and most men will experience some erectile dysfunction after treatment with either surgery or radiation.
We believe CAN-2409 provides a significant commercial opportunity for therapeutic use in the newly diagnosed, localized prostate cancer patient population, with the goal of reducing progression or recurrence of disease without significant toxicities and with a product that can be administered at outpatient facilities.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
 In recent years ICI, specifically PD-1 directed agents, have transformed the treatment paradigm of NSCLC and become a backbone therapy for this indication. Over a half dozen ICI products have been approved in various cancer indications, and there are numerous other related drug candidates in preclinical and clinical development. Global sales for ICIs in 2019 were approximately $23 billion with NSCLC accounting for 50% to 55% of overall sales. The commercial opportunity in NSCLC is significant. Drug treated patient populations in the US for 2020 are estimated at 75,160; 47,920 and 21,990 in first-, second- and third-line treatment, respectively. ICI use in NSCLC has become standard of care with approximately 49% of first-line patients in the United States being treated with an ICI alone or in combination with other agents. Nonetheless, 60% of these patients will have an inadequate response after one year of ICI treatment, and 80% after three years.
Pancreatic Cancer
 The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 64,050 people in the United States (33,130 men and 30,920 women) will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2023; about 50,550 people (26,620 men and 23,930 women) will die of pancreatic cancer this year. Treatment is with surgery in cases where tumors are resectable, followed by adjuvant chemoradiation; there is increasing use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in borderline resectable or even resectable disease in order to better reduce the risk of recurrence. For resected patients, while surgery and adjuvant approaches (e.g. FOLFORINOX) have improved median overall survival, 5 year survival rates remain modest (20-30%) and most tumors will recur (median recurrence free survival ~1.5 years). While there is a high level of total clinical research and development activity across pancreatic cancer settings (over 150 investigational products in Phase 2 or later development), the majority are targeting metastatic disease. Physicians have identified a continued unmet need for more effective treatment options across the pancreatic cancer setting, including a need for further approaches which can increase the resectability of borderline / locally advanced patients, and improving cure rates in resected patients. There are an estimated 18,510 patients with resectable disease, with a sizeable proportion receiving surgery and adjuvant therapy; there are 12,340 patients with borderline resectable disease and 30,850 with locally advanced tumors (with the majority undergoing neoadjuvant / induction treatment) in the US/EU5.
High-Grade Glioma

Glioblastoma, the most common form of HGG, is a relatively rare cancer with first-line drug treated prevalent population in the United States of approximately 16,113 patients. Treatment in the upfront setting is surgical resection, if possible, coupled with temozolomide and/or radiotherapy; however, virtually all patients eventually develop recurrent disease.
The prognosis for glioblastoma that has recurred is dire; median overall survival with second line chemotherapy such as lomustine is associated with median overall survival of 6-9 months. Few pharmaceutical treatment options exist for patients with recurrent HGG, with the last significant FDA approval over a decade ago. Avastin was approved in 2009, specifically for patients with recurrent glioblastoma, and approval was granted despite the absence of a survival benefit in the registrational studies. New agents to treat patients with recurrent HGG are urgently needed.
 Our Product Candidates
Lead Product Candidate - CAN-2409
We believe the adenovirus-based CAN-2409 has advantageous properties that differentiate from other viral immunotherapies. Namely, CAN-2409:
▪Has consistently shown activity in clinical trials across a range of solid tumor types. 
 ▪Has been dosed in hundreds of patients and has generated favorable tolerability and safety data.
▪Is engineered to be potently immunogenic but non-replicating with the goal of maximizing the anti-tumor immune response while minimizing the risk for local and systemic toxicity.
▪Can be stored at 4°C, facilitating the use of CAN-2409 in out-patient clinics. This aspect is particularly favorable in indications such as prostate cancer, where patients are often monitored in individual private practices. 
 CAN-2409 (international non-proprietary name: aglatimagene besadenovec) is an adenovirus-based replication-defective engineered gene construct encoding the thymidine kinase gene derived from the herpes simplex virus. It is injected directly into the tumor or target tissue. Localized injection is intended to minimize systemic toxicities associated with systemic intravenous administration, eliminating the requirement for complex immune evasion or tumor-specific targeting mechanisms, and focuses the immune response locally against the tumor, while also activating the desired systemic anti-tumoral response against the injected tumor and uninjected metastases. The adenoviral vector is used to transport the thymidine kinase gene into the tumor cells at the site of injection. HSV-thymidine kinase converts generic, FDA-approved anti-herpes drugs, such as ganciclovir, acyclovir and valacyclovir, which we use as prodrugs, into a toxic nucleotide analogue. These agents are widely available, inexpensive and are generally well-tolerated. Cells transduced with the thymidine kinase gene as well as neighboring cells that are replicating or exhibit DNA damage undergo immunogenic cell death after exposure to these systemically administered prodrugs that are converted in the tumor microenvironment into toxic metabolites.
The prodrug-derived cytotoxic nucleotide analogs are designed to inhibit DNA replication and repair, leading to the death of multiplying tumor cells, and in particular of cells undergoing repair from radiation or chemotherapy damage. This form of cell death is immunogenic and exposes tumor antigens that can elicit a further tumor-specific immune response. Additionally, the virus itself stimulates a marked immuno-inflammatory response. Key pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokines, adhesion molecules and costimulatory molecules are locally upregulated, resulting in an inflamed (hot) tumor microenvironment, able to further enhance CD8+ cytotoxic T cell activation and immunization against released tumor antigens.
This local effect provides a strong mechanistic rationale for the combination of viral immunotherapy with ICIs such as PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting antibodies. ICI agents work by unmasking the inhibitory signals provided by PD-L1 ligands on tumor cells when bound to PD-1 receptors on T cells. By blocking this suppressive signal pharmacologically, it has been demonstrated that T cells can be unleashed to attack cancer cells and that profound clinical benefit can be achieved, but this benefits only a minority of patients. It has been hypothesized that treatment results can be significantly improved by optimizing recognition of the specific tumor antigens by the patient’s adaptive immune system using viral immunotherapy combined with the non-specific stimulation of T cells induced by ICI treatment. It appears that a duality of signals is required: releasing the checkpoint inhibition as described earlier, coupled with the provision of a positive, stimulatory signal to T cells. The efficient presentation of tumor specific antigens by MHC class I molecules to the immune system provides just such a specific, stimulatory signal. Viral immunotherapies have been shown to facilitate such cross presentation of tumor antigens and are therefore an attractive complement to PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint blockade.
The immune system is highly dynamic, with continuous trafficking of different populations of immune cells throughout the body. One outcome of this is that when T cells are locally activated and trained to recognize tumor-specific antigens, they can act systemically to drive an efficient immune response at sites distant from the original tumor. This abscopal effect may explain the significant effects observed at distant, uninjected sites demonstrated in experimental models of cancers. Abscopal effect has been shown with CAN-2409 in a mouse model of prostate cancer. The model employed

RM-1, a syngeneic prostate cell line, that was implanted both in the flanks of the mice as well as systemic, via a tail vein injection to mimic metastatic disease, resulting in the emergence of lung tumor nodules. After intratumor treatment of the flank tumor masses with either CAN-2409 and systemic prodrug, alone or in combination with radiotherapy, we observed a beneficial response in both injected and uninjected metastatic tumor. Use of CAN-2409 resulted in a 38% mean reduction in tumor volume and, in the combination arm, a reduction of 61% in tumor volume. Notably, the average number of lung nodules was reduced from 20.5 in the control arm and 22.4 in the mice that received radiotherapy to 13.0 in the CAN-2409 arm, and to 6.6 when CAN-2409 was combined with radiotherapy. We have also observed the abscopal response in connection with the experimental treatment of CAN-2409 in patients with NSCLC.
 The activity of CAN-2409 treatment has been shown to be dependent on CD8+ T cell involvement in studies in mouse models that evaluated permutations of CAN-2409 treatment and T cell depletion. Furthermore, T cells from mice that were successfully treated with CAN-2409 and prodrug were shown to be sufficient to inhibit tumor growth when mixed with AKR tumor model cells and implanted subcutaneously in mouse flanks. This activity was not observed with T cells from untreated mice, from mice that were treated with a control vector that lacked the thymidine kinase gene, or when the AKR tumor cells were xenografted alone. These data are consistent with a T cell dependent mechanism of action of CAN-2409. Additionally, we have shown the induction of CD8+ T cell infiltration at the site of the tumor in patients with prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and NSCLC.
 Second Product Candidate - CAN-3110
 CAN-3110 is a modified HSV with specific properties that can be leveraged in diverse clinical indications. Namely, CAN-3110:
Is engineered to provide oncolysis through replication specifically in Nestin expressing cancer cells.
▪Has demonstrated statistically significant survival benefit in preclinical models of brain cancer. 
 ▪Has generated favorable tolerability and safety data, not reaching a dose limiting toxicity in the dose range tested in an ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1 trial. 
 ▪Has shown a clinical signal in a difficult to treat brain cancer population, critically defined by a highly immunosuppressive environment. 
 ▪Has been engineered to replicate in a range of other indications characterized by Nestin expression. 
 ▪Is derived from our HSV-based platform that also provides the potential to support expansion of our pipeline with novel agents. 
 CAN-3110 is an engineered HSV where the expression of ICP34.5, the gene responsible for viral replication, has been placed under the control of a tumor-specific Nestin promoter. Nestin is a cytoskeletal protein that is overexpressed in glioma cells, but it is absent in the healthy adult brain. In CAN-3110, ICP34.5 expression is controlled by the Nestin promotor enabling viral replication selectively in tumor cells. This replication-competent HSV construct provides tumor-specific cytolytic activity, while sparing healthy cells that do not express Nestin.
This modification of the viral genome of CAN-3110 enables us to maintain the function of ICP34.5, an HSV protein that allows virus replication even in the presence of a suppressive interferon response, under strict control and only in tumor cells.
ICP34.5 is deleted in other HSV oncolytic viruses that may be less tumor selective with an intent of achieving a favorable safety profile, which may result in viruses characterized by poor replication ability and a limited ability to generate an effective anti-tumor immune response.
Our Clinical Trials
 CAN-2409 for Prostate Cancer
We have completed multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in non-metastatic prostate cancer using CAN-2409 as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care. These trials generated favorable tolerability and safety data and also provide evidence to support CAN-2409 immune activation, dosing levels and schedules. We have administered CAN-2409 to about 900 patients with localized prostate cancer to date, most of whom are currently in ongoing, placebo-controlled randomized trials.
Monotherapy Activity
We have observed what we believe to be a clinical response with CAN-2409 as monotherapy in our Phase 1 trials. These responses have been consistently observed in patients with prostate cancer, including patients with newly diagnosed, localized disease, as well as those whose cancer was progressing even after radiotherapy.

In newly diagnosed patients with localized prostate cancer, analysis of biopsies following monotherapy CAN-2409 treatment revealed change in glandular architecture, necrosis and increased immune cell infiltration as compared to baseline biopsy. We observed in treated samples a 4-fold increase in the number of CD8+ T cells and a 3-fold increase in the number of CD68+ macrophages, demonstrating immune response after CAN-2409 administration.
In another Phase 1/2 clinical trial, patients whose prostate cancer had progressed following radiotherapy and that presented a persistently rising PSA level, were treated with CAN-2409 as monotherapy using six dose levels, ranging from 1x108–1x1011 viral particles. In 27 of the 36 patients recruited, a decrease in PSA levels was observed following a single cycle of CAN-2409, as measured by the best PSA decrease in serial assessments within the first 3 months after treatment. PSA, while an imperfect biomarker for prostate cancer, is still widely employed for patient management in conjunction with biopsy, as rising PSA levels, and in particular PSA doubling time are associated with disease progression. In that same trial, we observed that the PSA doubling time improved significantly (p=0.0271) from 15.9 months at baseline to 42.5 months after a single cycle of CAN-2409 administration, in this treatment resistant patient population. A subset of the patients in this trial also received second or third injection courses of CAN-2409. In most of those patients, a decrease from pre-administration PSA levels was again observed upon repeated injection.
Combination Therapy
Because of the increasing prevalence of combination therapy for cancer patients, the ability to combine novel agents with standard of care treatments without overlapping toxicity is of increasing importance. We believe that the favorable tolerability and safety data generated for CAN-2409 in our clinical trials is encouraging for our current and future development plans, in combination with other agents but also as a monotherapy in lower risk patient populations that are not willing to undergo more aggressive forms of treatment. The safety data from our Phase 2 clinical trial in prostate cancer patients treated with CAN-2409 in combination with standard of care of radiotherapy or androgen deprivation therapy, reported no grade 4 treatment-related adverse events and only single-patient incidence of grade 3 treatment related adverse events. It was anticipated that flu-like symptoms would be evident, because CAN-2409 is an adenoviral gene construct known to induce a systemic immune response. Greater than 50% of patients reported fever and/or chills often associated with viral immune activation. These symptoms, which generally manifested early and transiently, often occurred on the evening of the intratumoral administration of CAN-2409 and resolved by the following morning. The rates of the gastrointestinal adverse events are consistent with those typically reported by patients undergoing radiotherapy, which is a component of standard of care in this population.
Our previous Phase 2 clinical trial data informed our agreement with the FDA under the SPA for our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial. Although the data is limited as we have not conducted head-to-head studies, in our Phase 2 clinical trial we observed that intermediate-risk patients who received CAN-2409 in combination with radiotherapy had failure rates that were 75% lower than those reported in four other contemporaneous trials of similar patient populations. Where these other clinical trials reported freedom from failure rates of between 75%-79%, corresponding to cumulative recurrence rates of 21%-25%, CAN-2409 resulted in a 5% recurrence rate in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The median follow-up of patients who received CAN-2409 in this clinical trial was 5.7 years. Similarly, results in this clinical trial also demonstrated reduced recurrence rates in the low- and high-risk patients enrolled when compared to these other trials. Furthermore, a pathological complete response (pCR) was observed in 93% of the biopsies available at 2yrs (37%-73% in control populations). In this trial, low-risk patients achieved a PSA of < 2ng/ml in 77% of CAN-2409 treated patients versus 58% in control populations.
The endpoint used in our Phase 2 trial was freedom from failure (FFF), defined by the period of time between treatment and the occurrence of a clinical or biochemical failure. Under the SPA agreement, we have selected disease-free survival (DFS) as the endpoint for our Phase 3 clinical trial. The DFS definition requires an objective detection of tumor progression. This largely overlaps with FFF as it is often triggered by detection of increased PSA levels (i.e., biochemical failure). We have also reanalyzed our previous Phase 2 data using DFS parameters, supporting the implementation of DFS as endpoint in our Phase 3 trial.
Potentially Registrational Phase 3 Clinical Trial for Localized Prostate Cancer
We are developing CAN-2409 as a potential therapeutic option that avoids the long-term severe side effects of hormone therapy or surgical interventions. Based on the data from our clinical trials to date, we believe that CAN-2409 has the potential, if approved, to be the first new first-line product candidate approved for patients with localized prostate cancer in over 30 years. We are currently conducting a potentially registrational Phase 3 trial for CAN-2409, with agreement, under an SPA with the FDA for a single pivotal trial in newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer in intermediate and high-risk patients in combination with the standard of care, radiotherapy.
This Phase 3 clinical trial is fully enrolled with 711 patients, randomized 2:1. Patients receive three investigational treatment courses of CAN-2409, each consisting of four concurrent injections of transrectal ultrasound guided administration of CAN-2409 followed by a course of oral valacyclovir. The first injection course is given at least 15 days but not more than 8 weeks before starting radiation. The second injection course is given 0-3 days prior to radiotherapy. The third and final injection course is delivered 15-22 days after the second injections. A fixed dose of valacyclovir is

given for 14 days after each CAN-2409 administration. Standard of care external beam radiotherapy is administered to patients throughout the course of the trial with optional ADT as determined by the treating physician.
Trial inclusion criteria are based on patients with localized prostate cancer meeting the NCCN criteria of intermediate-risk or patients presenting only one NCCN high-risk feature. NCCN intermediate-risk is defined as having at least one of the following: prostate serum antigen (PSA) of 10-20 ng/ml, Gleason Score of 7, and is staged T2b-T2c via the TNM staging system. Patients may also exhibit one high-risk characteristic that may consist of a PSA of 20+ ng/ml, a Gleason Score of 8-10, or a cancer that is up to stage T3a, but not more than one of these high-risk factors.
The SPA agreement specifically defines agreement with the FDA on the statistical design and power of the Phase 3 trial, as well as the primary endpoint definition. The SPA states that the trial is adequately designed to provide the necessary data that, depending on the outcome, could support a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission. The SPA does note the general point for all SPAs, that BLA acceptance and approvability are review issues and that a BLA approval will depend on the quality of actual clinical trial data, the robustness of the effect on the stated primary endpoint, the impact on the secondary endpoints, a favorable assessment of the study conduct, and analysis of safety information and other supportive data. We have approximately 50 active clinical sites for this clinical trial and have completed enrollment in September 2021 with 711 patients. The primary endpoint for the clinical trial is DFS. This trial has been designed to have 90% power, a hazard ratio of 0.5 and an alpha of 0.05. We are assuming a 15% improvement in the active arm (CAN-2409) as compared to placebo in the rate of events measured according to the DFS definition provided above. We expect topline data from this Phase 3 trial at the end of 2024.
 Phase 2 Clinical Trial for Active Surveillance
Clinical results to date suggest that CAN-2409 as monotherapy may reduce the rates of biochemical failure for patients with localized prostate cancer. In the AS setting, we will assess whether CAN-2409 has the potential to delay or prevent tumor progression to a later stage that demands radical treatment.
In May 2019, the Company completed enrollment of 187 patients in its Phase 2 clinical trial of CAN-2409 in patients with low-to-intermediate-risk, localized, non-metastatic prostate cancer, randomized 2:1. The primary endpoint is biopsy-proven progression-free survival (PFS). Progression is defined as an increase in Gleason grade or increase in tumor volume to > 33%. As the primary endpoint is event-driven, in February 2023, based on a blinded review of the event rate, the Company determined that additional time is required for patient follow up in order to collect a sufficient number of events. Based on the current rate of events, the Company currently anticipates topline data to be available in the fourth quarter of 2024.
 CAN-2409 for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
To assess the potential for CAN-2409 to trigger local and systemic immune activation and produce a “hot” tumor phenotype, we designed and completed a clinical trial in patients with surgically resectable lung cancer. In this proof of mechanism Phase 1 clinical trial, dose escalation of intratumoral neoadjuvant CAN-2409 was followed by tumor resection three weeks later. The specific goal was to obtain biological data to better understand the impact of CAN-2409 on the tumor microenvironment, with a specific focus on intratumoral CD8+ T cell activation and function while assessing effects on the systemic immune response. The effects of CAN-2409 were evaluated by comparing post-injection specimens to an internal control consisting of each patient’s own pre-treatment needle biopsy and blood samples, and an external cohort of matched patients who underwent standard surgical resection without CAN-2409. The results showed evidence of significant intratumoral and systemic immune activation after experimental CAN-2409 monotherapy treatment. Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, both before and after CAN-2409 administration, demonstrated a significant increase in expression of proliferation and activation markers including HLA-DR, CD38 and Ki67 three weeks after CAN-2409 initiation. Other relevant findings in this clinical trial included an increase in markers of T cell activation such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, which are targets of ICI that have been approved for use in NSCLC.
In this NSCLC Phase 1 clinical trial, two patients experienced grade 3 dehydration with renal insufficiency, two patients presented grade 3 urinary retention and six patients were observed to have a grade 4 low lymphocyte count. Of significant interest, one patient, a 70 year-old male with a 14.8cm stage IIIA sarcomatoid carcinoma, exhibited a nearly 50% decrease in tumor volume at 3 weeks after CAN-2409 monotherapy treatment. Collectively, these results lead us to believe that CAN-2409 could provide an opportunity to improve ICI response rates in patients with NSCLC by eliciting additional immune activation in lung cancer patients.
CAN-2409 and Checkpoint Combination Phase 2 Clinical Trial for NSCLC in Patients with Inadequate Response to ICI
In 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in NSCLC patients with inadequate response to ICI that will enroll patients receiving standard of care ICI (plus chemotherapy if indicated) in combination with two courses of CAN-2409 plus continued ICI. This open label clinical trial, as amended, is targeting enrollment of approximately 80 patients with stage III/IV NSCLC in two separate cohorts. The cohorts are defined based on response to ICIs at the time of enrollment. Cohort 1 addresses patients with stable disease and Cohort 2 enrolls patients with progressive disease after at least 18

weeks of ICI treatment. Patients will continue treatment with their initial ICI and CAN-2409 will be added to their regimen. The primary efficacy endpoint for this trial is response rate measured by RECIST and/or Disease Control Rate.
 We reported initial data from this trial at the ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2022. During our Research and Development Day in December 2022, we presented updated data demonstrating evidence of local and systemic anti-tumor activity; a disease control rate of 77% (20/26) in patients entering trial with disease progression (cohort 2); sustained and ongoing clinical responses greater than 1 year; favorable change in the trajectory of tumor progression; decreased tumor size of RECIST target lesions in most patients; reduced uninjected tumor size in 14/21 patients (67%); an overall response rate of 13% (4/30) across cohorts 1 and 2; durable disease stabilization translating into encouraging preliminary evidence of progression-free survival; consistent induction of local and systemic cytotoxic T cell response; increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment; systemic expansion of effector T cells and increase in soluble granzyme B levels in the peripheral blood; and favorable safety/tolerability data with most treatment-related adverse events being grade 1/2.
We anticipate presenting additional updated data from this ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2023.
CAN-2409 for Pancreatic Cancer
We are currently conducting a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial for CAN-2409 in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, with a target enrollment of up to 54 patients. In March 2023, in connection with our cost management and dynamic portfolio management initiatives, we elected to pause new enrollment in this randomized Phase 2 clinical trial, subject to additional funding. Despite the pause in patient enrollment, we continue to expect to present initial clinical data in the fourth quarter of 2023. In a previous Phase 1b clinical trial, patients with pancreatic cancer treated with CAN-2409 in addition to standard of care demonstrated a greater survival duration over the expected survival of the patients treated with the existing standard of care alone in a comparison to historical trial results. Furthermore, in the subset of patients where pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies were available, a statistically significant increase in the number of CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes was observed. In addition, the study demonstrated that CAN-2409 was generally well-tolerated in combination with standard of care.
CAN-2409 for High-Grade Glioma
 Phase 3 Clinical Trial of CAN-2409 in High-Grade Glioma
 At our Research & Development Day in December 2022 we announced that we have made a portfolio and resource prioritization decision to pursue CAN-3110 in recurrent HGG, but not to pursue a Phase 3 clinical trial of CAN-2409 in high-grade glioma. The CAN-3110 program in recurrent HGG may serve as an enabling clinical trial for future expansion into earlier stages of HGG as well as other solid tumors outside the brain that are characterized by Nestin expression.
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial of CAN-2409 With Opdivo in High-Grade Glioma
 We conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed HGG examining the combination of CAN-2409 and anti-PD-1 nivolumab (Opdivo, BMS) in collaboration with BMS and Adult Brain Tumor Consortium. This was the first clinical trial to evaluate the combination of CAN-2409 and nivolumab in HGG patients with the goal of enhancing anti-tumor T cell activation and expansion and the potential for better clinical outcome.
 Data for this Phase 1 clinical trial were presented at the 37th Annual Meeting of Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) in Boston in November 2022. In the trial involving 35 evaluable patients, extensive biomarker analyses demonstrated that the combination of CAN-2409 and nivolumab resulted in a statistically significant expansion of activated tumor-fighting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells effector cells as well as decreased markers of exhaustion on effector cells. Proteomic analysis by OLINK revealed an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-gamma, the chemokines CXCL9/10 and CXCL11, MCP-1, MCP-3, and granzyme A. Systemic immune activation was observed after the single administration of CAN-2409, prior to initiation of nivolumab (week 3 post treatment). Median overall survival (mOS) for patients with methylated MGMT promoter was 30.6 months for those who underwent gross total resection (GTR) (n=10) and 12.6 months for those who underwent sub-total resection (STR) (n=5). mOS for patients with unmethylated MGMT was 13.2 months (GTR) (n=16) and 15.9 months (STR) (n=4), respectively.
Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial of CAN-2409 Combined with Standard of Care in High-Grade Glioma
 In our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in newly diagnosed patients with HGGs, including the difficult-to-treat glioblastoma, CAN-2409 demonstrated a statistically significant increase in patient survival when combined with current standard of care over the current standard of care alone (surgery, radiation and temozolomide). The trial compared the overall survival of 48 enrolled patients treated at 4 clinical sites with CAN-2409 plus standard of care against a matched controlled set of 134 patients enrolled at MGB who received only standard of care. The results demonstrated that the median overall survival of patients receiving standard of care alone was 13.5 months while patients receiving CAN-2409 plus standard of care was 17.1 months (p=0.0417). Importantly, a pre-planned analysis on a subset of patients treated surgically with gross total resection (>95% of tumor removed) during surgery (18 patients compared to 44 in the control arm),

demonstrated a median overall survival of 25.1 months in the CAN-2409 arm versus 16.3 months in the standard of care group, with approximately a 50% improvement (p=0.0120). In this patient population, after three years, one in three patients was alive in the CAN-2409 arm compared to 1 in 20 patients in the standard of care group. At the end of the study, three of the patients who received CAN-2409 were alive without progression after 43, 62.1 and 88.5 months. CAN-2409 was generally well tolerated, with most treatment-related adverse events being grade 1 or 2, and few reports of grade 3 or 4 events.
 Opportunities for CAN-2409 in Other Cancer Indications
In addition to patients with prostate, lung, pancreatic, and brain cancer, CAN-2409 has been dosed in small early-stage exploratory clinical trials in patients with ovarian cancer, malignant pleural effusion, pediatric brain cancer and retinoblastoma, supporting the tolerability and safety profile described above.
CAN-3110 for Recurrent High-grade Glioma
Our first HSV-based product candidate, CAN-3110, is in an ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial in recurrent HGG. This is an open-label, single center, dose-escalation clinical trial in patients who have failed standard of care. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is to analyze the safety of CAN-3110 use in patients with recurrent HGG. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in doses ranging from 1x106 to 1x1010 PFU in half-log increments. 51 patients have been treated.
 Immunohistology studies showed persistent presence of HSV antigen and infiltration by CD8+ cytotoxic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes post treatment, providing support for the expected mechanism of action of CAN-3110.
We are particularly encouraged by the clinical course of a few patients who received a single injection with CAN-3110 as monotherapy upon recurrence of glioblastoma. One patient, originally diagnosed with multicentric glioblastoma and initially treated with standard of care surgical resection followed by temozolomide and radiotherapy has been treated with CAN-3110 monotherapy, upon recurrency with development of two lesions visualized on MRI. One lesion, in the frontal region, had developed at the site of the initially resected mass. The second, larger mass was a new lesion. The patient received CAN-3110 via stereotactic administration into the injected lesion. At day 56 post-injection, there was a visible decrease in the volume of both masses. By day 112 post-injection, the volume of both masses was further reduced and the patient was able to go back to work. The patient eventually developed a third lesion, experienced a stroke secondary to a diagnostic procedure, and refused further treatment, dying approximately 15 months after entering the trial. A second patient initially diagnosed with methylated grade IV HGG located in the temporal lobe underwent 2 consecutive resections and treatment with chemoradiation for rapid progressive disease. The patient was injected with CAN-3110 (10E8 pfus), at the site of the original lesion. An MRI scan performed at day 91 showed increased enhancement at the site of injection. The patient underwent an additional resection, but, importantly, histological report showed mainly inflammatory tissue with high density of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. The patient did not have detectable disease, in absence of any additional treatment for more than 2 years and passed away as passenger of a motor vehicle accident on day 717 post CAN-3110 treatment. Another patient, originally diagnosed with grade IV astrocytoma, was treated with CAN-3110 for a recurrence following first-line therapy with subtotal resection, chemoradiation and adjuvant temozolomide. At time of recurrence, a mass was evident in the left frontal lobe. The patient was enrolled in arm B of the Phase 1 clinical trial which includes treatment with Cytoxan (24 mg/kg one dose day -2) prior to CAN-3110 injection. Post-treatment scan demonstrated progressive reduction in enhancement with cavitary necrosis at the site of injection. The patient remains clinically stable as of February 2023 and has not required additional therapies up to day 350 post CAN-3110. We find these case reports to be encouraging because of the unusually favorable disease course experienced by these patients with recurrent HGG who had previously failed standard of care treatment, in absence of concurrent therapies. Additionally, we have observed a median overall survival of 11.6 months in the Phase 1 trial in the first 41 patients as of the cutoff date of October 2022. Given the median overall survival of 6-9 months in historical clinical trials of other investigational agents in patients with recurrent HGG, who have failed standard of care treatment we believe this is encouraging evidence of clinical activity. We will continue to assess CAN-3110 in this clinical trial.

•NT-3 Assets: a single digit percentage of net sales of NT-3 Assets, or, if applicable, a percentage of royalties received by us in the event of a license, sublicense, assignment or other transfer to a third party for commercialization (but no greater than the original royalty percentage we would be required to pay in the event we did not license, sublicense, assign or transfer NT-3 Assets); 
 •Gene Transfer Neuro-Assets: a single digit percentage of net sales of Gene Transfer Neuro-Assets, or, if applicable, a percentage of royalties received by us in the event of a license, sublicense, assignment or other transfer to a third party for commercialization to treat certain conditions and diseases (but no greater than the original royalty percentage we would be required to pay in the event we did not license, sublicense, assign or transfer Gene Transfer Neuro-Assets); 
 •Combination Products: a certain percentage (based on the weighted average sale price of NT-3 Assets, or Gene Transfer Neuro-Assets, as applicable) of net sales of combination products; and 
 •Disposition Income: (i) a single digit royalty rate of certain consideration we receive for the grant of a license, assignment or other intellectual property rights related to the NT-3 Assets and (ii) if we consummate a strategic collaboration with certain specified parties to treat non-oncolygic neurological conditions and diseases, either 2nd decile (if consummated within 18 months) or mid-2nd decile to mid-3rd decile (if consummated thereafter) royalty rates of certain consideration we receive for the grant of a license, assignment or other intellectual property rights related to the Gene Transfer Neuro-Assets. 
 If we are required to pay royalties to a third party on any product covered under the Periphagen Agreements, we may credit such royalty payments against the royalties owed to Periphagen in the applicable country, up to a percentage reduction in the mid-2nd decile.
The exclusive license agreement with Periphagen (the Periphagen License Agreement) requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete a human proof of concept clinical trial of an NT-3 Asset, which includes certain specified clinical milestones. If we fail to use such efforts, subject to dispute and escalation provisions in the Periphagen License Agreement, then we may submit a specified payment in lieu of satisfying such obligations. If we fail to do so, Periphagen may terminate the Periphagen License Agreement for material breach. On December 15, 2022, Periphagen provided notice purporting to terminate the Periphagen License Agreement claiming we failed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete a human proof of concept clinical trial of an NT-3 Asset. We have denied Periphagen’s claim and the parties are engaged in the dispute and escalation provisions under the Periphagen License Agreement. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings”.
The Periphagen License Agreement expires on the later of December 9, 2069 or the end of the Royalty Term. Upon expiration, we will have a fully paid-up, non-exclusive license to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import any products that incorporate the Licensed IP Rights. The Royalty Term means, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, the period starting on the first commercial sale of such product in such country and concluding on the later of (i) expiration of patent coverage under the Licensed IP Rights or regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country; or (ii) the date that a certain amount of generic competition exists in such country, provided that no Royalty Term shall exceed 30 years.
The Periphagen License Agreement may be terminated (i) by us for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice to Periphagen, (ii) by Periphagen if we remain in breach of the Periphagen Agreement following a cure period to remedy the breach or (iii) by Periphagen if we become bankrupt, file for bankruptcy or otherwise become insolvent or are placed in receivership.
Mass General Brigham (MGB). On January 20, 2018, we entered into an exclusive option agreement (the Option Agreement) with MGB. Pursuant to the Option Agreement, we obtained the exclusive right from MGB to negotiate an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize products covered by certain MGB patents, including those patents covering CAN-3110, in the field of gene therapy and vector therapy for the treatment or

prevention of cancerous tumors in humans or animals, as such field is further detailed in the Option Agreement (Licensed Field). In consideration for MGB’s granting of the exclusive option, we paid MGB a non-refundable fee of $40,000.
Under the Option Agreement, we were required to use reasonable efforts to enter into a clinical trial agreement with MGB. We entered into such clinical trial agreement with MGB (MGB Clinical Trial Agreement) on June 19, 2018. Under the MGB Clinical Trial Agreement, we have committed to remitting up to $750,000 for the performance of a specified Phase 1 clinical trial by MGB pursuant to a protocol summary contained in the Option Agreement.
On September 15, 2020, we exercised our option and entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with MGB (the MGB License Agreement). Under the MGB License Agreement, MGB granted to us (a) an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain of MGB’s patents to make, have made, use, have used, sell and have sold certain products covered by such licensed patents (the Licensed Products) and otherwise practice processes covered by such licensed patents (Licensed Processes); and (b) a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain other of MGB’s patents to make, have made, use, have used, sell and have sold Licensed Products, but not to sell or have sold Licensed Processes. The foregoing rights are sublicensable, subject to sublicensing terms set forth in the MGB License Agreement. In connection with executing the MGB License Agreement, we paid a license issue fee of $100,000. We also agreed to reimburse MGB for all reasonable fees and expenses MGB had incurred and will incur for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights, in an amount equal to $141,268.
Under the MGB License Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and make available to the public Licensed Products in the Licensed Field, which efforts include certain milestones detailed in the MGB License Agreement.
Under the MGB License Agreement, prior to the first commercial sale of the Licensed Products, we are required to pay MGB an annual license fee beginning on the fourth anniversary of the effective date. Following the first commercial sale of the Licensed Products, we are required to pay MGB an annual minimum royalty, which amount may be credited against earned royalties starting in the fourth year following the first commercial sale.
In addition to such annual license fee and royalty obligations, the MGB License Agreement contains cumulative milestone payments for up to a maximum amount of $39,000,000, upon the achievement of various clinical, commercial and sales milestones of clinical and commercial development and sales, certain of which milestones apply to development and sale of any Licensed Product as a monotherapy and certain of which milestones apply to development and sale of any Licensed Product in combination with another therapy modality for the treatment of solid tumors.
We are required to pay royalties to MGB upon first commercial sale of the Licensed Products, which are paid at an increasing rate as net sales increase, ranging from low single digits to high single digits. We also agreed to pay a single digit royalty rate on net sales of any products developed using certain MGB know-how but which is not covered by the licensed patent rights, or derived products.
We may reduce our royalty obligations to MGB on any product (but not derived products) by an agreed-upon percentage if we are required to pay a royalty to a third party to avoid patent infringement claims in respect of our development and commercialization of Licensed Products. The royalty rate paid to MGB may not fall below a pre-specified percentage for the sale of any product and another percentage for the sale of any derived product.
Our obligation to pay royalties to MGB expires on a country-by-country basis on the latest of (i) the date upon which there ceases to be a valid claim of patent rights as further detailed in the MGB License Agreement in such country, (ii) expiration of statutory or regulatory exclusivity in such country and (iii) 10 years after the first commercial sale.
The MGB License Agreement also requires us to pay a percentage of any non-royalty income attributable to the sublicense, including (i) 2nd decile rates if such sublicense occurs prior to dosing the first patient in a Phase 2 trial, (ii) 1st decile rates if such sublicense occurs after dosing the first patient in a Phase 2 trial but before approval of a BLA by the FDA (or the equivalent approval and regulatory body in another major market country) and (iii) single digit rates if such sublicense occurs after approval of a BLA by the FDA (or the equivalent approval and regulatory body in another major market country).
The MGB License Agreement expires on the latest of (i) the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale in the last country which has a commercial sale, (ii) the date on which all relevant issued patents and filed patent applications have expired or been abandoned and (iii) upon the expiration of market exclusivity on the applicable product.
The MGB License Agreement may be terminated by MGB (i) if we fail to pay any amounts owed under the terms of the agreement within a specified cure period, (ii) if we fail to maintain insurance in accordance with the MGB License Agreement, (iii) if we file for bankruptcy, or (iv) if we remain in default of the MGB License Agreement for non-financial reasons following a specified cure period to remedy the breach. The MGB License Agreement may be terminated by us for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice.

Ventagen. On March 1, 2014, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the Ventagen Agreement), with Ventagen, LLC (Ventagen). The Ventagen Agreement provides Ventagen an exclusive license, with rights to grant sublicenses (subject to certain terms and conditions) under any worldwide patent rights and know-how owned or controlled by us during the term of the Ventagen Agreement which cover applicable technology utilizing the delivery method of the herpes derived TK protein to tumors or other tissues via a viral vector (as further specified therein), to research, use, have used, import, have imported, export, have exported, offer for sale, have sold, sell, distribute and market certain products for the prevention or treatment of cancer in humans and any use in animals (or the Field of Use) (Licensed Products), for commercial sale and distribution within Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia and Bolivia (or the Territory).
Under the Ventagen Agreement, Ventagen agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize Licensed Products in the Territory in the Field of Use.
Ventagen agreed to pay us $1,000,000 for research and development, which we received in 2014 and 2015, and agreed to pay us a fixed future milestone payment of $2,500,000 upon Ventagen’s achievement of a specified amount of sales of a Licensed Product, which is subject to certain reductions for our direct cost over a specified threshold.
Ventagen also agreed to purchase all of its clinical and commercial supply of Licensed Products from us required for clinical or commercial purposes at a price of cost plus a specified increase of the wholesale price of the Licensed Products, subject to a minimum and maximum price, through the end of the Royalty Term, which is defined as the period commencing on the effective date of the Ventagen Agreement and ending on a country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the last expiration date of the patent rights covering a Licensed Product, (ii) twelve years from the receipt of marketing authorization of the Licensed Product in the applicable country, or (iii) the date a generic version of a Licensed Product that is manufactured, owned or controlled by a third party is granted a market authorization. If we are unable or unwilling to manufacture supply under the terms of the Ventagen Agreement, Ventagen has the right to manufacture its own supply and will be required to pay to us a fixed fee per dose sold by Ventagen, its affiliates, agents, sublicensee or end users. We have also agreed to provide certain services to Ventagen related to Ventagen’s development plan.
The Ventagen Agreement expires on the date of the expiration of the final Royalty Term in all countries in the Territory. The Ventagen Agreement may be terminated (i) by Ventagen at will upon 30 days’ prior written notice to us, (ii) by us subject to a specified notice period if Ventagen files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent or (iii) by us if Ventagen remains in material breach of the Ventagen Agreement following notice and a cure period to remedy the breach. Ventagen retains an irrevocable, perpetual, paid up, royalty-free license, with rights of sublicense to use, have used, lease, import and export, offer to sell, sell, have sold, product, distribute and market Licensed Products in each country in the Territory after the expiration of the Royalty Term in such country.
Certain of our current stockholders own 49.5% of the voting stock of Ventagen, but we do not hold any management position or run the day-to-day operations of Ventagen. See “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions.”
 Competition
The development and commercialization of new product candidates is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others with respect to CAN-2409 and CAN-3110 and will face similar competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. We compete in pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop immuno-oncology therapies for the treatment of cancer. There are other companies working to develop viral immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer including divisions of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies of various sizes. The large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that have commercialized and/or are developing immuno-oncology treatments for cancer include AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Merck & Co., Novartis, Pfizer and Genentech.
Some of the products and therapies developed by our competitors are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, including with respect to the use of viral immunotherapy with adenovirus and HSV. Other competitive products and therapies are based on entirely different approaches. We are aware that Oncorus, Inc., Replimune Group, Inc., Amgen Inc., Astellas Pharma, Inc, Istari Oncology Inc, Orca Therapeutics, B.V., CG Oncology, Inc, ImmVira Co., Ltd., IconOVir Bio, Inc., and FerGene, Inc., among others, are developing viral immunotherapies that may have utility for the treatment of indications that we are targeting. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
Many of the companies we compete against or may compete against in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in the concentration of even more resources among a smaller

number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, in establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials and in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, or are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and price, if required, the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Commercialization
We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other regions. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company commercializing products. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans.
Manufacturing
We have established an operations leadership team with extensive experience in manufacturing biologics based on viruses, including viral immunotherapy products and gene therapy products, and in the construction, validation, approval and operation of facilities designed to manufacture biologics. We have secured a third-party contract manufacturing organization for clinical and commercial-scale manufacturing of our CAN-2409 product candidates. We are also currently evaluating various options for the clinical-scale manufacture of our CAN-3110 product candidate, including the development of clinical-scale manufacturing capabilities at our own facility.
Intellectual Property
We believe that approval of our CAN-2409 and CAN-3110 product candidates under a BLA may result in 12 years of data exclusivity in the United States under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively the ACA), 10 years of market exclusivity in Europe and significant durations in other markets, which would be complementary to any relevant patent exclusivity.
With regard to patent exclusivities, we have rights to issued composition of matter patents in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, and Japan and patent applications pending in Australia, Europe, and Korea that relate to CAN-3110. The issued patents and the pending applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2036. This patent family is exclusively licensed to us. We also own a United States patent and a pending patent application that relate to a method of use of CAN-2409 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. The issued patent and the pending application, if issued, are expected to expire in 2034. We also have in-licensed from Periphagen patents and patent applications relating to our enLIGHTEN Discovery Platform. These patents and applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2037 and 2042.
 Government Regulation
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and licensure under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The FD&C Act and corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, clinical trial, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, marketing, promotion, export and import, advertising, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting involving biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
Further, even if we obtain the required regulatory approvals for our products, pharmaceutical companies are subject to myriad federal, state, and foreign healthcare laws, rules, and regulations governing all aspects of our operations, including, but not limited to, our relationships with healthcare professionals, healthcare institutions, distributors of our products, and sales and marketing personnel; governmental and other third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of our products; and data privacy and security. Such laws, rules, and regulations are complex, continuously evolving, and, in many cases, have not been subject to extensive interpretation by applicable regulatory agencies or the courts. We

are required to invest significant time and financial resources in policies, procedures, processes, and systems to ensure compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations, and our failure to do so may result in the imposition of substantial monetary or other penalties by federal or state regulatory agencies, give rise to reputational harm, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
United States Biological Products Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a biological product candidate may be licensed for marketing in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practices (GLPs) requirements and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an application for an investigational new drug application (IND) which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval of the protocol and related documentation by an IRB or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to good clinical practices (GCPs) requirements and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product candidate for its intended use; 
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes sufficient evidence of establishing the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended indication, including from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept and file the application; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-license inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA in accordance with any applicable expedited programs or designations; 
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies); and 
 •FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for specific indications for use in the United States. 
 Pre-clinical Studies and the IND Process
Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of the product’s biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
Prior to commencing an initial clinical trial in humans with a product candidate in the United States, an IND must be submitted to the FDA and the FDA must allow the IND to proceed. An IND is an exemption from the FD&C Act that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA allowance that such investigational product may be administered to humans in connection with such trial. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration. In support of a request for an IND, the clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Once submitted, the IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the IND on a full or partial clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial or part of the study can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a sponsor’s IND at any time before or during clinical trials due to, among other considerations, unreasonable or significant safety concerns, inability to assess safety concerns, lack of qualified investigators, a misleading or materially incomplete investigator brochure,

study design deficiencies, interference with the conduct or completion of a study designed to be adequate and well-controlled for the same or another investigational product, insufficient quantities of investigational product, lack of effectiveness, or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters and criteria to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. An IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee (DSMB). This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the trial and may recommend halting the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
Certain information about certain clinical trials must also be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the biological product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population with a specific disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3. The biological product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for approval and product labeling. 
 In March 2022, the FDA released a final guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology biological product development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to biological product development and reduce developmental costs and time.
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for

manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Both the FDA and the EMA provide expedited pathways for the development of biological product candidates for treatment of rare diseases, particularly life threatening diseases with high unmet medical need. Such biological product candidates may be eligible to proceed to registration following a single clinical trial in a limited patient population, sometimes referred to as a Phase 1/2 trial, but which may be deemed a pivotal or registrational trial following review of the trial’s design and primary endpoints by the applicable regulatory agencies. Determination of the requirements to be deemed a pivotal or registrational trial is subject to the applicable regulatory authority’s scientific judgement and these requirements may differ in the United States and the European Union.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some trials also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
Assuming successful the completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human clinical trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances. Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) for original BLAs, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to ensure its continued safety, purity and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult or novel questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for

review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel product (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, including to subpopulations of patients, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, precautions or interactions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing trials. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
Orphan Product Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or 200,000 or more individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
Orphan product designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. If a product that has orphan product designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan product exclusivity. Competitors,

however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan drug status in the European Union (EU) has similar, but not identical, benefits.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. To be eligible for fast track designation, new drugs and biological product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a fast track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of fast track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with the FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review.
Under the FDA’s breakthrough therapy program, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast track designation. The FDA may take other actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including holding meetings with the sponsor and providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development program.
A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Additionally, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials, which must be conducted with due diligence, to verify the clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit and, under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), the FDA may require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date accelerated approval was granted. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials, intended for dissemination or publication be submitted to the agency for review. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.
Post-Approval Requirements

Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements, as well as requirements relating to record keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. Manufacturers of products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
Manufacturers must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detentions or refusal to permit the import or export of the product, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors or other stakeholders, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements on sponsors and their contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug and biological products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of a biological product, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The United States Patent and trademark Office (USPTO) in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, including some regulatory exclusivity periods tied to patent terms. This six-month

exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
The ACA includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until 12 years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate implementation and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
United States Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
Our product candidates may require use of an in vitro diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval (PMA approval).
If use of companion diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biological product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic contemporaneously with the approval of the therapeutic product. On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel candidates such as our product candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug or biological candidate should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a biologic product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance document intended to further assist sponsors of therapeutic products and sponsors of in vitro companion diagnostic devices on issues related to co-development of these products.
The FDA generally requires companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval of a PMA for that diagnostic contemporaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of therapeutic candidates such as those we are developing

involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and pre-clinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are also subject to an application fee.
PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive pre-clinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. In addition, as part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR) which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or a not-approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will issue an order denying approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable order. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines.
Government Regulation Outside of The United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization and approval of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Clinical Trials Regulation
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, an application must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country’s national competent authority (NCA), and at least one independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Under the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022, a single application is now made through the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) for clinical trial authorization in up to 30 EU/EEA countries at the same time and with a single set of documentation.
 The assessment of applications for clinical trials is divided into two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State, however overall related timelines are defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. The new Clinical Trials Regulation also provides for simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors.
 European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the EU, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization. To obtain regulatory approval of a medicinal product in the EU, we must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA). A centralized marketing authorization is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA, and is valid throughout the EU and the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (the EEA). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (i.e. gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines), and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who makes the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
The application used to submit the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, although there may be certain specific requirements, for example those set out in Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on advanced therapy medicinal products, covering gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue-engineered medicinal products.
Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain is no longer covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January, 1 2021. For a period of three years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required. On January 24, 2023, the MHRA announced that a new international recognition framework will be put in place from January 1, 2024, which will have regard to decisions on the approval of marketing authorizations made by the European Medicines Agency and certain other regulators when determining an application for a new Great Britain marketing authorization.
 Data and Market Exclusivity

In the EU, upon receiving a marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete and independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MAA can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained a marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Products receiving orphan designation in the EU can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no “similar medicinal product” may be placed on the market. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan medicinal product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU where an agreed pediatric investigation plan (PIP) for pediatric studies has been complied with. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate (SPC) can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if it meets the following criteria: (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five (5) in ten thousand (10,000) persons in the EEA when the application is made, or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product would be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon the grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, a marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product for the same indication at any time if:
•the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized orphan product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 
 •the marketing authorization holder of the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or 
 •the marketing authorization holder of the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 
 Pediatric Development
In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a PIP with the EMA’s pediatric committee (PDCO) and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the product for which a marketing authorization is being sought. The MAA for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted by the PDCO of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be

completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under an SPC (provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to 2 years before the SPC expires) even where the trial results are negative. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
Post-Approval Controls
Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include the following:
•The holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (PSURs). 
 •All new MAAs must include a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. 
 •All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another. 
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, and the UK and the EU have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not provide for wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework continues to apply in Northern Ireland). Except in respect of the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, the regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current EU medicines regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge more significantly in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. However, notwithstanding that there is no wholesale recognition of EU pharmaceutical legislation under the TCA, under the new framework mentioned above which will be put in place by the MHRA from January 1, 2024, the MHRA has stated that it will still take into account decisions on the approval of marketing authorizations from the EMA (and certain other regulators) when considering an application for Great Britain marketing authorization.
 Health Reform
 In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition to coverage under Medicare Part D for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:


•The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% payment reduction which remains in effect through 2030. 
 •The American Taxpayer Relief Act further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Due to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, estimated budget deficit increases resulting from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and subsequent legislation, Medicare payments to providers will be further reduced starting in 2025 absent further legislation.
 •On April 13, 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
 •On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 •On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
 Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services and result in reduced demand for certain pharmaceutical products or additional pricing pressures. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries to $2,000 starting in 2025; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay the rebate rule that would limit the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. presidential executive orders, congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
 President Biden has also issued multiple executive orders that have sought to reduce prescription drug costs. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate

demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS, an agency within HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon several factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a product is:
 •a covered benefit under its health plan;
 •safe, effective and medically necessary;
 •appropriate for the specific patient;
 •cost-effective; and
 •neither experimental nor investigational.
 Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs. Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, which will require additional expenditure above and beyond the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European

Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act (FCA) prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.
The federal civil monetary penalties laws impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary, if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity may be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, impose, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their respective business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.

The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other licensed health care practitioners and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state and require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement we could be subject to penalties.
 Federal Consumer Protection and Unfair Competition Laws Broadly Regulate Marketplace Activities and Activities That Potentially Harm Consumers.
Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be broader in scope than the provisions described above and may apply regardless of payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and relevant federal government compliance guidance; require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers; restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws may govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 76 employees. Of these employees, 61 perform research and development functions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe we maintain good relations with our employees.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. On December 15, 2022, Periphagen notified us by letter of its claim that we have failed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete a human proof of concept clinical trial of an NT-3 Asset under an Exclusive License Agreement dated December 9, 2019 between us and Periphagen (the “Periphagen License Agreement”). We have denied Periphagen’s claims. On January 13, 2023, we

filed a demand for arbitration against Periphagen with the American Arbitration Association, seeking a declaration that Periphagen’s December 15 letter failed to comply with the dispute and escalation provisions in the Periphagen License Agreement. After filing the demand, the parties began engaging in the dispute and escalation process under the Periphagen License Agreement. On March 10, 2023, Periphagen filed its answer and counterclaims to our demand for arbitration. In its counterclaims, Periphagen seeks a declaration that we have not used commercially reasonable efforts to complete a human proof of concept clinical trial of the NT-3 Asset and a declaration that any further extension of time would not be scientifically or commercially reasonable. Periphagen also seeks a declaration that we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the NT-3 Asset during any remaining time under the agreement. We have denied Periphagen’s counter claims.
 In the event the parties are unable to resolve the dispute as part of the escalation process, an arbitrator will decide whether we have used commercially reasonable efforts. In the event that the arbitrator determines that we have not used commercially reasonable efforts, then we may submit a specified payment in lieu of satisfying such obligations.
 Aside from the proceeding with Periphagen, we are not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are probable to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
