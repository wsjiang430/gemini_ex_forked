ITEM 1. | DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
------------+----------------------------

 
We were originally incorporated in Nevada on September 11, 2006, under the name The Engraving Masters, Inc. (the “Company”).
 
On May 2, 2014, we changed our name to Blue Line Protection Group, Inc.
 
On May 6, 2014, our directors approved a 14-for-1 forward stock split. In connection with the stock split, our authorized capital increased to 1,400,000,000 shares of common stock. All references to share and per share amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been retroactively restated to reflect the forward stock split.
 
We provide armed protection and transportation, banking, compliance and training services for businesses engaged in the legal cannabis industry. During the year ended December 31, 2018 approximately 75% of our revenue was derived from armed protection and transportation services. The remaining 25% of our revenue was derived from compliance (3%), and other services (22%).
 
In March 2015, our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary, BLPG, Inc., was granted licenses to provide our services in Nevada.
 
Our base of operations is in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. Our corporate headquarters are located at 5765 Logan Street, Denver, CO 80216.
 
Principal Services
 
Cultivation facilities are the producers of legal cannabis that eventually make its way to consumers. Growers’ operations typically span a large geographic footprint, making them susceptible to theft, as are shipments from the growers to testing laboratories or to retail dispensaries. Additionally, due to current federal marijuana legislation and banking environment, growers are finding it increasingly difficult to secure their cash, purchase equipment and obtain financing for expansion.

Dispensaries are the retail face of the legal cannabis industry. All legal sales of cannabis products are transacted through dispensaries that are state-licensed. To maintain their licenses, dispensaries must comply with a variety of state-mandated reporting requirements, including reporting every gram of cannabis passing in and out of the store. Dispensaries also face financing and banking challenges similar to those that growers encounter.
 
We do not grow, test or sell cannabis.
 
Our services cover the following:
 
Protection and Transportation
 
Fundamental to the legal cannabis industry is the protection of product and cash throughout the distribution channel. Growers ship product from their cultivation facilities to independent laboratories where it is tested for compliance with state-mandated parameters. From the labs, the product is then delivered to the retail dispensaries, where it is sold to the public.
 
Due to the current banking and regulatory environments, payments between each step in the distribution network are made in cash: from the customer back to the grower. Therefore, these businesses are forced into having to transport bags of money between growers and dispensaries and their own vaults or storage facilities.
 
The risk of theft of cash and product is present at every stage, even when they are not in transit. Accordingly, all cannabis businesses require security measures to prevent theft, mitigate risk to employees and maintain regulatory compliance.
 
We began our security and protection operations in Colorado in February 2014. In less than six months, we have become the largest legal cannabis protection services company in the state. We offer a fully integrated approach to managing the movement of cannabis and cash from growers through dispensaries via armed and armored transport, money processing, vaulting and related credit. Money processing services generally include counting, sorting and wrapping currency.
 
We currently supply guards, protection and armed and armored transportation to approximately 60% of all the licensees in Colorado. We are focused on encompassing all compliance needs on behalf of our clients, as mandated by the State and Federal authorities for the protection, transport and sale of cannabis.
 
We also offer security monitoring, asset vaulting, and VIP and dignitary protection.
 
Banking
 
The banking system in the U.S. is, in most states, federally regulated. Possession or distribution of marijuana violates federal law, and banks that provide support for those activities face the risk of prosecution and assorted sanctions. Currently, almost all payments for the sales of cannabis are made in cash, due the inability of sellers to obtain merchant processing accounts. As a result, processing money from marijuana sales puts federally insured banks at risk of drug racketeering charges, so they’ve refused to open accounts for marijuana-related businesses. 
 
Marijuana businesses that can’t use banks may have too much cash they can’t safely put away, leaving them vulnerable to criminals. Jurisdictions that allow cannabis sales want a channel to receive taxes.
 
In February 2014, The Obama administration gave banks a road map for conducting transactions with cannabis sellers operating within state regulations, so these companies can stash away savings, make payroll and pay taxes like a traditional place of business. The move was designed to let financial institutions serve such businesses while ensuring that they know their customers’ legitimacy and remain obligated to report possible criminal activity. However, there remains nothing expressly protecting banks that work with state-legal, state-licensed marijuana businesses from prosecution. We are unaware of any bank, in any state, allowing bank accounts for cannabis-related businesses for fear of prosecution and losing their FDIC status and insurance.

We have created a means for the banks to validate compliance with the Federal Mandate. Currently only a security company could match the compliance requirements as only we can vertically integrate the source of funds through the Federally required 12 steps, summarized as from grow, to sale, (to those of approved age or license), to purchaser, to funds received, to where the funds were held, to vault, to third party validation, to tax, to profits, to access to the banking system etc. We are uniquely positioned, through a number of partnership and cooperation agreements, to provide banking solutions to our clients.
 
Compliance
 
Laws concerning business procedures and practices are changing across the nation. It’s hard to keep up with all the changes, and business owners have to balance their day-to-day operations with remaining compliant with and responsive to regulatory agencies. Blue Line Protection Group provides daily on-site compliance verification to ensure that local business owners are operating lawful and inspection-ready establishments. Our security experts, trained in crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) techniques, can provide crucial advice about enhancing the interior and exterior security of your establishment.
 
We communicate regularly with local and national government representatives to ensure that we remain the top-tier security and protection group in the nation. Retail establishments aren’t the only ones who have to remain compliant with the pertinent laws - we do, as well.
 
We have agreed a joint venture with one of the largest PEO HR companies in America out of Phoenix Arizona. They will handle all payments to employees of the companies we serve. They will also handle background checks on all employees. We will receive a percentage of every contract.
 
With the addition of our compliance module clients can be confident they will not lose their license for some small or large error by their staff that might put their cannabis license in jeopardy. Their license being, in most instances, their most valuable asset. We are relieving them of several burdens they are ill suited to comply with. (Most licensees were formally acting outside the law prior to the recent legislation and have little to no compliance experience).
 
Training
 
Over 90% of our security personnel have established military or police background. We ensure our employees are prepared to offer clients, their staff and customers a safe and secure environment. All members of the Company’s armored transportation team and security operators are required to undertake our mandatory, rigorous 40-hour introductory compliance and training curriculum created and supervised by both:

1. | The former Chief of Police for the City of Aurora, the second largest city in Colorado and 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | A 17 year veteran of Law Enforcement with certifications including: NRA Law Enforcement patrol rifle instructor, Colorado POST, and handgun instructor. 
3. | A 15 year veteran of Federal Law Enforcement with certifications including: NRA Law Enforcement handgun and shotgun instructor. 

 
In addition to internal training, we also offer other businesses, houses of worship and the general public a wide variety of safety, security and personal defense courses and firearms training.

Growth Strategy
 

1. | Expand into new markets to establish first-mover advantages. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Market ourselves through strategic alliances and affiliations. 
3. | Acquire or joint venture with guard and alarm businesses throughout the USA if they represent good value and a good fit with our expansion plans. Organic growth will not suffice for the rapid growth of this industry and our ability to provide service immediately requires variations of this strategy. 
4. | Increase our client base to the various labs in state. Offering our superior chain of control compliance and software. 
5. | Develop and offer value-added, complementary or supplementary services. 

 
The development of the legal markets for cannabis is a function of state legislation. As a result, while specific markets may not be currently available, we actively monitor the progress of legislation and know with some degree of certainty when new geographic markets will be coming on line. This allows us to target our limited sales and marketing resources to those new markets. In this way, we believe the current legislative environment works in our favor - if the whole country were currently a potential market our limited resources would result in an inability to effectively cover all potential market territories. With limited markets open we can better cover those available territories.
 
Marketing
 
Virtually all of our sales, to date, have been generated without using paid media. Our security personnel conduct the majority of our marketing and advertising efforts. Nearly all of our guards are former police officers or military personnel and are the face of our company. They interact with business owners, employees and customers on a daily basis. As such, they generate significant brand awareness and word-of-mouth goodwill. Complementary to this, our management actively engages with business owners directly to generate awareness of our company and the services we provide, as well as to identify the potential for sales or referrals.
 
In addition to a direct sales approach and word-of-mouth advertising, we have been featured in news articles and video documentaries by outlets such as the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Fortune and CNBC, which have served to increase brand awareness nationwide. We have also attended a variety of industry trade shows and have been granted membership in industry groups.
 
Industry Background
 
The total market for marijuana, legal or otherwise, is estimated to exceed the economic value of corn and wheat combined. Marijuana is widely considered the largest cash crop in the United States. Businesses have been positioning themselves for years, each trying to establish a leadership position in the legal marijuana industry that management expects to be worth over $50 billion by the year 2020. California and Colorado each expect to collect tax revenue of approximately $300,000,000 during their 2018 fiscal years.

Competition
 
We believe the primary factors in attracting and retaining customers are expertise, service quality, and price. Our competitive advantages include:
 

● | Brand name recognition; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reputation; 
● | Expertise in regulatory and banking compliance; 
● | Operational excellence; 
● | Cash processing, transportation and storage capabilities; 
● | Security and logistics infrastructure; 
● | Services beyond guards and transportation, where we become intimate to the businesses continuance and success through mandatory standards of compliance; and 
● | Economies of scale as we increase the amount and number of items we securely transport. 

 
Our cost structure is generally competitive, although certain competitors may have lower costs due to a variety of factors, including lower wages, lower initial and ongoing training requirements, less costly employee benefits, or less stringent security and service standards. We anticipate facing competitive pricing pressure in many markets; however, we plan to resist competing on price alone. We believe our high levels of service and security, as well as value-added solutions, differentiates us from competitors.
 
We compete with companies of all sizes in a variety of geographies that offer solutions that compete with single elements of our platform, such as regulatory compliance, armed security, armored transportation services and money processing. The security services industry is a large and competitive market. More specifically, however, the market for security and storage solutions as it pertains to medical marijuana companies is a nascent market, resulting in a highly fragmented and fractured marketplace. Some of the companies we compete with are much larger than us, and such companies have significantly greater resources than us. None of the large security companies, such as Brinks, Argyle, Tyco or Torment, are currently competing in this market segment, although there can be no guarantee this trend will continue.
 
Significantly all of our current and potential traditional competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer or user bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be able to secure experienced employees, accommodate customers more efficiently and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. Many of these current and potential competitors can devote substantially more resources to advertising, marketing and attracting experienced talent than we can. In addition, larger, more well-established and financed entities may acquire, invest in or form joint ventures with our competitors.
 
Government Regulation
 
In most jurisdictions we are required to obtain government approval to provide security and/or investigative services. We expect to make every effort to comply with all existing and pending regulatory conditions and licensing requirements in each state we currently or potentially operate in.
 
Continued development of the marijuana industry is dependent upon continued legislative authorization of marijuana at the state level. Any number of factors could slow or halt progress in this area. Further, progress, while encouraging, is not assured. While there may be ample public support for legislative action, numerous factors impact the legislative process. Any one of these factors could slow or halt use of marijuana, which would negatively impact our proposed business.

Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal laws. There are currently 29 states and the District of Columbia allowing its citizens to use Medical Marijuana. Additionally, 8 states and Washington D.C. have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The former Obama administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct law federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. However, the new Trump administration could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect our revenues and profits. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the Federal or state governments.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We are developing proprietary streamlined government-certified software capable of tracking all movements of cannabis products through to cash to taxes paid to deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank. The technology behind our software is being engineered and developed by subcontractors, and we consider it proprietary and confidential, and protected under trade secret laws. We have not sought to patent our aspect of this technology; however, we have not yet determined if we will seek to patent any aspect of the software in the future.
 
We plan to protect our proprietary and confidential information through a series of non-compete and non-disclosure contracts with our employees, contractors and other interested parties. The law of protection of confidential information effectively allows a perpetual monopoly in secret information, and it does not expire as would a patent. The lack of formal protection, however, means that a third party is not prevented from independently duplicating and using the secret information once it is discovered.
 
Number of total employees and number of full time employees
 
As of April 15, 2019, we had approximately 65 full and part-time employees, 90% of whom are former military or law enforcement professionals.
