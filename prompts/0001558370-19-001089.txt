 Overview
 The terms “B&G Foods,” “our,” “we” and “us,” as used in this report, refer to B&G Foods, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, except where it is clear that the term refers only to the parent company. Throughout this report, we refer to our fiscal years ended January 3, 2015, January 2, 2016, December 31, 2016, December 30, 2017, December 29, 2018 and December 28, 2019 as “fiscal 2014,” “fiscal 2015,” “fiscal 2016,” “fiscal 2017,” “fiscal 2018” and “fiscal 2019,” respectively. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53 week reporting period ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2014 contained 53 weeks and fiscal 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015 each contained or contain 52 weeks.
 B&G Foods manufactures, sells and distributes a diverse portfolio of branded, high quality, shelf‑stable and frozen food and household products across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Many of our branded products have leading regional or national market shares. In general, we position our products to appeal to the consumer desiring a high quality and reasonably priced product. We complement our branded product retail sales with institutional and foodservice sales and private label sales.
 B&G Foods, including our subsidiaries and predecessors, has been in business for over 125 years. We were incorporated in Delaware on November 25, 1996 under the name B Companies Holdings Corp.

 Food Industry
 The food industry is one of the United States’ largest industries. Historically, it has been characterized by relatively stable sales growth, based largely on price and population increases. In recent years, however, many traditional center of store grocery brands in the industry have often experienced flat to modestly declining sales. Over the past decade or so, the retail side of the food industry has seen a continuing shift of sales to alternate food outlets such as supercenters, warehouse clubs, organic and “natural” food stores, dollar stores, drug stores and e-tailers. Among other things, this shift has caused consolidation of traditional grocery chains into larger entities, often spanning the country under varying banner names. Consolidation has increased the importance of having a number one or two brand within a category, be that position national or regional. At the same time, this shift has also introduced many alternatives to traditional grocery chains. A broad sales and distribution infrastructure has also become critical for food companies, allowing them to reach all outlets selling food to consumers and expanding their growth opportunities. Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 Overview. We sell, market and distribute our products through a multiple‑channel sales, marketing and distribution system to all major U.S. food channels, including sales and shipments to supermarkets, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, wholesalers, foodservice distributors and direct accounts, specialty food distributors, military commissaries and non‑food outlets such as drug, dollar store chains and e-tailers. Certain of our brands, including Green Giant, Cream of Wheat, Back to Nature, Ac’cent, Crock Pot® seasoning mixes, Underwood, Polaner, Static Guard, Mrs. Dash, New York Style, Sugar Twin and Victoria are also distributed to similar food channels in Canada. We sell, market and distribute our household brand, Static Guard, through the same sales, marketing and distribution system to many of the same customers who buy our food products as well as to other household product retailers and distributors.
 We sell our products primarily through broker sales networks to supermarket chains, foodservice outlets, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, non‑food outlets and specialty distributors. The broker sales network handles the sale of our products at the retail level.

 Sales. Our sales organization is aligned by distribution channels and consists of regional sales managers, key account managers and sales persons. Regional sales managers sell our products nationwide through national and regional brokers, with separate organizations focusing on foodservice, grocery chain accounts and special markets. Our sales managers coordinate our broker sales efforts, make key account calls with buyers or distributors and supervise broker retail coverage of the products at the store level.
 Our sales strategy is centered on individual brands. We allocate promotional spending for each of our brands and our regional sales managers coordinate promotions with customers. Additionally, our marketing department works in conjunction with the sales department to coordinate special account activities and marketing support, such as couponing, public relations and media advertising.
 We have a national sales force that is capable of supporting our current brands and quickly integrating and supporting any newly acquired brands.
 Marketing. Our marketing organization is aligned by brand and is responsible for the strategic planning for each of our brands. We focus on deploying promotional dollars where we believe the spending will have the greatest impact on sales. Marketing and trade spending support, on a national basis, typically consists of advertising trade promotions, coupons and cross‑promotions with supporting products. Radio, internet, social media and limited television advertising supplement this activity.
 Distribution. We distribute our products through a multiple‑channel system that covers every class of customer nationwide. Due to the different demands of distribution for frozen and shelf-stable products, we maintain separate distribution systems. 
 Our shelf-stable distribution network consists of five primary locations, four of which are leased by us and are operated for us by a third party logistics provider, and one that is located at an owned manufacturing facility and is operated by us. In Canada, Mexico and from time to time in the United States we also use public warehouse and distribution facilities for our shelf-stable products.
 Our frozen distribution network consists of seven primary locations, which are owned and operated by third party logistics providers.
 We believe that our distribution systems for shelf‑stable and frozen products have sufficient capacity to accommodate incremental product volume. See Item 2, “Properties” for a listing of our owned and leased distribution centers and warehouses. During 2018, we were negatively impacted by industry-wide increases in the cost of distribution, primarily driven by freight costs. We expect this to continue in 2019. To date our sales price increases and cost savings initiatives have not been sufficient to fully offset these distribution cost increases. To the extent we are unable to offset present and future cost increases, our operating results will be negatively impacted.
 Customers
 Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 54.4% of our net sales and 54.8% of our end of the year receivables for fiscal 2018. Other than Walmart, which accounted for 23.1% of our fiscal 2018 net sales, no single customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our fiscal 2018 net sales. Other than Walmart, which accounted for 24.9% of our receivables as of the end of fiscal 2018, no single customer accounted for more than 10.0% of our receivables as of the end of fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, our net sales to foreign countries represented approximately 7.3%, 6.3% and 7.1%, respectively, of our total net sales. Our foreign sales are primarily to customers in Canada.  Seasonality
 Sales of a number of our products tend to be seasonal and may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons/weather or certain other annual events. In general, our sales are higher in the first and fourth quarters.
 We purchase most of the produce used to make our frozen and shelf‑stable canned vegetables, pickles, relishes, peppers, tomatoes and other related specialty items during the months of June through October, and we generally purchase the majority of our maple syrup requirements during the months of April through August. Consequently, our liquidity needs are greatest during these periods.

 Competition
 We face competition in each of our product lines. Numerous brands and products compete for shelf space and sales, with competition based primarily on product quality, convenience, price, trade promotion, consumer promotion, brand recognition and loyalty, customer service, advertising and other activities and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences. We compete with numerous companies of varying sizes, including divisions or subsidiaries of larger companies. Many of these competitors have multiple product lines, substantially greater financial and other resources and may have lower fixed costs and/or be substantially less leveraged than we are. Our ability to grow our business could be impacted by the relative effectiveness of, and competitive response to, our product initiatives, product innovation, advertising and promotional activities. In addition, from time to time, we experience margin pressure in certain markets as a result of competitors’ pricing practices.
 Our products compete not only against other brands in their respective product categories, but also against products in similar or related product categories. For example, our shelf‑stable pickles compete not only with other brands of shelf‑stable pickles, but also with pickle products found in the refrigerated sections of grocery stores, and all our brands compete against private label products to varying degrees.
 Raw Materials
 We purchase raw materials, including agricultural products, meat, poultry, flour, other raw materials, ingredients and packaging materials from growers, commodity processors, other food companies and packaging suppliers located in U.S. and foreign locations. The principal raw materials for our products include corn, peas, broccoli, beans, pepper, garlic and other spices, maple syrup, wheat, corn, nuts, cheese, fruits, beans, tomatoes, peppers, meat, sugar, concentrates, molasses and corn sweeteners. Vegetables for the Green Giant brand are primarily purchased under dedicated acreage supply contracts from a number of growers prior to each growing season with the remaining demand being sourced directly from third parties. We purchase certain other agricultural raw materials in bulk or pursuant to short‑term supply contracts. Most of our agricultural products are purchased between April 1 and October 31. We generally source pepper, garlic and other spices and herbs from locations other than the United States. We purchase the majority of our maple syrup from Canada. We also use packaging materials, particularly glass jars, cans, cardboard and plastic containers. The profitability of our business relies in substantial part on the prices we and our co‑packers pay for these raw materials and packaging materials, which can fluctuate due to a number of factors, including changes in crop size, national, state and local government sponsored agricultural programs, export demand, currency exchange rates, natural disasters, weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons, water supply, general growing conditions, the effect of insects, plant diseases and fungi, and glass, metal and plastic prices.
 Fluctuations in commodity prices can lead to retail price volatility and intensive price competition, and can influence consumer and trade buying patterns.
 The cost of labor, manufacturing, energy, fuel, packaging materials and other costs related to the production and distribution of our food products can from time to time increase significantly and unexpectedly. We attempt to manage these risks by entering into short‑term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements, implementing cost saving measures and raising sales prices. During the past three years, our cost saving measures and sales price increases have not been sufficient to fully offset increases to our raw material, ingredient and packaging costs. To the extent we are unable to offset present and future cost increases, our operating results will be negatively impacted.
 Production
 Manufacturing. We operate ten manufacturing facilities for our products. See Item 2, “Properties” for a listing of our manufacturing facilities.

 
  - 10 -

 

 Co-Packing Arrangements. In addition to our own manufacturing facilities, we source a significant portion of our products under “co‑packing” arrangements, a common industry practice in which manufacturing is outsourced to other companies. We regularly evaluate our co‑packing arrangements to ensure the most cost‑effective manufacturing of our products and to utilize company‑owned manufacturing facilities most effectively. Third parties located in U.S. and foreign locations produce our Back to Nature, Baker’s Joy, Bear Creek Country Kitchens, Canoleo, Cream of Rice, Crock Pot, Green Giant, JJ Flats, Joan of Arc, Le Sueur, MacDonald’s, McCann’s, New York Flatbreads, Regina, SnackWell’s, Spring Tree, Static Guard, Sugar Twin and TrueNorth products and certain B&G, Cary’s, Cream of Wheat, Emeril’s, Las Palmas and Ortega products under co‑packing agreements or purchase orders. Each of our co‑packers produces products for other companies as well. We believe that there are alternative sources of co‑packing production readily available for the majority of our products, although we may experience short‑term disturbances in our operations if we are required to change our co‑packing arrangements unexpectedly. Trademarks and Licensing Agreements
 Trademarks. We consider our trademarks, in the aggregate, to be material to our business. We protect our trademarks by registration in the United States, Canada and in other countries where we sell our products. We also oppose any infringement in key markets. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered. Registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. Examples of our trademarks and registered trademarks include Ac’cent, Back to Nature, B&G, B&G Sandwich Toppers, B&M, Baker’s Joy, Bear Creek Country Kitchens, Brer Rabbit, Canoleo, Cary’s, Cream of Rice, Cream of Wheat, Devonsheer, Don Pepino, Durkee, Emeril’s, Grandma’s, Green Giant, JJ Flats, Joan of Arc, Las Palmas, Le Sueur, MacDonald’s, Mama Mary’s, Maple Grove Farms of Vermont, McCann’s, Molly McButter, Mrs. Dash, New York Flatbreads, New York Style, Old London, Ortega, Polaner, Regina, Sa‑són, Sclafani SnackWell’s, Spice Islands, Spring Tree, Static Guard, Sugar Twin, Tone’s, Trappey’s, TrueNorth, Underwood, Vermont Maid, Victoria, Weber and Wright’s.
 Inbound License Agreements. From time to time we enter into inbound licensing agreements. For example, we sell our Emeril’s brand products pursuant to a license agreement with Sequential Brands Group, Cream of Wheat Cinnabon®, a co‑branded product, pursuant to a licensing agreement with Cinnabon, Inc., Crock Pot seasoning mixes pursuant to a licensing agreement with Sunbeam Products, Inc. dba Jarden Consumer Solutions, Weber seasonings and other flavor enhancers pursuant to a licensing agreement with Weber-Stephen Products LLC. French’s® seasoning mixes were sold pursuant to a licensing agreement with French’s Food Company LLC, but that licensing agreement was terminated effective June 30, 2018 and we no longer sell any French’s products.
 Outbound License Agreements. We also from time to time enter into outbound license agreements for our trademarks and other intellectual property. For example, the Green Giant trademark is licensed to third parties for use in connection with their sale of fresh produce in the United States and Europe. We also license the Green Giant name and related intellectual property to General Mills for use with its sale of frozen and shelf stable products in parts of Europe, Asia and in various other locations outside of the United States and Canada.

 Employees and Labor Relations
 As of December 29, 2018, our workforce consisted of 2,675 employees. Of that total, 2,322 employees were engaged in manufacturing, 131 were engaged in marketing and sales, 142 were engaged in warehouse and distribution and 80 were engaged in administration. Approximately 61% of our employees, located at five facilities in the United States and one facility in Mexico, are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The agreements covering employees at the five facilities in the United States, which vary in term depending on the location, expire on December 31, 2019 (Brooklyn, NY; United Food and Commercial Workers, Local No. 342), March 31, 2020 (Roseland, New Jersey; International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers of America, Local No. 863), April 5, 2020 (Ankeny, Iowa; International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local No. 238), March 27, 2021 (Stoughton, Wisconsin; Drivers, Salesmen, Warehousemen, Milk Processors, Cannery, Dairy Employees and Helpers Union, Local No. 695), and April 30, 2022 (Portland, Maine; Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, AFL‑CIO, Local No. 334). There are two unions representing employees at our facility in Mexico, (1) the Industrial Union of Stevedore Workers, Cargo Transport Operators and Similar from the Mexican Republic and (2) the Union of Agriculture Workers at the Service of the Region. Our collective bargaining agreements with these two unions do not expire, however, certain terms of the agreements must be reviewed periodically. The collective bargaining agreement covering our Brooklyn facility, which covers approximately 80 employees, is the only collective bargaining agreement expiring in the next twelve months. While we believe that our relations with our union employees are in general good, we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement for our Brooklyn facility on terms satisfactory to us, or at all, and without production interruptions, including labor stoppages. At this time, however, management does not expect that the outcome of these negotiations will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Government Regulation
 As a manufacturer and marketer of food and household products, our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the United States Department of Labor, the Environmental Protection Agency and various other federal, state, local and foreign authorities (including government authorities in Canada and Mexico) regarding the manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, labeling, sale and distribution of our products and the health and safety of our employees. Our manufacturing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state, local and foreign authorities. In addition, our meat processing operation in Portland, Maine is subject to daily inspection by the USDA.
 We are subject to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, labeling, packaging and safety of food. We are also subject to the U.S. Bio‑Terrorism Act of 2002 which imposes on us import and export regulations. Under the Bio‑Terrorism Act we are required, among other things, to provide specific information about the food products we ship into the United States and to register our manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities with the FDA.
 We believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all material governmental laws and regulations and maintain all material permits and licenses relating to our operations. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we are in full compliance with all such laws and regulations or that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations in a cost‑effective manner. Failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
 Environmental Matters
 Environmental Sustainability. As part of our commitment to being a good corporate citizen, we consider environmental sustainability to be an important strategic focus area. For instance, our manufacturing operations have a variety of initiatives in place to reduce energy usage, conserve water, improve wastewater management, reduce packaging and where possible use recycled and recyclable packaging. We continue to evaluate and modify our manufacturing and other processes on an ongoing basis to mitigate risk and further reduce our impact on the environment, conserve water and reduce waste.

 
  - 12 -

 

 Environmental Laws and Regulations. We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations in the normal course of business. We have not made any material expenditures during the last three fiscal years in order to comply with environmental laws or regulations. Based on our experience to date, we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (and liability for known environmental conditions) will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot predict what environmental laws or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted, nor can we predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with such environmental laws or regulations or to respond to such environmental claims.
