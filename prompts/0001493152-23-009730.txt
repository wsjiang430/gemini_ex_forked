Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on utilizing the Processa Regulatory Science Approach, including the principles associated with FDA’s Project Optimus Oncology initiative and the related FDA Draft Guidance, in the development of Next Generation Chemotherapy (NGC) oncology drug products. Our mission is to provide better treatment options than those that presently exist by extending a patient’s survival and/or improving a patient’s quality of life. This is achieved by taking FDA-approved, widely used oncology drugs or the cancer killing metabolites of these drugs and altering how they are metabolized and/or distributed in the body, including how they are distributed to the actual cancer cells.
 
Regulatory science was conceived in the early 1990s when the founders of Processa and other faculty at the University of Maryland worked with the FDA to develop multiple FDA Guidances. Over the last 30 years, two of our founders, Dr. David Young and Dr. Sian Bigora, have expanded the original regulatory science concept to include other factors, such as the principles of Project Optimus, that can affect the risk-benefit analyses that FDA conducts for every FDA drug approval. In fact, the principles of FDA’s Project Optimus have been used by Drs. Young and Bigora to identify and justify an “optimal” dosage regimen for a number of non-oncology FDA-approved drugs. The Processa Regulatory Science Approach and our past experience with the principles of Project Optimus differentiates us from other biotechnology companies by focusing us not only on the clinical science, but also on the equally important regulatory process. We believe utilizing the Processa Regulatory Science Approach provides us with three distinct advantages:
 

● | greater efficiencies (e.g., the right study design and study readouts); 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | greater possibility of drug approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; and
● | improvement over existing therapy and greater acceptance by patients/doctors. 

 
In January 2023, we announced our strategic prioritization to advance our pipeline of Next Generation Chemotherapy proprietary small molecule oncology drugs. By changing either the metabolism, distribution and/or elimination of already FDA-approved cancer drugs while maintaining the mechanism of how the drug kills cancer cells, we believe our three Next Generation Chemotherapy (NGC) treatments will provide improved safety-efficacy profiles when compared to their currently marketed counterparts - capecitabine, gemcitabine, and irinotecan. All future studies of these drugs are subject to availability of capital to conduct the trials.
 
The three NGC treatments in our pipeline are as follows: 
 

● | NGC-Capecitabine is a combination of PCS6422 and capecitabine. NGC-Capecitabine alters the metabolism of capecitabine without having any clinically meaningful biological effect itself. In clinical trials, NGC-Capecitabine has a safety profile different than capecitabine when administered by itself. Side effects, such as Hand-Foot Syndrome (HFS) and cardiotoxicity that typically occur in 50-70% of patients treated with capecitabine and caused by specific capecitabine metabolites that are not formed to any extent with NGC-Capecitabine, do not appear to be side effects associated with NGC-Capecitabine. These types of toxicities can result in decreased doses, interrupted doses or discontinuation of treatment with capecitabine. In addition, NGC-Capecitabine has been found to be greater than 50 times more potent than capecitabine based on the systemic exposure of the capecitabine metabolite 5-FU, which is metabolized to the cancer-killing metabolites. Like capecitabine, NGC-Capecitabine could be used to treat patients with various cancers, such as metastatic colorectal, gastrointestinal, breast, and pancreatic. We estimate at least 200,000 patients in the United States were diagnosed in 2022 with metastatic colorectal, gastrointestinal, breast, and pancreatic cancers. In mid-April of 2023, we are scheduled to begin discussions with the FDA regarding the design of our Phase 2B trial and Project Optimus in order to initiate the Phase 2B trial in the second half of 2023.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | NGC-Gemcitabine (also identified as PCS3117) is an oral analog of gemcitabine that is converted to its active metabolite by a different enzyme system than gemcitabine resulting in a positive response in gemcitabine patients as well as some gemcitabine treatment-resistant patients. Like gemcitabine, NGC-Gemcitabine could be used to treat patients with various cancers such as pancreatic, lung, ovarian, and breast. We estimate at least 275,000 patients in the United States were diagnosed in 2022 with pancreatic, lung, ovarian, and breast cancer. We plan to meet with the FDA in 2023 to discuss potential study designs including implementation of Project Optimus as part of the design, and then submit the Phase 2B protocol to the Investigational New Drug (IND Application) in the second half of 2023. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | NGC-Irinotecan (also identified as PCS11T) is a prodrug of the active metabolite of irinotecan (SN-38). The chemical structure of NGC-Irinotecan influences the uptake of the drug into cancer cells, resulting in more NGC-Irinotecan entering cancer cells than normal cells in mice. These levels were significantly greater than those seen with irinotecan, resulting in lower doses of NGC-Irinotecan having greater efficacy than irinotecan and improved safety in animal models. Like irinotecan, NGC-Irinotecan could be used to treat patients with various cancers such as lung, colorectal, gastrointestinal, and pancreatic cancer. We estimate at least 200,000 patients in the United States were diagnosed in 2022 with lung, colorectal, gastrointestinal, and pancreatic cancer. We plan to conduct IND-enabling and toxicology studies in 2023 and 2024.

 
Due to enrollment difficulties that we have experienced since the beginning of our rare disease trial for PCS499 in ulcerative Necrobiosis Lipoidica (uNL), we decided to suspend further enrollment in the PCS499 trial in February 2023. In addition, the clinical findings for PCS12852 were positive in gastroparesis patients and there were no safety concerns during the conduct of either the PCS12842 or PCS499 trials. With our focus on the NGCs in our pipeline, we are evaluating options to monetize PCS12852 and PCS499.

Our shift in prioritization of the products does not change our mission. We continue to be focused on drug products that improve the survival and/or quality of life for patients by improving the safety and/or efficacy of the drug in a targeted patient population, while providing a more efficient path to FDA approval, increasing the probability of FDA approval, and differentiating our drugs from those on the market or are currently being developed.
 
Historically, much of oncology drug development has searched for a new or different way to treat cancer. Our approach is to modify and improve three different, currently approved, and widely used chemotherapy treatments so that the human body handles these NGC treatments differently than their presently approved counterpart drugs while the cancer killing mechanism of action remains the same. FDA’s Project Optimus Oncology initiative and Oncology Guidance recommends that the dose-response (both safety and efficacy) relationships be evaluated for all oncology drugs. We have begun this process for our NGC treatments. To date, we have found that our NGC treatments are likely to have a better safety-efficacy profile than the current widely used marketed counterpart drugs, not only potentially making the development and approval process more efficient, but also differentiating our NGC treatments from the existing treatment. We believe our NGC treatments have the potential to extend the survival and/or quality of life for more patients diagnosed with cancer while decreasing the number of patients who are required to dose adjust or discontinue treatment because of side effects or lack of response.
 
Our Strategy
 
With the Processa Regulatory Science Approach, our strategy is to obtain and develop drugs that will not only treat patients with unmet medical need conditions, but also have the potential to be more efficiently developed with a greater probability of development success than what typically occurs in the biotech-pharma industry, as well as a better return on investment given more efficient development and high commercial value. We applied rigorous standards to identify drugs for our portfolio, the three most important being:

● | The drug must represent a treatment option to patients with a high unmet medical need condition by improving survival and/or quality of life for these patients, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The drug or its metabolite or a drug with similar pharmacological properties must have demonstrated some clinical evidence of efficacy in the target population, and 
● | The probability of approval and the efficiency of development for the drug will be improved using the Processa Regulatory Science Approach. 

 
Our rigorous requirement resulted in the in-licensing of five drugs: three NGC drugs and two non-oncology drugs. These clinical candidates had significant pre-clinical and clinical data that de-risked the programs.
 
In January 2023, we announced our plan to prioritize our team’s time and our capital resources on the continued development of our NGC drugs while exploring opportunities, including non-dilutive licensing, collaborations, and other strategic transactions, for our non-oncology drugs. By changing either the metabolism, distribution and/or elimination of FDA-approved drugs while still maintaining the mechanism of killing cancer cells, we believe that our three NGC treatments provide improved safety-efficacy profiles when compared to their currently marketed counterparts of capecitabine, gemcitabine and irinotecan. These modifications differentiate our NGC treatments from the existing therapies while being potential life-changing treatments for patients.
 
Our pipeline of NGCs (i) already have data demonstrating the desired pharmacological activity in humans or appropriate animal models and is able to provide improved safety and/or efficacy by some modification in the formation and/or distribution of the active moieties associated with the drug and (ii) target cancers for which a single positive pivotal study demonstrating efficacy might provide enough evidence that the clinical benefits of the drug and its approval outweighs the risks associated with the drug.

Our Team
 
Our drug development efforts are guided by our knowledge and experience in applying the Processa Regulatory Science Approach to decrease manageable risks, costs, and time toward achieving marketing authorization from regulatory authorities including the FDA. We have assembled a seasoned management team and development team with extensive experience in developing therapies, including advancing product candidates from preclinical research through clinical development and ultimately regulatory approval and commercialization. Our team is led by our CEO and Founder David Young, Pharm.D., Ph.D. who has extensive experience in research, regulatory approval and business development and who served at Questcor Pharmaceuticals for eight years, initially as an independent director and subsequently as its Chief Scientific Officer.
 
To execute our strategy, we assembled an experienced and development team with a successful track record of drug approvals and successful exits. Our team is experienced in developing drug products through all principal regulatory tiers from IND-enabling studies to New Drug Application (NDA) submission. Throughout their careers, the combined scientific, development and regulatory experiences of our team members have resulted in more than 30 drug approvals in indications reviewed by almost every division of the FDA including the oncology divisions, over 100 meetings with the FDA and involvement with more than 50 drug development programs, including drug products targeted to patients who have an unmet medical need and cancer patients. In addition, the FDA Project Optimus Oncology initiative and recent FDA Oncology Guidance applies the Processa Regulatory Science Approach and principles used and refined by our Founders over the last 30 years.
 
Our Drug Pipeline
 
Our pipeline currently consists of three oncology drugs (NGC-Capecitabine, NGC-Gemcitabine and NGC-Irinotecan previously identified as PCS6422, PCS3117 and PCS11T, respectively) and two non-oncology drugs (PCS12852 and PCS499). A timeline and summary of each drug is provided below.

Next Generation Chemotherapy Pipeline
 

● | Next Generation Capecitabine (NGC-Capecitabine), also identified as PCS6422, is a combination of PCS6422 and the FDA-approved cancer drug capecitabine. NGC-Capecitabine is an orally administered irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). DPD metabolizes 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), the major metabolite of capecitabine and widely used itself as an intravenous chemotherapeutic agent in many types of cancer, to multiple metabolites classified as catabolites. These catabolites do not have any cancer-killing properties but frequently cause dose-limiting side effects that may require dose adjustments or discontinuation of therapy. When combining capecitabine with PCS6422 in NGC-Capecitabine, PCS6422 significantly changes the metabolism and distribution of 5-FU. After formation from capecitabine, 5-FU is metabolized to anabolites (which kill both cancer cells and normal duplicating cells) and catabolites (which cause side effects and have no cancer killing properties). Due to this change in metabolism of capecitabine and the change in the overall metabolite profile of anabolites and catabolites, the side effect and efficacy profile of NGC-Capecitabine has been found to be different than the existing FDA-approved capecitabine. Since the potency of NGC-Capecitabine is also more potent than FDA-approved capecitabine based on the 5-FU systemic exposure per mg of capecitabine administered, the amount of capecitabine anabolites formed from 1 mg of capecitabine administered in NGC-Capecitabine will, therefore, be much greater than formed from the administration of 1 mg of existing capecitabine. On August 2, 2021, we enrolled the first patient in our Phase 1B dose-escalation maximum tolerated dose trial in patients with advanced refractory gastrointestinal (GI) tract tumors. Our interim analysis of Cohorts 1 and 2A of the ongoing clinical trial found no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), no drug-related adverse events greater than Grade 1, and no adverse events associated with the catabolites of 5-FU such as HFS. In this Phase 1B trial, it was demonstrated that the irreversible inhibition of DPD by PCS6422 could alter the metabolism, distribution and elimination of 5-FU, making NGC-Capecitabine significantly more potent than capecitabine alone (greater than 50x more potent) and potentially leading to higher levels of anabolites which can kill replicating cancer and normal cells. By administering NGC-Capecitabine to cancer patients, the balance between anabolites and catabolites changes depending on the dosage regimens of PCS6422 and capecitabine used, making the efficacy-safety profile of NGC-Capecitabine different than that of FDA-approved capecitabine and requiring further evaluation of the PCS6422 and capecitabine regimens to determine the optimal NGC-Capecitabine regimens for patients. In order for NGC-Capecitabine to provide a safer and more efficacious profile for cancer patients compared to existing chemotherapy, understanding how the different regimens of PCS6422 and capecitabine may affect the systemic and tumor exposure to the anabolites, as well as the systemic exposure to the catabolites, is required. This can be achieved by following the timeline of DPD irreversible inhibition and the formation of new DPD using the plasma concentrations of 5-FU and its catabolites. In an effort to better estimate the timeline of DPD inhibition and formation of new DPD, we modified the protocol for the Phase 1B trial and began enrolling patients in the amended Phase 1B trial in April 2022. On November 1, 2022, we announced that data from the Phase 1B trial identified multiple dosage regimens with potentially better safety and efficacy profiles than currently existing chemotherapy regimens. Since 5-FU exposure is dependent on both the PCS6422 regimen and the capecitabine regimen, safe regimens were identified as well as regimens that cause DLTs. One of the regimens in the Phase 1B trial did cause DLTs in two patients, one of whom died. The Phase 1B study is continuing to enroll patients and is expected to complete enrollment in 2023. The next study will be a Phase 2B trial to determine which regimens provide an improved efficacy-safety profile over present therapy using the principles of the FDA’s Project Optimus initiative to help guide the design of the trial. This FDA initiative requires us to consider NGC regimens that are not at the maximum tolerated dose or exposure level. In mid-April of 2023, we are scheduled to begin discussions with FDA regarding the design of our Phase 2B trial and Project Optimus in order to initiate the Phase 2B trial in the second half of 2023. We will need to obtain additional funding before we can conduct this trial.

● | NGC-Gemcitabine, also identified as PCS3117, is a cytidine analog similar to gemcitabine (Gemzar®), but different enough in chemical structure that some patients are more likely to respond to PCS3117 than gemcitabine. The difference in response occurs because NGC-Gemcitabine is metabolized to its active metabolite through a different enzyme system than gemcitabine. We continue to evaluate the potential use of NGC-Gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer and to evaluate ways to identify patients who are more likely to respond to NGC-Gemcitabine than gemcitabine. We plan to meet with the FDA in 2023 to discuss potential study designs including implementation of the FDA’s Project Optimus initiative as part of the design and then submit the Phase 2B protocol to the IND.

● | NGC-Irinotecan, also identified as PCS11T, is an analog of SN38 (SN38 is the active metabolite of irinotecan) and should have an improved safety/efficacy profile in every type of cancer that irinotecan is presently used. The manufacturing process and sites for drug substance and drug product are presently being evaluated and IND-enabling toxicology studies will then be initiated. In addition, we are defining the potential paths to approval, which include defining the targeted patient population and the type of cancer. We plan to conduct IND enabling and toxicology studies in 2023 and 2024, subject to available funding. 

 
Non-Oncology Pipeline for Out-licensing or Partnership
 
● | PCS12852 is a highly specific and potent 5HT4 agonist that has already been evaluated in clinical studies in South Korea for gastric emptying and gastrointestinal motility in healthy volunteers and volunteers with a history of constipation. In October 2021, the FDA cleared our IND application to proceed with a Phase 2A trial for the treatment of gastroparesis. We enrolled our first patient on April 5, 2022 and completed enrollment of the trial on September 2, 2022. Results from this Phase 2A study which included 25 patients with moderate to severe gastroparesis, demonstrated improvements in gastric emptying in patients receiving 0.5 mg of PCS12852 as compared to placebo. The results indicated that for the patients in the PCS12852 group, the mean time for 50% of the gastric contents to empty (t50) compared to their baseline value (±SD) decreased by -31.90 min (±50.53) (compared to the change seen in the placebo group of only -9.36 min (±42.43). Significant gastric emptying differences were not observed between the placebo and the 0.1 mg dose. Adverse events associated with the administration of PCS12852 were generally mild to moderate as expected, limited in duration, and quickly resolved without any sequelae. There were no clinically significant cardiovascular safety events or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported during the study. Additionally, the 0.5 mg of PCS12852 showed a greater improvement than placebo in the gastroparesis symptomology scales (including both total scores in the scales, as well as sub-scores such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain) used in the study. With the study now complete, we have the data necessary to finalize the development plan for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis patients. We plan to monetize PCS12852 by looking for licensing and/or partnering opportunities. 


● | PCS499 is an oral tablet of the deuterated analog of one of the major metabolites of pentoxifylline (PTX or Trental®). PCS499 is a drug that can be used to treat unmet medical need conditions caused by multiple pathophysiological changes. We completed a Phase 2A trial for PCS499 in patients with ulcerative and non-ulcerative necrobiosis lipoidica (uNL and NL, respectively) in late 2020, and in May 2021, we enrolled the first patient in our Phase 2B trial for the treatment of uNL. Although we initiated several recruitment programs to increase the enrollment of patients in this study, we were only able to recruit four patients. We will complete the study for those currently enrolled, but will halt further efforts to enroll new patients for our PCS499 Phase 2B uNL trial. We have experienced extremely slow enrollment in the trial given the extreme rarity of the condition (rarer than reported in the literature), the impact of COVID-19, and the reluctance of patients to be in a clinical trial. There have been no safety concerns during the conduct of the trial. Although we believe that PCS499 can be effective in treating uNL, in late February 2023, we received preliminary data that indicated that the placebo response is likely much greater than the literature and clinical experts believe; thus, a much larger sample size would be required in a pivotal trial for an indication where it was extremely difficult to enroll even 10 patients. We are also evaluating other, less rare indications for PCS499. As with PCS12852, we plan to monetize PCS499 by looking for licensing and/or partnership opportunities.

Manufacturing and Clinical Supplies
 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on multiple third-party contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for the supply of current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)-grade clinical trial materials and commercial quantities of our product candidates and products, if approved. We require all of our CMOs to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with cGMP. We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the necessary technical, quality and regulatory oversight of our CMOs.
 
We anticipate that these CMOs will have the capacity to support both clinical supply and commercial-scale production, but we do not have any formal agreements at this time with any of these CMOs to cover commercial production.
 
We also may elect to pursue additional CMOs for manufacturing supplies of drug substance and finished drug product in the future. We believe that our standardized manufacturing process can be transferred to a number of other CMOs for the production of clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates in the ordinary course of business.
 
Competition
 
Many of our potential competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, a more established presence in the market, and more expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These potential competitors may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
The key competitive factors affecting each of our products, if approved, are likely to include the efficacy, safety, convenience and price of the products relative to other approved products used on- or off-label for each unmet medical need condition. Although preliminary clinical data exists to support the possibility of improved efficacy and safety profiles for our drugs, more in-depth randomized, controlled studies are required for our products to determine if our preliminary findings will support the approval in the designated unmet medical need indication.
 
For NGC-Capecitabine, the competitive factors will be related to the efficacy and safety of the product when used in combination with existing cytotoxic drugs such as capecitabine and fluoropyrimidines compared to the efficacy and safety when these cytotoxic agents are administered without PCS6422 or with reversible enzyme inhibitors. The market penetration will depend on how much improvement will occur in the efficacy and/or safety profiles when administered in combination with PCS6422. Currently, there are no other reversible or irreversible enzyme inhibitor products approved in the US and no irreversible enzyme inhibitors approved ex-US, which may make PCS6422 the first DPD irreversible inhibitor available.
 
For NGC-Gemcitabine, the competitive factors will include establishing market penetration against other cytidine analogues, such as gemcitabine, which is currently used as first or second line chemotherapy either alone or in combination with other chemotherapy agents. The market penetration will depend on the potential for an improved efficacy profile in patients who have developed tolerance to other agents.
 
For NGC-Irinotecan, the competitive factors will include establishing marketing penetration against the existing irinotecan product (Camptosar®) and the newer liposomal irinotecan product (Onivyde®). The establishment of that market will be based upon improved efficacy and/or safety of NGC-Irinotecan.
 
For PCS12852, the competitive factors will include establishing marketing penetration against the metoclopramide products (the only approved drug to treat gastroparesis) and other 5-HT4 receptor agonists used off label. The market penetration will depend on the potential for an improved safety profile due to the very selective 5-HT4 receptor binding by PCS12852 and similar or greater efficacy in the treatment of gastroparesis.
 
For PCS499, there are currently no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of patients with NL, and few drugs are used off-label for NL given the lack of efficacy and/or side effect concerns.
 
Our commercial opportunity for any of our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less expensive, more convenient or easier to administer, or have fewer or less severe side effects, than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

Intellectual Property
 
Our success will depend in large part on our ability and that of our licensors to:
 

● | obtain and maintain international and domestic patent and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | prosecute and defend our future patents, once obtained; 
● | preserve confidentiality of our own and our licensed methods, processes and know-how; and 
● | operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties. 

 
Although we rely extensively on licensing patents from third parties, we intend to seek appropriate patent protection for product candidates in our research and development programs, where applicable, and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected countries. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for compositions of matter, medical uses, processes for preparation and formulations.
 
Our current patent portfolio consists of the number of patents related to our drug candidates licensed from each third-party licensor. In addition to the international patents and/or international and U.S. patent applications licensed from our third-party licensors, we have licensed at least the following number of U.S. patents:
 

 | CoNCERT | Yuhan | Aposense | Elion | Ocuphire | Total
-------------+---------+-------+----------+-------+----------+------
U.S. patents | 9 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 6 | 25 

 
A provisional patent for NGC-Capecitabine has been filed.
 
Besides relying on patents, we may also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. In addition, we continuously evaluate opportunities to obtain exclusivity through our regulatory filings with the FDA. We seek protection of these trade secrets, proprietary know-how and any continuing innovation, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for, or adequate remedies to protect, our technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors.

License Agreements
 
The following descriptions of our license agreements are only summaries. You should also refer to the copies of such agreements which have been filed as exhibits to this Annual Report.
License Agreement with Elion Oncology, Inc.
 
On August 23, 2020, we entered into a condition precedent License Agreement with Elion Oncology (“Elion License Agreement”), pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize PCS6422 globally. The grant of license was conditioned on the following being satisfied by October 30, 2020: (i) our closing on an equity financing of at least $15 million in gross proceeds and (ii) successful up-listing to Nasdaq.
 
On October 6, 2020, all conditions were satisfied, resulting in the addition of PCS6422 to our portfolio, and we paid $100,000 cash and issued 825,000 shares of our common stock to Elion. Such shares were subject to a lock-up, with 50% of such shares released from such lock-up after six months and the remaining 25% tranches were released following 9 months and 12 months, respectively.
 
As part of the Elion License Agreement, we agreed to issue to Elion 100,000 shares of our common stock on each of the first and second anniversary dates of the Elion License Agreement, which we fulfilled on October 5, 2021 and 2022, respectively.
 
As additional consideration, we will pay Elion development and regulatory milestone payments (a portion of which are payable in shares of our common stock and a portion of which are payable in cash) upon the achievement of certain milestones, which include FDA or other regulatory approval and dosing a patient. In addition, we must pay Elion one-time sales milestone payments based on the achievement during a calendar year of one or more thresholds for annual sales for products made and pay royalties based on annual licensing sales. We are also required to split any milestone payments received with Elion based on any sub-license agreement we may enter into.
 
On May 17, 2022, we amended the third Milestone Event of Section 6.4 of our License Agreement with Elion Oncology, Inc. changing the third Milestone Event from “1st Patient in Dose Confirmation Study” to (a) determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or (b) determination of the recommended Phase 2 Dose. Prior to this amendment, the third milestone was not considered probable since it was unknown when, or if a dose confirmation study was going to be conducted. As a result of the modification, we consider it probable that the recommended Phase 2 dosage regimen could be determined in connection with our current Phase 1B trial for PCS6422. We recorded an expense and related liability of $189,000 representing the value of the shares we anticipate issuing to Elion at the fair value on the date of modification.

Government Regulation
 
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 


● | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB), at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (GCP) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
● | submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and 
● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) or to conduct a post-approval study.

Pre-clinical studies
 
Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, including our product candidates, the product candidate must undergo rigorous pre-clinical testing. The pre-clinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, to assess the potential for adverse events and, in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of pre-clinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term pre-clinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions before that time related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 
Clinical trials
 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by, or under control of, the trial sponsor, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research patients provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. The goal of the Phase 2 trial is to also determine the “best” dosage regimen(s) to evaluate in the Phase 3 trial. The “best” regimen(s) means the regimen(s) that is(are) most likely to provide a safe-efficacious regimen that appropriately balances the risk-benefit analysis that the FDA is required to evaluate in each drug approval. The ideal way to define this “best” regimen for FDA is to evaluate the adverse event-drug exposure and efficacy-drug exposure relationships, which has also been previously called dose-response relationships or studies, and which has now become the foundation for both the FDA’s Project Optimus Oncology initiative and the draft Guidance to determine the optimal dose for an oncology drug. 
● | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a larger number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. 

 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a biologics license application (BLA).
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time, or the FDA may impose other sanctions on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can refuse, suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional pre-clinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

Marketing Approval
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee.
 
The review process typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review before accepting them for “filing.” The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the current guidelines in effect in the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has a goal to review and act on the submission within ten months from the completion of the preliminary review of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 
The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical trials or pre-clinical studies in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 
Orphan drug designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers.
 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, by providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication that could be used “off-label” by physicians in the orphan indication, even though the competitor’s product is not approved in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do of the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking, or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union, or EU, has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.

Expedited review and approval
 
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
 
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 
Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.

Post-approval requirements
 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are also continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
● | safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warning or other safety information about the product; 
● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.

Other Regulatory Matters
 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments.
 
For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. These laws include the following:
 

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA), provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | federal civil and criminal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 


● | the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
● | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; 
● | the FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices; 
● | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and

Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
 
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

European Union Drug Development
 
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the European Union Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (NCA) and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). Under the current regime, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. In the meantime, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU.
 
European Union Drug Review and Approval
 
In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 26 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of marketing authorizations:

● | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.

● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the European Union, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SmPC), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).

Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Similar to the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of patent protection due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval.

Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis.
 
Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
The United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA was passed in March 2010 which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs.

The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the HHS Secretary as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Effective April 1, 2020, Medicaid rebate liability will be expanded to include the territories of the United States as well. Additionally, for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer.
 
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, at the federal level, there is a “Blueprint” to lower prescription drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 
Moreover, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
