ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

 
On December 31, 2018 Pure Harvest Cannabis Producers, Inc. (“PHC”) was acquired by the Company. At the time of the acquisition, the Company had 6,808,657 outstanding shares of common stock. The Company issued 8,953,008 shares of its common stock, as well as warrants to purchase an additional 8,953,008 shares of the Company’s common stock to the shareholders of PHC in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of PHC. The warrants issued to the former shareholders of PHC allow the holder to acquire one share of the Company’s common stock at a price of $8.00 per share at any time on or before December 31, 2021. PHC is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
On February 5, 2019 the Company changed its name to Pure Harvest Cannabis Group, Inc. On March 15, 2019 shareholders owning a majority of the Company’s outstanding shares approved a two-for-one forward split of the Company’s common stock. The name change and forward stock split will become effective in the public market on a date determined by FINRA.
 
As a result of the acquisition of PHC the Company’s new business plan includes the acquisition of licensed medical and recreational marijuana dispensaries, cultivation facilities and production facilities in states which allow publicly traded companies to own and operate dispensaries, cultivation facilities and production facilities. Depending on the markets entered and state regulation, the Company’s plan may also include: asset purchases, management/consulting operating agreements, or similar allowable agreements. The Company plans to use a combination of cash, shares of common or preferred stock, notes, or other financing vehicles to complete these acquisitions.
 
As an alternative to a standard acquisition, the Company may use joint ventures and/or licensing arrangements to provide the Company with the same economic benefits as would be obtained from an outright acquisition.
 
The Company is dedicated to the research and development of the highest quality products to support patient health and well-being. The Company intends to develop into a large vertically integrated producer and distributor of cannabis initially targeting states with attractive markets that have legalized cannabis for both medicinal and adult-use. The Company will also enter markets that are in various stages of legalization with branded hemp derived CBD and terpene infused product lines. In addition to products tailored to marijuana retail dispensaries, the Company’s line will incorporate infused product options including beverages, edibles, topicals, concentrates, and distillates.
 
The Company is evaluating longer term supply chain opportunities of high quality lower cost cannabinoid oils and derivatives and has determined that the nation of Colombia is a market that can over time both supply raw ingredients for the Company’s domestic and international Pure Harvest branded product requirements, and become a low cost exporter globally to other countries seeking to purchase cannabis oil wholesale for their local market needs. (See LOI terms below).

The Company’s goals include establishing the Company as an iconic consumer product brand that can be sold across multiple markets that have legalized cannabis and hemp-derived products either partially or fully. The Company’s products will include the highest quality natural ingredients to become synonymous with products consumers trust and rely on for active and healthy lifestyles.
 
The Company plans to:
 

● | acquire up to 300,000 SF of cannabis cultivation and production facilities; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | develop a plant science and research hub; 
● | acquire up to 30 dispensaries with potential for delivery and consumption lounges; 
● | develop a multi-state branding strategy to achieve national and global exposure and recognition. 

 
For the most part, the Company will look to acquire established marijuana dispensaries or cultivation facilities (“target companies”) with annual revenues ranging between $4,000,000 and $20,000,000.
 
The Company anticipates that the marijuana dispensaries and cultivation facilities it will target will cost between $4,000,000 and $20,000,000 or approximately 1.0x annual revenues.
 
The acquisition of a target company will be approved by the board of directors. The Company will not call a meeting of shareholders to approve the acquisition of a target company. Shareholders will not be entitled to dissenters’ rights in connection with the acquisition of a target company.
 
The Company may acquire companies that may be financially unstable or in their early stages of development or growth, which would subject the Company to the numerous risks inherent in such companies.
 
The Company is not prohibited from pursuing a business combination with a target that is affiliated with its officers or directors, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with its officers or directors. In the event the Company plans to complete a business combination with a target that is affiliated with our executive officers or directors, the Company will not be required, to obtain an opinion from an independent firm that the business combination is fair to the Company from a financial point of view.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, the Company expects to conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with management and employees of the target business, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in the Company’s incurring losses and will reduce the funds the Company can use to complete another business combination.

On January 11, 2019 we signed a Non-Binding Letter of Intent with a corporation (the “Colombian Corp.”) formed under the laws of the Republic of Colombia to establish a Joint Venture in Colombia, South American. The Joint Venture, in which we will hold a 50% interest, will be formed for the purpose growing, harvesting, extracting, exporting, and selling cannabis. In return for our 50% interest in the Joint Venture, we will be responsible for providing up to $2,500,000 in funding for the Joint Venture’s initial operations. The Colombian Corp. will contribute 200 hectares of land to the Joint Venture, which will be used to grow cannabis which will be used to produce oils for export.
 
It is estimated that additional funding up to approximately $20,000,000 will be needed for the construction of greenhouses, providing infrastructure, water and electricity, and the construction of a processing facility.
 
On January 15, 2019 we signed a Non-Binding Letter of Intent with an unrelated third party to acquire the assets of a licensed marijuana dispensary located west of Denver, Colorado. The acquisition is subject to the approval by the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Colorado Department of Revenue. The Letter of Intent provides that we will pay $280,000 in cash, assume certain liabilities plus 1,250,000 restricted shares of our pre-split common stock for the assets that are purchased.
 
On January 26, 2019 we signed a Non-Binding Letter of Intent with an unrelated third party to acquire the assets of a licensed marijuana cultivation facility located in Denver, Colorado. The acquisition is subject to the approval by the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Colorado Department of Revenue. The Letter of Intent provides that we will pay $400,000 in cash, assume certain liabilities, and issue 1,000,000 restricted shares of our pre-split common stock for the assets that are purchased.
 
On February 17, 2019 we signed a Non-Binding Letter of Intent with unrelated third parties to acquire a 51% interest in a California corporation which plans to develop a CBD oil infused yerba mate beverage. The Letter of Intent provides that we will pay $400,000 in cash and issue 500,000 restricted shares of our pre-split common stock for a 51% interest in the California corporation. If the acquisition is completed, we have the option to acquire an additional 30% interest in the California corporation for $1,500,000. As of April 15, 2019, the California corporation was in the start-up stage and had not generated any revenue.
 
The non-binding Letters of Intent which we have signed do not prevent the other parties from entering into Letters of Intents or binding agreements with third parties.
 
The acquisition of marijuana dispensaries in Colorado, or other jurisdictions, is subject to the approval of government authorities which license and regulate marijuana dispensaries in their applicable jurisdictions. No assurance can be given that any such approvals can be obtained.
 
As of April 15, 2019, we had not acquired any dispensaries, cultivation facilities or any other entities and did not have any definitive agreements relating to any acquisition. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors in this offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business which we may acquire, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.

Market Conditions
 
Legal marijuana sales in North America reached $9.2 billion in 2017, according to ArcView Market Research/BDS Analytics. The research firm projects sales to increase to $24.5 billion by 2021.
 
Adult-Use marijuana is now legal in 10 states and the District of Colombia, and medical marijuana is legal in 33 states and the District of Columbia.
 
While the industry is growing rapidly, the cannabis industry faces three major obstacles that challenge its growth and profitability. First, the cultivation of cannabis is a very capital-intensive enterprise. Many cannabis entrepreneurs do not have access to the capital required to build the infrastructure required to meet growing demand and sales projections. Traditional sources of financing, such as banks, are not available currently to cannabis producers and retailers. Second, there is shortage of knowledge related to virtually all areas of the cannabis business. When new states are added to the list of regulated cannabis markets, there may be a scarcity of experience and expertise to serve the needs of growers and retailers in these states. Third, as explained below, marijuana is illegal under federal law.
Government Regulation
 
Cannabis is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. However, the Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
As of April 15, 2019, 33 states and the District of Colombia allowed their citizens to use Medical Marijuana. Additionally, 10 states, the District of Colombia and the country of Canada have legalized cannabis for recreational use by adults. However, the state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level.
 
The previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. In this regard, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA.
 
The Cole Memo noted that the Department of Justice is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provided guidance to Department of Justice attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following in preventing:
 

● | the distribution of cannabis to minors; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; 
● | the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;

-


● | state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 
● | drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; 
● | the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and 
● | cannabis possession or use on federal property. 

 
On January 4, 2018, the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the Sessions Memo stating that the Cole Memo was rescinded effectively immediately. In particular, Mr. Sessions stated that “prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,” which require “federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” Mr. Sessions went on to state in the memorandum that “previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.”
 
It is unclear at this time whether the Sessions Memo indicates that the Trump administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement.
 
However, on March 23, 2018 President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion budget bill that includes a provision that prevents the Justice Department, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, from using funds to arrest or prosecute patients, caregivers, and businesses that are acting in compliance with state medical marijuana laws. This provision, known as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to interfere with state medical marijuana programs.
 
During the confirmation hearings of new Attorney General William Barr, he made comments that he wouldn’t prosecute marijuana businesses operating within state law. Additionally, in April of 2019 Mr. Barr stated that he would prefer that Congress enact legislation allowing states to legalize marijuana instead of continuing the current approach under which a growing number of states have ended cannabis prohibition in conflict with federal law. The above notwithstanding, there can be no assurance that the Federal government will not seek to uphold federal law and supersede state law to prosecute cannabis companies.
