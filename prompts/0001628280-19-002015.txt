Operating Segments
We operate within two reportable segments: Regulated Energy and Unregulated Energy. The remainder of our operations is presented as “Other businesses and eliminations." These segments are described below in detail.    
Regulated Energy
Our regulated energy businesses are comprised of natural gas and electric distribution as well as natural gas transmission services. The following table presents net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 and total assets as of December 31, 2018, for the Regulated Energy segment by operation and area served:

Operations | Areas Served | Net Income | | Total Assets
(in thousands) | | | | 
Natural Gas Distribution | | | | 
Delmarva Natural Gas (Delaware division, Maryland division and Sandpiper Energy) | Delaware/Maryland | $ | 11,390 | | | $ | 211,458
Central Florida Gas and FPU | Florida | 11,754 | | | 312,769 | 
Natural Gas Transmission | | | | 
Eastern Shore | Delaware/Maryland/Pennsylvania | 17,460 | | | 262,918 | 
Peninsula Pipeline | Florida | 4,303 | | | 20,493 | 
Electric Distribution | | | | 
FPU | Florida | 2,249 | | | 123,863 | 
Total Regulated Energy | | $ | 47,156 | | | $ | 931,501

Revenues in this operating segment are based on rates regulated by the PSC in the states in which we operate or, in the case of Eastern Shore, which is an interstate business, by the FERC. The rates are designed to generate revenues to recover all prudent operating and financing costs and provide a reasonable return for our stockholders. Each of our distribution and transmission operations has a rate base, which generally consists of the original cost of the operation's plant, less accumulated depreciation, working capital and other assets. For Delmarva Natural Gas and Eastern Shore, rate base also includes deferred income tax liabilities and other additions or deductions. Our Regulated Energy operations in Florida do not include deferred income tax liabilities in their rate base.

Our natural gas and electric distribution operations bill customers at standard rates approved by their respective state PSC. Each state PSC allows us to negotiate rates, based on approved methodologies, for large customers that can switch to other fuels. Some of our customers in Maryland receive propane through our underground distribution system in Worcester County, which we are in the process of converting to natural gas. We bill these customers under PSC-approved rates and include them in the natural gas distribution results and customer statistics.
Our natural gas and electric distribution operations earn profits on the delivery of natural gas or electricity to customers. The cost of natural gas or electricity that we deliver is passed through to customers under PSC-approved fuel cost recovery mechanisms. The mechanisms allow us to adjust our rates on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to recover changes in the cost of the natural gas and electricity that we purchase for customers. Therefore, while our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of natural gas or electricity we purchase, our distribution margin (which we define as operating revenues less purchased gas or electric cost) is generally not impacted by fluctuations in the cost of natural gas or electricity. 
Our natural gas transmission operations bill customers under rate schedules approved by the FERC or at rates negotiated with customers.

(1) Eastern Shore's and Peninsula Pipeline's service to our local distribution affiliates is based on the respective regulator's approved rates and is an integral component of the cost associated with providing natural gas supplies for those affiliates. We eliminate operating revenues of these entities against the cost of sales of those affiliates in our consolidated financial information; however, our local distribution affiliates include this amount in their purchased fuel cost and recover it through fuel cost recovery mechanisms.
(2) Operating revenues from "Other" sources are from the rental of gas properties and reserve for rate case refund.
Regulatory Overview
The following table highlights key regulatory information for each of our principal Regulated Energy operations. The table reflects rate increases and rates of return approved prior to the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Note 19, Rates and Other Regulatory Activities and Note 12, Income Taxes in the consolidated financial statements) for further discussion on the impact of this legislation on our regulated businesses. Peninsula Pipeline is not regulated with regard to cost of service by either the Florida PSC or FERC and is therefore excluded from the table.

Weather
Weather variations directly influence the volume of natural gas and electricity sold and delivered to residential and commercial customers for heating and cooling and changes in volumes delivered impact the revenue generated from these customers. Natural gas volumes are highest during the winter months, when residential and commercial customers use more natural gas for heating. Demand for electricity is highest during the summer months, when more electricity is used for cooling. We measure the relative impact of weather using degree-days. A degree-day is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls above or below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Each degree of temperature below 65 degrees Fahrenheit is counted as one heating degree-day, and each degree of temperature above 65 degrees Fahrenheit is counted as one cooling degree-day. Normal heating and cooling degree-days are based on the most recent 10-year average.
Competition
Natural Gas Distribution
While our natural gas distribution operations do not compete directly with other distributors of natural gas for residential and commercial customers in our service areas, we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and alternative fuel providers for sales to industrial customers. Large customers could bypass our natural gas distribution systems and connect directly to interstate transmission pipelines, and we compete in all aspects of our natural gas business with alternative energy sources, including electricity, oil, propane and renewables. The most effective means to compete against alternative fuels are lower prices, superior reliability and flexibility of service. Natural gas historically has maintained a price advantage in the residential, commercial and industrial markets, and reliability of natural gas supply and service has been excellent. In addition, we provide flexible pricing to our large customers to minimize fuel switching and protect these volumes and their contributions to the profitability of our natural gas distribution operations. 
Natural Gas Transmission
Our natural gas transmission business competes with other pipeline companies to provide service to large industrial, generating and distribution customers, primarily in the northern portion of Delmarva and in Florida.
Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2018 Form 10-K Page  5

Electric Distribution
While our electric distribution operations do not compete directly with other distributors of electricity for residential and commercial customers in our service areas, we do compete with other electricity suppliers and alternative fuel providers for sales to industrial customers. Some of our large industrial customers may be capable of generating their own electricity, and we structure rates, flexibility and service offerings to retain these customers in order to retain their business and contributions to the profitability of our electric distribution operations. 
Supplies, Transmission and Storage
Natural Gas Distribution
Our natural gas distribution operations purchase natural gas from marketers and producers and maintain contracts for transportation and storage with several interstate pipeline companies to meet projected customer demand requirements. We believe that our supply and capacity strategy will adequately meet our customers’ needs over the next several years. 
The Delmarva natural gas distribution systems are directly connected to Eastern Shore’s pipeline, which has connections to the other pipelines that provide us with transportation and storage. These operations can also use propane-air and liquefied natural gas peak-shaving equipment to serve customers. Our Delmarva operations receive a fee, which we share with our customers, from our natural gas marketing subsidiary, PESCO, who optimizes the transportation, storage and natural gas supply for these operations under a three-year contract. 
We have a contract with an unaffiliated party to supply propane for customers of our Sandpiper system in Maryland who have not yet converted to natural gas. Under the contract, we are committed to purchase approximately 932,000 gallons of propane annually at either a fixed per-gallon or a local indexed-index-based price. The contract expires in May 2019, at which time, we can purchase the propane from our propane subsidiary or the external markets directly.
Our Florida natural gas distribution operation uses Peninsula Pipeline and the Peoples Gas System division of Tampa Electric Company ("Peoples Gas") to transport natural gas where there is no direct connection with FGT. 
A summary of our pipeline capacity contracts follows:

(1) In December 2018, Marlin Gas Services, LLC (“Marlin Gas Services”), our newly created subsidiary, acquired the assets of Marlin Gas Transport, Inc. ("Marlin Gas Transport"). The net loss reported is a result of the costs of consummating the acquisition exceeding the margin generated for approximately half of December 2018.
Propane Operations 
Our propane operations sell propane to residential, commercial/industrial, wholesale and AutoGas customers, in the Mid-Atlantic region, through Sharp Energy, Inc. and Sharpgas, Inc., and in Florida through FPU and Flo-gas. We deliver to and bill our propane customers based on two primary customer types: bulk delivery customers and metered customers. Bulk delivery customers receive deliveries into tanks at their location. We invoice and record revenues for these customers at the time of delivery. Metered customers are either part of an underground propane distribution system or have a meter installed on the tank at their location. We invoice and recognize revenue for these customers based on their consumption as dictated by scheduled meter reads. As a member of AutoGas Alliance, we install and support propane vehicle conversion systems for vehicle fleets and provide onsite fueling infrastructure.

Competition
Our propane operations compete with national and local independent companies primarily on the basis of price and service. Propane is generally a cheaper fuel for home heating than oil and electricity but more expensive than natural gas. Our propane operations are largely concentrated in areas that are not currently served by natural gas distribution systems.
Supplies, Transportation and Storage
We purchase propane from major oil companies and independent natural gas liquids producers. Propane is transported by truck and rail to our bulk storage facilities in Delaware, Maryland, Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia, which have a total storage capacity of 7.1 million gallons. Deliveries are made from these facilities by truck to tanks located on customers’ premises or to central storage tanks that feed our underground propane distribution systems. While propane supply has traditionally been adequate, significant fluctuations in weather, closing of refineries and disruption in supply chains, could cause temporary reductions in available supplies.
Weather
Propane revenues are affected by seasonal variations in temperature and weather conditions, which directly influence the volume of propane used by our customers. Our propane revenues are typically highest during the winter months when propane is used for heating. Sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures will tend to reduce propane use, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures will tend to increase consumption.
Unregulated Energy Transmission (Aspire Energy)
Aspire Energy owns approximately 2,700 miles of natural gas pipeline systems in 40 counties in Ohio. The majority of Aspire Energy’s revenues are derived from long-term supply agreements with Columbia Gas of Ohio and Consumers Gas Cooperative ("CGC"), which together serve more than 21,000 end-use customers. Aspire Energy purchases natural gas to serve these customers from conventional producers in the Marcellus and Utica natural gas production areas. In addition, Aspire Energy earns revenue by gathering and processing natural gas for customers. 
Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2018 Form 10-K Page  8

For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018, Aspire Energy's operating revenues and deliveries by customer type were as follows:

 | Operating revenues | | Deliveries
 | (in thousands) | | % of Total | | (in thousands Dts) | | % of Total
Supply to Columbia Gas of Ohio | $ | 13,429 | | | 38 | % | | 2,538 | | 38 | %

Total | $ | 35,407 | | | 100 | % | | 6,631 | | 100 | %

Energy Generation (Eight Flags) 
Eight Flags generates electricity and steam at its CHP plant located on Amelia Island, Florida. The plant is powered by natural gas transported by Peninsula Pipeline and our Florida natural gas distribution operation and produces approximately 21 MW of electricity and 75,000 pounds per hour of steam. Eight Flags sells the electricity generated from the plant to our Florida electric distribution operation and sells the steam to the customer who owns the site on which the plant is located both under separate 20-year contracts. 
Energy Services (PESCO)
PESCO competes with utilities and third-party marketers to sell natural gas and related services directly to commercial and industrial customers. PESCO delivers the natural gas it sells to customers through affiliated and non-affiliated natural gas distribution systems and pipelines and bills customers directly or through the billing services of the natural gas distribution utility that delivers the gas to PESCO’s customer. PESCO manages a portion of the natural gas transportation and storage capacity for our Delmarva natural gas distribution operations under three-year asset management agreements that expire on March 31, 2020. 
The following table summarizes PESCO's operating revenues by region in 2018:

In December 2018, Marlin Gas Services, our newly created subsidiary, acquired certain operating assets of Marlin Gas Transport, a supplier of mobile compressed natural gas utility and pipeline solutions. Marlin Gas Services provides a temporary solution for gas pipeline and gas distribution systems while safety and integrity work is being performed. The assets purchased have the capacity to transport more than 7 billion cubic feet of natural gas annually using one of the largest fleets of tube trailers dedicated to the transportation of compressed natural gas (“CNG”). The acquisition will allow us to offer solutions to address supply interruption scenarios and provide other unique applications where pipeline supplies are not available or cannot meet customer requirements. Operating revenues and net income generated from the date of acquisition through the year ended December 31, 2018 were immaterial.
