 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 GENERAL
 Glen Burnie Bancorp (the “Company”) is a bank holding company organized in 1990 under the laws of the State of Maryland.  The Company owns all the outstanding shares of capital stock of The Bank of Glen Burnie (the “Bank”), a commercial bank organized in 1949 under the laws of the State of Maryland, serving northern Anne Arundel County and surrounding areas from its main office and branch in Glen Burnie, Maryland and branch offices in Odenton, Riviera Beach, Crownsville, Severn (two locations), Linthicum and Severna Park, Maryland.  The Bank also maintains a remote Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”) located in Pasadena, Maryland.  The Bank maintains a website at www.thebankofglenburnie.com.  It is the oldest independent commercial bank in Anne Arundel County.  The Bank is engaged in the commercial and retail banking business as authorized by the banking statutes of the State of Maryland, including the acceptance of demand and time deposits, and the origination of loans to individuals, associations, partnerships and corporations.
 The Bank’s real estate financing consists of residential first and second mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit and commercial mortgage loans.  Commercial lending consists of both secured and unsecured loans.  The Bank also originates automobile loans through arrangements with local automobile dealers.  The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).  We attract deposit customers from the general public and use such funds, together with other borrowed funds, to make loans.  Our results of operations are primarily determined by the difference between interest incomes earned on our interest-earning assets, primarily interest and fee income on loans, and interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and borrowings.
 The Company’s principal executive office is located at 101 Crain Highway, S.E., Glen Burnie, Maryland 21061.  Its telephone number at such office is (410) 766‑3300.
 The Company also owns all of the outstanding shares of common stock of GBB Properties, Inc. (“GBB”), another Maryland corporation which was organized in 1994 and which is engaged in the business of acquiring, holding and disposing of real property, typically acquired in connection with foreclosure proceedings (or deeds in lieu of foreclosure) instituted by the Bank or acquired in connection with branch expansions by the Bank (See next paragraph.)
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law major tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform Act").  The Tax Reform Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and makes many other changes to the U.S. tax code.  We were required to revalue our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new statutory tax rate upon enactment.  As a result of this revaluation, in 2017, we recognized a one-time $0.6 million income tax expense.

On January 10, 2019, the Boards of Bancorp and the Bank approved the contribution from Bancorp to the Bank of all of the common stock of GBB.  The contribution and assignment of 3,600 shares of common stock occurred on January 22, 2019 and was treated as a capital contribution.

 MARKET AREA
 The Bank considers its principal market area for lending and deposit products to consist of Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  Anne Arundel County includes the suburbs of the City of Baltimore and is characterized by an aging population.  Management believes that the majority of the working population in its market area either commutes to Baltimore or is employed at businesses located at or around the nearby Baltimore Washington International Airport.  Lending activities are broader, including the entire State of Maryland, and, to a limited extent, the surrounding states.  All of our revenue is generated within the United States. COMPETITION
 Our principal competitors for deposits are other financial institutions, including other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, and local banks and branches or affiliates of other larger banks located in our primary market area.  Competition among these institutions is based primarily on interest rates and other terms offered, service charges imposed on deposit accounts, the quality of services rendered, and the convenience of banking facilities.  Additional competition for depositors' funds comes from mutual funds, U.S. Government securities, insurance companies and private issuers of debt obligations and suppliers of other investment alternatives for depositors such as securities firms.  Competition from credit unions has intensified in recent years as historical federal limits on membership have been relaxed.  Because federal law subsidizes credit unions by giving them a general exemption from federal income taxes, credit unions have a significant cost advantage over banks and savings associations, which are fully subject to federal income taxes.  Credit unions may use this advantage to offer rates that are highly competitive with those offered by banks and thrifts.
 The Bank’s interest rates, loan and deposit terms, and offered products and services are impacted, to a large extent, by competition.  With respect to indirect lending, the Bank faces competition from other banks and the financing arms of automobile manufacturers.  We compete in this area by offering competitive rates and responsive service to dealers.  The Bank attempts to provide superior service within its community and to know, and facilitate services, to, its customers.  It seeks commercial relationships with small to medium size businesses, which the Bank believes would welcome personal service and flexibility.  The Bank believes its greatest competition comes from larger intra- and inter-state financial institutions.
 STRATEGY
 We operate on the premise that the consolidation activities in the banking industry have created an opportunity for a well-capitalized community bank to satisfy banking needs that are no longer being adequately met in the local market.  Large national and regional banks are catering to larger customers and provide an impersonal experience, and typical community banks, because of their limited capacity, are unable to meet the needs of many small-to-medium-sized businesses.  Specifically, as a result of bank mergers, many banks in the Baltimore metropolitan area became local branches of large regional and national banks.  Although size gave the larger banks some advantages in competing for business from large corporations, including economies of scale and higher lending limits, we believe that these larger, national banks remain focused on a mass market approach which de-emphasizes personal contact and service.  We also believe that the centralization of decision-making power at these large institutions has resulted in a lack of customer service.  At many of these institutions, determinations are made at the out-of-state “home office" by individuals who lack personal contact with customers as well as an understanding of the customers' needs and scope of the relationship with the institution.  We believe that this trend is ongoing, and continues to be particularly frustrating to owners of small and medium-sized businesses, business professionals and individual consumers who traditionally have been accustomed to dealing directly with a bank executive who had an understanding of their banking needs with the ability to deliver a prompt response.

 We attempt to differentiate ourselves from the competition through personalized service, flexibility in meeting the needs of customers, prompt decision making and the availability of senior management to meet with customers and prospective customers.
 PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 General
 Our primary market focus is on making loans to and gathering deposits from small and medium-sized businesses and their owners, professionals and executives, real estate investors and individual consumers in our primary market area.  We lend to customers throughout Maryland, with our core market being Northern Anne Arundel County and surrounding areas of Central Maryland.  To a limited extent, we lend to customers in neighboring states.  The Bank offers a full range of consumer and commercial loans.  The Bank’s lending activities include residential and commercial real estate loans, construction loans, land acquisition and development loans, commercial loans and consumer installment lending including indirect automobile lending.  Substantially all of the Bank’s loan customers are residents of Anne Arundel County and surrounding areas of Central Maryland.  The Bank solicits loan applications for commercial loans from small to medium sized businesses located in its market area.  The Company believes that this is a market in which a relatively small community bank, like the Bank, has a competitive advantage in personal service and flexibility.  The Bank’s consumer lending currently consists primarily of indirect automobile loans originated through arrangements with local dealers. Lending Activities
 Credit Policies and Administration
 The Bank’s lending activities are conducted pursuant to written policies approved by the Board of Directors (“Board”) intended to ensure proper management of credit risk.  Loans are subject to a well-defined credit process that includes credit evaluation of borrowers, establishment of lending limits and application of lending procedures, including the holding of adequate collateral and the maintenance of compensating balances, as well as procedures for on-going identification and management of credit deterioration.  Regular portfolio reviews are performed by the Bank’s senior credit officer to identify potential underperforming loans and other credit facilities, estimate loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the Bank’s policies.  For significant problem loans, management review consists of evaluation of the financial strengths of the borrower and any guarantor, the related collateral, and the effects of economic conditions.
 The Bank’s loan approval policy provides for various levels of individual lending authority.  The maximum aggregate lending authority granted by the Bank to any one Lending Officer is $750,000.  A combination of approvals from certain officers may be used to lend up to an aggregate of $1,000,000.  We have adopted a comprehensive lending policy, which includes stringent underwriting standards for all types of loans.  Our lending staff follows pricing guidelines established periodically by our management team.  The Bank maintains two committees, separate from the Board of Directors, which have authorization to approve extensions of credit.  The two committees are called the Officer’s Loan Committee (“OLC”) and the Executive Committee (“EC”).  The OLC is authorized to approve extensions of credit where the total aggregate amount of credit to the borrower or guarantor is less than or equal to $1,000,000.  The OLC consists of the President/Chief Executive Officer (“President/CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), and Chief Lending Officer (“CLO”) plus two additional loan officers.  The EC approves extensions of credit where the aggregate amount of credit to an existing borrower is less than or equal to $3,000,000.  The EC is comprised of the Chairman of the Board, or the President/CEO plus two (2) outside Directors.  Extensions of credit greater than $3,000,000 must be approved by the Board of Directors.  Under the leadership of our executive management team, we believe that we employ experienced lending officers, secure appropriate collateral and carefully monitor the financial conditions of our borrowers and the concentration of loans in our portfolio.
 All loans by the Bank to our directors and executive officers and their affiliates require pre-approval by the Bank’s Board of Directors to ensure, among other things, compliance with Section 23A and Section 23B of the Federal 

 
  5

 
Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder.  It is the Bank’s policy that all approved loans must be made on substantially the same terms as loans made to persons who are unrelated to the Bank.
 In addition to the normal repayment risks, all loans in the portfolio are subject to the state of the economy and the related effects on the borrower and/or the real estate market.  Generally, longer-term loans have periodic interest rate adjustments and/or call provisions.  Senior management monitors the loan portfolio closely to ensure that we minimize past due loans and that we swiftly deal with potential problem loans.
 The Bank also retains an outside, independent firm to review the loan portfolio.  This firm performs a detailed annual review.  We use the results of the firm’s report primarily to validate the risk ratings applied to loans in the portfolio and identify any systemic weaknesses in underwriting, documentation or management of the portfolio.  Results of the annual review are presented to executive management, the audit committee of the board and the full board of directors and are available to and used by regulatory examiners when they review the Bank’s asset quality.
 The Bank maintains the normal checks and balances on the loan portfolio not only through the underwriting process but through the utilization of an internal credit administration group that both assists in the underwriting and serves as an additional reviewer of underwriting.  The separately managed loan administration group also has oversight for documentation, compliance and timeliness of collection activities.  Our internal audit department also reviews documentation, compliance and file management.
 Real Estate Lending
 The Bank offers long-term mortgage financing for residential and commercial real estate as well as shorter term construction and land development loans.  Residential mortgage and residential construction loans are originated with fixed rates, while commercial mortgages may be originated on either a fixed or variable rate basis.  Commercial construction loans may be originated on either a fixed or a variable rate basis.  Substantially all of the Bank’s real estate loans are secured by properties in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  Under the Bank’s loan policies, the maximum permissible loan-to-value ratio for owner-occupied residential mortgages is 80% of the lesser of the purchase price or appraised value.  For residential investment properties, the maximum loan-to-value ratio is 80%.  The maximum permissible loan-to-value ratio for residential and residential construction loans is 80%.  The maximum loan-to-value ratio for permanent commercial mortgages is 75%.  The maximum loan-to-value ratio for land development loans is 70% and for unimproved land is 65%.  The Bank also offers home equity loans secured by the borrower’s primary residence, provided that the aggregate indebtedness on the property does not exceed 80% of its value for loan commitments greater than $100,000.  Because mortgage lending decisions are based on conservative lending policies, the Company has no exposure to the credit issues affecting the sub-prime residential mortgage market.
 Primary risks associated with residential real estate loans include fluctuating land and property values and rising interest rates with respect to fixed-rate, long-term loans.  Residential construction lending exposes the Company to risks related to builder performance.
 Commercial Lending
 The Bank’s commercial loan portfolio consists of demand, installment and time loans for commercial purposes.  The Bank’s business demand, installment and time lending includes various working capital loans, equipment, vehicles, lines of credit and letters of credit for commercial customers.  Demand loans require the payment of interest until called, while installment loans require a monthly payment of principal and interest, and time loans require at maturity a single payment of principal and interest due monthly.  Such loans may be made on a secured or an unsecured basis.  All such loans are underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s creditworthiness rather than the value of the collateral.
 The primary risks associated with commercial loans, including commercial real estate loans, are the quality of the borrower’s management and a number of economic and other factors which induce business failures and depreciate the value of business assets pledged to secure the loan, including competition, insufficient capital, product obsolescence, changes in the borrowers’ cost, environmental hazards, weather, changes in laws and regulations and general changes in the marketplace.

 Installment Lending
 The Bank makes consumer and commercial installment loans for the purchase of automobiles, boats, other consumer durable goods, capital goods and equipment.  Such loans provide for repayment in regular installments and are secured by the goods financed.  Also included in installment loans are other types of credit repayable in installments.   Indirect Automobile Lending
 The Bank commenced its indirect lending program in January 1998.  The Bank finances new and used automobiles for terms of no more 75 months.  The Bank will lend a maximum of 110% of invoice on new vehicles.  On used vehicles, the Bank will lend no more than 120% of the clean trade value as defined by a major national publication approved by the Bank.  The Bank requires all borrowers to obtain vendors single interest coverage protecting the Bank against loss in the case a borrower’s automobile insurance lapses.  The Bank originates indirect loans through a network of approximately 65 dealers which are primarily new car dealers located in Anne Arundel County and the surrounding counties.  Participating dealers take loan applications from their customers and transmit them to the Bank for approval.
 Indirect automobile loans, are affected primarily by domestic economic instability and a variety of factors that may lead to the borrower’s unemployment, including deteriorating economic conditions in one or more segments of a local or broader economy.  Because the Bank deals with borrowers through an intermediary on indirect automobile loans, this form of lending potentially carries greater risks of defects in the application process for which claims may be made against the Bank.  Indirect automobile lending may also involve the Bank in consumer disputes under state “lemon” or other laws.  The Bank seeks to control these risks by following strict underwriting and documentation guidelines.  In addition, dealerships are contractually obligated to indemnify the Bank for such losses for a limited period of time.
 Consumer Lending
 We offer various types of secured and unsecured consumer loans.  Generally, our consumer loans are made for personal, family or household purposes as a convenience to our customer base.  As a general guideline, a consumer’s total debt service should not exceed 40% of their gross income.  The underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and an assessment of his or her ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan.
 Consumer loans may present greater credit risk than residential real estate loans because many consumer loans are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciating assets.  Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation.  Consumer loan collections also depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability.  If a borrower suffers personal financial difficulties, the loan may not be repaid.  Also, various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount we can recover on such loans.
 Personal Unsecured Lines
 The Bank offers overdraft protection lines of credit, tied to checking accounts, as a convenience to qualified customers.
 Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Participations and Servicing
 All loans that we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures, which incorporate standard underwriting guidelines.  We originate both fixed and variable rate loans.  Our loan origination activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment that typically results in decreased loan demand.  We occasionally sell participations in commercial loans to correspondent banks if the amount of the loan exceeds our internal limits.  More rarely, we purchase loan participations from correspondent banks in the local market as well.  Those loans are underwritten in-house with the same standards as loans directly originated.

 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority
 Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors.  The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the adequacy of the value of the collateral that will secure the loan, if applicable.  To assess a business borrower’s ability to repay, we review and analyze, among other factors:  current income, credit history including the Bank’s prior experience with the borrower, cash flow, any secondary sources of repayment, other debt obligations in regards to the equity/net worth of the borrower and collateral available to the Bank to secure the loan. 
 We require appraisals or valuations of all real property securing one-to-four family residential and commercial real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit.  All appraisers are state licensed or state certified appraisers, and a list of approved appraisers is maintained and updated on an annual basis.
 Deposit Activities
 Deposits are the major source of our funding.  We offer a broad array of consumer and business deposit products that include demand, money market, and savings accounts, as well as time deposits.  We offer a competitive array of commercial cash management products, which allow us to attract demand deposits.  We believe that we pay competitive rates on our interest-bearing deposits.  As a relationship-oriented organization, we generally seek to obtain deposit relationships with our loan clients.  Other Banking Products
 We offer our customers treasury services products that include wire transfer and ACH services, debit card and automated teller machines and safe deposit boxes at all branches.  In addition to traditional deposit services, we offer telephone banking services, mobile banking, internet banking services and internet bill paying services to our customers.   Other Activities
 The Company also owns all outstanding shares of capital stock of GBB Properties, Inc. (“GBB”), another Maryland corporation which was organized in 1994 and which is engaged in the business of acquiring, holding and disposing of real property, typically acquired in connection with foreclosure proceedings (or deeds in lieu of foreclosure) instituted by the Bank or acquired in connection with branch expansions by the Bank. EMPLOYEES
 At December 31, 2018, the Bank had 98 full-time equivalent employees.  Neither the Company nor GBB currently has any employees.  None of our employees are represented by a union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement.  Management considers its employee relations to be excellent. SUPERVISON AND REGULATION
 General
 The Company and the Bank are extensively regulated under federal and state law.  To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions.  Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and our prospective business.  Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and by the policies of various regulatory authorities.  We are unable to predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, economic controls, or new federal or state legislation may have in the future.
 The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHCA”).  As such, the Company is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 

 
  8

 
“Federal Reserve Board”) and subject to Federal Reserve Board regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements.  As a bank holding company, the Company is required to furnish to the Federal Reserve Board annual and quarterly reports of its operations at the end of each period and to furnish such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the BHCA.  The Company is also subject to regular inspection by Federal Reserve Board examiners.  As a publicly traded company whose common stock is registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, we are under the jurisdiction of the SEC and subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC.  We are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and we are subject to the rules of NASDAQ for listed companies.
 As a state-chartered bank with deposits insured by the FDIC but which is not a member of the Federal Reserve System (a “state non-member bank”), the Bank is subject to the supervision of the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation (“Commissioner”) and the FDIC.  This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance funds and depositors, and not for the protection of stockholders.  The Commissioner and FDIC regularly examine the operations of the Bank, including but not limited to capital adequacy, assets, earnings, liquidity, sensitivity to market interest rates, reserves, loans, investments and management practices.  In addition, the Bank is required to furnish quarterly and annual Call Reports to the Commissioner and FDIC.  The FDIC’s enforcement authority includes the power to remove officers and directors and the authority to issue cease-and-desist orders to prevent a bank from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or violating laws or regulations governing its business.
 Some of the aspects of the lending and deposit business of the Bank that are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC include reserve requirements and disclosure requirements in connection with personal and mortgage loans and savings deposit accounts.  In addition, the Bank is subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations which set forth specific restrictions and procedural requirements with respect to the establishment of branches, investments, interest rates on loans, credit practices, the disclosure of customer information, the disclosure of credit terms and discrimination in credit transactions.
 Federal Home Loan Bank System
 The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”), which is one of 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.  The FHLB System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending.  The Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock of the FHLB as a condition of membership.  As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement.   Consumer Financial Protection Laws
 The Bank is subject to a number of federal and state consumer financial protection laws and regulations that extensively govern its transactions with consumers.  These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Service Members Civil Relief Act.  The Bank must also comply with applicable state usury laws and other laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts and practices.  These laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and the terms of deposit accounts, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, restrict the Bank’s ability to raise interest rates and subject the Bank to substantial regulatory oversight.  Violations of these laws may expose us to liability from potential lawsuits brought by affected customers.  Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce these consumer financial protection laws, in which case we may be subject to regulatory sanctions, civil money penalties, and customer rescission rights.

 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in 2010, significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry.  The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that profoundly affected the regulation of community banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies.  Among other things, these provisions relaxed rules on interstate branching, allow financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, and impose heightened capital requirements on bank and thrift holding companies.  The Dodd-Frank Act also includes several corporate governance provisions that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions.  These include provisions mandating certain disclosures regarding executive compensation and provisions addressing proxy access by shareholders.
 The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve and transferred to the CFPB primary responsibility for administering substantially all of the consumer compliance protection laws formerly administered by other federal agencies.  The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the CFPB to promulgate consumer protection regulations that will apply to all entities, including banks that offer consumer financial services or products.  It also includes a series of provisions covering mortgage loan origination standards affecting, among other things, originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, and pre-payment penalties.
 The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types, including some that may affect our business in substantial and unpredictable ways.  We have incurred higher operating costs in complying with the Dodd-Frank Act, and we expect that these higher costs will continue for the foreseeable future.  Our management continues to monitor the ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and as new regulations are issued, will assess their effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 The Volcker Rule
 The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds.  The provision of the statute imposing these restrictions is commonly called the “Volcker Rule.”  The regulations implementing the Volcker Rule require institutions to conform their activities to the requirements of the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015, and to conform their investments in certain “legacy covered funds” by July 21, 2017.  These regulations exempt the Bank, as a bank with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets that does not engage in any covered activities. Liquidity Requirements
 Historically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures.  The Basel III final framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation.  One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario.  The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio, or NSFR, is designed to promote more medium and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon.  These requirements are expected to incentivize banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source.
 In September 2015, the federal bank regulators approved final rules implementing the LCR for advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure) and a modified version of the LCR for bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approach banking organizations, neither of which would apply to the Company or the Bank.  The federal bank regulators have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR, but the Federal Reserve has stated its intent to adopt a version of this measure as well.

 Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA)
 Under the BHCA our activities are limited to business closely related to banking, managing, or controlling banks.  We are also subject to capital requirements applied on a consolidated basis in a form substantially similar to those required of the Bank.  The BHCA also requires a bank holding company to obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before (i)  acquiring, or holding more than 5% voting interest in any bank or bank holding company, (ii)  acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or (iii)  merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.  The BHCA also restricts non-bank activities to those which, by statute or by Federal Reserve regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks.
 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA)
 The GLBA removed barriers to affiliations among banks, insurance companies, the securities industry, and other financial service providers, and provides greater flexibility to these organizations in structuring such affiliations.  The GLBA also expanded the types of financial activities a bank may conduct through a financial subsidiary and established a distinct type of bank holding company, known as a financial holding company, which may engage in an expanded list of activities that are “financial in nature.”  These activities include securities and insurance brokerage, securities underwriting, insurance underwriting, and merchant banking.  A bank holding company may become a financial holding company only if all of its subsidiary financial institutions are well-capitalized and well-managed and have at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating. While we meet these standards, we do not currently intend to file notice with the Federal Reserve to become a financial holding company or to engage in expanded financial activities through a financial subsidiary of the Bank.  The GLBA also includes privacy protections for nonpublic personal information held by financial institutions regarding their customers, and establishes a system of functional regulation that makes the Federal Reserve the “umbrella supervisor” for holding companies, and other federal and state agencies the supervisor of the holding company’s subsidiaries.
 Financial Privacy
 In accordance with the GLBA, federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about customers to nonaffiliated third parties.  These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party.  The privacy provisions of the GLBA affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors.  We are also subject to various state laws that generally require us to notify any customer whose personal financial information may have been released to an unauthorized person as the result of a breach of our data security policies and procedures.
 Under Maryland law, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring control of any bank if the bank holding company would control more than 30% of the total deposits of all depository institutions in the State of Maryland unless waived by the Commissioner.  The Maryland Financial Institutions Code prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring more than 5% of any class of voting stock of a bank or bank holding company without the approval of the Commissioner except as otherwise expressly permitted by federal law or in certain other limited situations.  The Maryland Financial Institutions Code additionally prohibits any person from acquiring voting stock in a bank or bank holding company without 60 days’ prior notice to the Commissioner if such acquisition will give the person control of 25% or more of the voting stock of the bank or bank holding company or will affect the power to direct or to cause the direction of the policy or management of the bank or bank holding company.  Any doubt whether the stock acquisition will affect the power to direct or cause the direction of policy or management shall be resolved in favor of reporting to the Commissioner.  The Commissioner may deny approval of the acquisition if the Commissioner determines it to be anti-competitive or to threaten the safety or soundness of a banking institution.  Voting stock acquired in violation of this statute may not be voted for five years.

 Capital Standards
 In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies approved final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for all U.S. banks and for bank holding companies with greater than $500 million in assets.  The Federal bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in their examination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks.  If capital falls below the minimum levels established by these guidelines, a bank holding company or bank must submit an acceptable plan for achieving compliance with the capital guidelines and, until its capital sufficiently improves, will be subject to denial of applications and appropriate supervisory enforcement actions.  Under these final rules, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank.  Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards:  a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.  The final rules also require a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule.  Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management.  A three-year phase in period for the capital buffer requirement began in 2016.  The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5%, and the total capital ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis.  These capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015.
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset.  Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk.  Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings.  Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital.  Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.  Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital.  Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.  Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values.  Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.  In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.
 The final rules also increase the required capital for certain categories of assets, including higher-risk construction real estate loans and certain exposures related to securitizations.  The final rules adopt the risk weights for residential mortgages under the existing general risk-based capital rules, which assign a risk weight of either 50% (for most first-lien exposures) or 100% for other residential mortgage exposures.  
 As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements.  Management also believes that, as of that date, we would have met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis had those requirements been currently in effect.

 Loans-to-One Borrower
 Under Maryland law, the maximum amount which the Bank is permitted to lend to any one borrower and their related interests may generally not exceed 10% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus, which is defined to include the Bank’s capital, surplus, retained earnings and 50% of its allowance for possible loan losses.  By interpretive ruling of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation, Maryland banks have the option of lending up to the amount that would be permissible for a national bank which is generally 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus (defined to include a bank’s total capital for regulatory capital purposes plus any loan loss allowances not included in regulatory capital).  As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
 Prompt Corrective Action Regulations
 The FDIC’s prompt corrective action regulations establish five capital levels for financial institutions (“well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized”), and impose mandatory regulatory scrutiny and limitations on institutions that are less than adequately capitalized.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank was categorized as “well capitalized,” meaning that our total risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10.00%, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio exceeded 8.00%, our common equity Tier-1 risk-based capital ratio exceeded 6.50%, our leverage ratio exceeded 5.00%, and we are not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Dividends and Distributions
 The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices.  The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earning retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition.
 Bank holding companies are required to give the Federal Reserve Board notice of any purchase or redemption of their outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the bank holding company’s consolidated net worth.  The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order, directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board.  Bank holding companies whose capital ratios exceed the thresholds for “well capitalized” banks on a consolidated basis are exempt from the foregoing requirement if they were rated composite 1 or 2 in their most recent inspection and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
 USA Patriot Act of 2001
 The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) substantially broadened the scope of anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations on financial institutions.  The regulations adopted by the Treasury under the Patriot Act require financial institutions to maintain appropriate controls to combat money laundering activities, perform due diligence of private banking and correspondent accounts, establish standards for verifying customer identity, and provide records related to suspected anti-money laundering activities upon request from federal authorities.  A financial institution’s failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches, and could also have other serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.  We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations.  However, it is reasonable to anticipate that the United States Congress may enact additional legislation in the future to combat terrorism including modifications to existing laws such as the Patriot Act to expand powers as deemed necessary.  The enactment of the Patriot Act has increased the Bank’s compliance costs, and the impact of any additional legislation enacted by Congress may have upon financial institutions

is uncertain.  However, such legislation would likely increase compliance costs and thereby potentially have an adverse effect upon the Company’s results of operations.
 Community Reinvestment Act
 The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions, federal banking regulators must evaluate the record of the financial institution in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank.  Federal banking regulators are required to consider a financial institution’s performance in these areas as they review applications filed by the institution to engage in mergers or acquisitions or to open a branch or facility.  In addition, any bank rated in “substantial noncompliance” with the CRA regulations may be subject to enforcement proceedings.  The Bank has a current rating of “satisfactory” for CRA compliance. Interstate Branching
 The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the authority of a state or national bank to open offices in other states.  A state or national bank may now open a de novo branch in a state where the bank does not already operate a branch if the law of the state where the branch is to be located would permit a state bank chartered by that state to open the branch.  This provision removed restrictions under prior law that restricted a state or national bank from expanding into another state unless the laws of the bank’s home state and the laws of the other state both permitted out-of-state banks to open de novo branches. Dividend Limitations
 The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is limited by state and federal laws and regulations that require the Bank to obtain the prior approval before paying a dividend that, together with other dividends it has paid during a calendar year, would exceed the sum of its net income for the year to date combined with its retained net income for the previous two years.  Pursuant to the Maryland Financial Institutions Code, Maryland banks may only pay dividends from undivided profits or, with the prior approval of the Commissioner, their surplus in excess of 100% of required capital stock.  The Maryland Financial Institutions Code further restricts the payment of dividends by prohibiting a Maryland bank from declaring a dividend on its shares of common stock until its surplus fund equals the amount of required capital stock or, if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, in an amount in excess of 90% of net earnings.  In addition, the Bank is prohibited by federal statute from paying dividends or making any other capital distribution that would cause the Bank to fail to meet its regulatory capital requirements.  Further, the FDIC also has authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a state non-member bank when it determines such payment to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) includes provisions intended to enhance corporate responsibility and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws, and which increase penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at public traded companies.  The SOX generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act.
 Among other things, the SOX creates the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) as an independent body subject to SEC supervision with responsibility for setting auditing, quality control, and ethical standards for auditors of public companies.  The SOX also requires public companies to make faster and more-extensive financial disclosures, requires the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of public companies to provide signed certifications as to the accuracy and completeness of financial information filed with the SEC, and provides enhanced criminal and civil penalties for violations of the federal securities laws.
 The SOX also addresses functions and responsibilities of audit committees of public companies.  The statute, by mandating certain stock exchange listing rules, makes the audit committee directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of the company’s outside auditor, and requires the auditor to report directly to the audit committee.  The SOX authorizes each audit committee to engage independent counsel and other advisors, and 

 
  14

 
requires a public company to provide the appropriate funding, as determined by its audit committee, to pay the company’s auditors and any advisors that its audit committee retains.  The SOX also requires public companies to prepare an internal control report and assessment by management, along with an attestation to this report prepared by the company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in their annual reports to stockholders.
 FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessment
 The Dodd-Frank Act which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, changed how the FDIC calculates deposit insurance premiums payable by insured depository institutions.  The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FDIC to calculate the deposit insurance assessments payable by each insured depository institution based generally upon the institution’s average total consolidated assets minus its average tangible equity during the assessment period.  Previously, an institution’s assessments were based on the amount of its insured deposits.  The minimum deposit insurance fund rate will increase from 1.15% to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and the cost of the increase will be borne by depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more.  The Dodd-Frank Act also provides the FDIC with discretion to determine whether to pay rebates to insured depository institutions when its deposit insurance reserves exceed certain thresholds. Transactions with Affiliates
 A state non-member bank or its subsidiaries may not engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate in an amount greater than 10% of such bank’s capital stock and surplus, and for all such transactions with all affiliates a state non-member bank is limited to an amount equal to 20% of capital stock and surplus.  All such transactions must also be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate.  The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar other types of transactions. An affiliate of a state non-member bank is any company or entity which controls or is under common control with the state non-member bank and, for purposes of the aggregate limit on transactions with affiliates, any subsidiary that would be deemed a financial subsidiary of a national bank.  In a holding company context, the parent holding company of a state non-member bank (such as the Company) and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the state non-member bank.  The BHCA further prohibits a depository institution from extending credit to or offering any other services, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or certain of its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution, subject to certain limited exceptions. Loans to Directors, Executive Officers and Principal Stockholders
 Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders of a state non-member bank must be made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing for comparable transactions with persons who are not executive officers, directors, principal stockholders or employees of the Bank unless the loan is made pursuant to a compensation or benefit plan that is widely available to employees and does not favor insiders.  Loans to any executive officer, director and principal stockholder together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests generally may not exceed 15% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus and all loans to such persons may not exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.  Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, in excess of the greater of $100,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (up to $500,000) must be approved in advance by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Bank with any “interested” director not participating in the voting.  State non-member banks are prohibited from paying the overdrafts of any of their executive officers or directors.  In addition, loans to executive officers may not be made on terms more favorable than those afforded other borrowers and are restricted as to type, amount and terms of credit.
