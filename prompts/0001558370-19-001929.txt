 Products and Services
     In our core business, we provide and continue to develop commercially-viable hydrogen and fuel cell product solutions to replace lead‑acid batteries in electric material handling vehicles and industrial trucks for some of the world’s largest distribution and manufacturing businesses. We are focusing our efforts on industrial mobility applications (electric forklifts and electric industrial vehicles) at multi‑shift high volume manufacturing and high throughput distribution sites where our products and services provide a unique combination of productivity, flexibility and environmental benefits. Additionally, we manufacture and sell fuel cell products to replace batteries and diesel generators in stationary backup power applications. These products prove valuable with telecommunications, transportation and utility customers as robust, reliable and sustainable power solutions. 
     Our current products and services include:
     GenDrive: GenDrive is our hydrogen fueled PEM fuel cell system providing power to material handling electric vehicles, including class 1, 2, 3 and 6 electric forklifts and ground support equipment;

 We provide our products worldwide through our direct product sales force, and by leveraging relationships with original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and their dealer networks. 
     To promote fuel cell adoption and maintain post‑sale customer satisfaction, we offer a range of service and support options through extended maintenance contracts. Additionally, customers may waive our service option, and choose to service their systems independently. A high percentage of fuel cells sold in recent years were bundled with maintenance contracts. As a result, only approximately 1.0% of fuel cells deployed are still under standard warranty that is not a part of an extended maintenance contract.
     Markets/Geography & Order Status
     The Company’s products and services predominantly serve the North American and European material handling markets, and primarily support large to mid-sized fleet, multi‑shift operations in high‑volume manufacturing and high‑throughput distribution centers. Based on recent market experience, it appears there may be some seasonality to sales stemming from varied customer appropriation cycles; however, these market factors will continue to evolve and the Company’s insight to these trends will improve with continued commercial success and time.
    
Orders for the Company’s products and services approximated $225.0 million and $285.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company’s backlog for products and services approximated $540.0 million and $500.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company’s backlog at any given time is comprised of fuel cells, hydrogen installations, maintenance services, and hydrogen fuel deliveries. The specific elements of the backlog will vary in terms of timing of delivery and can vary between 90 days to 10 years, with fuel cells and hydrogen installations being delivered near term and maintenance services and hydrogen fuel deliveries being delivered

over a longer period of time. Historically, shipments made against product orders generally occur between ninety days and twenty‑four months from the date of acceptance of the order.
     For the year ended December 31, 2018, 66.7% of total consolidated revenues were associated primarily with Amazon.com, Inc (Amazon) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc (Walmart), representing 22.1% and 44.6%, respectively. A loss or decline in business with any of the aforementioned parties, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
     We assemble our products at our manufacturing facilities in Latham, New York, Clifton Park, New York and Spokane, Washington, and provide our services and installations at customer locations and service centers in Illinois and Ohio. Currently, the supply and manufacture of varied critical components used in our products and services are performed by sole‑sourced third‑party vendors in the U.S., Canada and China.
     Distribution, Marketing and Strategic Relationships
     We have developed strategic relationships with well‑established companies in key areas including distribution, service, marketing, supply, technology development and product development. We sell our products worldwide, with a primary focus on North America, through our direct product sales force, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and their dealer networks. Additionally, we operate in Europe under the name HyPulsion, to develop and sell hydrogen fuel cell systems for the European material handling market.     Competition
     We are confronted by competition in all areas of our business. The markets we address for motive power are characterized by the presence of well‑established battery and combustion generator products. The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include product features, including size and weight, relative price and performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.
     In the material handling market, we believe our GenDrive products have an advantage over lead‑acid batteries for customers who run high‑throughput distribution centers and manufacturing locations with multi‑shift operations by offering increased productivity with lower operational costs. However, we expect competition in this space to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate our approach with their own offerings. 
     Intellectual Property
     We believe that neither we nor our competitors can achieve a significant proprietary position on the basic technologies currently used in PEM fuel cell systems. However, we believe the design and integration of our system and system components, as well as some of the low‑cost manufacturing processes that we have developed, are intellectual property that can be protected. Our intellectual property portfolio covers among other things: fuel cell components that reduce manufacturing part count; fuel cell system designs that lend themselves to mass manufacturing; improvements to fuel cell system efficiency, reliability and system life; and control strategies, such as added safety protections and operation under extreme conditions. In general, our employees are party to agreements providing that all inventions, whether patented or not, made or conceived while being our employee, which are related to or result from work or research that we perform, will remain our sole and exclusive property.
     We have a total of 125 issued patents currently active with the USPTO. At the close of 2018, we had four U.S. patent applications pending. Additionally, we have 19 trademarks registered with the USPTO and three trademark applications pending.
     Government Regulation
     Our products and their installations are subject to oversight and regulation at the state and local level in accordance with state and local statutes and ordinances relating to, among others, building codes, fire codes, public safety, electrical and gas pipeline connections and hydrogen siting. The level of regulation may depend, in part, upon where a system is located.

 In addition, product safety standards have been established by the American National Standards Institute, or ANSI, covering the overall fuel cell system. The class 1, 2 and 3 GenDrive products are designed with the intent of meeting the requirements of UL 2267 “Fuel Cell Power Systems for Installation in Industrial Electric Trucks” and NFPA 505 “Fire Safety Standard for Powered Industrial Trucks”. The hydrogen tanks used in these systems have been either certified to ANSI/CSA NGV2‑2007 “Compressed Natural Gas Vehicle Fuel Containers” or ISO/TS 15869 “Gaseous hydrogen and hydrogen blends—Land vehicle fuel tanks”. We will continue to design our GenDrive products to meet ANSI and/or other standards in 2018. We certified several models of Class 1, 2 and 3 GenDrive products to the requirements of the CE mark with guidance from a European certified body. The hydrogen tanks used in these systems are certified to the Pressure Equipment Directive by a European certified body.
     The GenFuel hydrogen storage and dispensing products are designed with the intent of meeting the requirements of NFPA 2 “Hydrogen Technologies Code”.
     Other than these requirements, at this time we do not know what additional requirements, if any, each jurisdiction will impose on our products or their installation. We also do not know the extent to which any new regulations may impact our ability to distribute, install and service our products. As we continue distributing our systems to our target markets, the federal, state, local or foreign government entities may seek to impose regulations or competitors may seek to influence regulations through lobbying efforts.
     Raw Materials and Suppliers
     Most components essential to our business are generally available from multiple sources.  We believe there are component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to us could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition. We are mitigating these potential risks by introducing alternate system architectures which we expect will allow us to diversify our supply chain with multiple fuel cell stack and air supply component vendors. We are also working closely with these vendors and other key suppliers on coordinated product introduction plans, strategic inventories, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels.     Research and Development
     Because the fuel cell industry is characterized by its early state of adoption, our ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. We continue to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of cost, size, weight, and in supporting service solutions in order to drive further commercialization.
     We may expand the range of our product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third‑party business and technology. Our research and development expense totaled $33.9 million, $28.7 million, and $21.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We also had cost of research and development contract revenue of zero, $0.3 million, $0.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These expenses represent the cost of research and development programs that are partially funded under cost reimbursement research and development arrangements with third parties and are reported within other cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we had 685 employees, including 110 temporary employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be positive.
