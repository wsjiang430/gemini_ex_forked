Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 TechTarget, Inc. (“we” or “the Company”) is a Delaware corporation incorporated on September 14, 1999. Through continued innovation around our specialized online content for buyers of enterprise information technology (“IT”), we have become a global leader in purchase intent-driven marketing and sales services that deliver business impact for enterprise technology vendors. Our offerings enable technology vendors to better identify, reach and influence corporate IT decision makers actively researching specific IT purchases. We improve vendors’ ability to impact these audiences for business growth using advanced targeting, analytics and data services complemented with customized marketing programs that integrate demand generation and brand marketing and advertising techniques.
 IT and business professionals have become increasingly specialized, and because each of the websites within our network of over 140 websites focuses on a specific IT sector such as storage, security, networking, or business applications. IT and business professionals rely on us for key decision support information tailored to their specific areas of responsibility.
 We enable IT and business professionals to navigate the complex and rapidly-changing IT landscape where purchasing decisions can have significant financial and operational consequences. Our content strategy includes three primary sources which IT and business professionals use to assist them in their pre-purchase research: independent content provided by our professionals, vendor-generated content provided by our customers and member-generated, or peer-to-peer, content. In addition to utilizing our independent editorial content, registered members appreciate the ability to deepen their pre-purchase research by accessing the extensive vendor supplied content available across our website network. Likewise, these members derive significant additional value from the ability our network provides to seamlessly interact with and contribute to information exchanges in a given field.
 We had approximately 20.0 million and 19.1 million registered members – our “audiences” – as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. While the size of our registered member base does not provide direct insight into our customer numbers or our revenues, the value of our services sold to our customers is a direct result of the breadth and reach of this content footprint. This footprint creates the opportunity for our clients to gain business leverage by targeting our audiences through customized marketing programs. Likewise, the behavior exhibited by these audiences enables us to provide our customers with data products to improve their marketing and sales efforts. The targeted nature of our member base enables IT vendors to reach a specialized audience efficiently because our content is highly segmented and aligned with the IT vendors’ specific products. With it, we have developed a broad customer base and, in 2018, delivered marketing and sales services programs to approximately 1,300 customers.
 Please refer to the section below titled “Our Strategy” regarding our longer-term expansion plans and to Item 6, Selected Financial Data, for detailed information about our revenues, net income, total assets and other financial results.
 Business Trends
 Our business is impacted by macro-economic conditions, including IT industry trends and foreign currency markets. Because most of our customers are IT vendors, the success of our business is intrinsically linked to the health, and subject to the market conditions, of the IT industry. The performance of the United States (“U.S.”) dollar against foreign currencies impacts our results because our largest customers derive a significant amount of revenue from outside the U.S. In years when the U.S. dollar is strong and foreign currencies are relatively weak, our ten major global customers’ revenues and marketing budgets are adversely impacted, which impacts our revenues. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar is weak against foreign currencies, revenues attributable to our largest customers can be positively impacted. Our mid-sized customers (our largest 100 customers, excluding those companies we consider our ten major global customers) and smaller customers (typically venture-backed start-ups) generally have less exposure to non-U.S. business. Thus, these customers, while still impacted by general IT industry trends, tend to be less impacted by foreign currency market trends, which generally results in less of an impact on their marketing budgets and, in turn, our revenues.

Industry Background
 IT and business professionals’ reliance on online content to research major purchase decisions, and the transition by IT vendors of marketing expenditures from offline to online channels, have been consistent trends that have benefitted us. Going forward, there are some important related trends that we believe our business strategy is well positioned to benefit from:

• | Technology Marketers and Sales Organizations are Increasingly Using Audience Data to Drive Decisions. In the business technology market in particular, companies are increasingly using data to help them determine which prospective accounts should be prioritized for marketing or sales follow-up. We believe we are uniquely positioned to provide data around the purchase intent of specific prospective accounts and potential buyers because of the nature of the content we create and our product focus in these data-driven areas.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There is an Increasing Focus on the Ability to Measure and Improve Return on Investment. Our customers are increasingly focused on measuring and improving their return on investment (“ROI”) in marketing and sales. Before the advent of internet-based marketing, there were limited tools for accurately measuring the results of such activities in a timely fashion. The internet has enabled IT vendors to track individual members and their responses to marketing. With the appropriate technology, vendors now have the ability to assess and benchmark the efficacy of their online programs cost-effectively and in real-time. We believe our offerings benefit as our customers continue to leverage the insights gained from this measurement, and that the data and related services we are providing will assist them as they look to optimize their marketing programs going forward.

Corporate IT Purchasing
 Over the past two decades, corporate IT purchases have grown in size and complexity. The corporate IT market comprises multiple large sectors such as storage, security and networking. Each of these sectors can be further divided into sub-sectors addressing more granular areas of specialization within an enterprise’s IT environment. For example, within the multi-billion dollar storage sector, there are numerous sub-sectors such as storage area networks, storage management software and backup software. Furthermore, the products – and therefore the vendors – in each sub-sector may represent entirely independent markets. For example, the market around backup software for use in Windows® environments can be completely distinct from that addressing Linux® environments.
 In view of the complexities, high cost and importance of IT decision-making, corporate IT purchasing decisions are increasingly being researched by teams of functional experts with specialized knowledge in their particular areas, rather than by one central IT professional, such as a Chief Information Officer (“CIO”). For these reasons and more, the corporate IT purchasing process typically requires a lengthy sales cycle. The “sales cycle” is the sequence of stages that a typical customer goes through when deciding to purchase a product or service from a particular vendor. Key stages of a sales cycle typically consist of a customer recognizing or identifying a need; identifying possible solutions and vendors through research and evaluation; and finally, making a decision to purchase the product or service. Through various stages of this sales cycle, IT and business professionals rely upon multiple inputs from independent experts, peers and IT vendors. Although there is a vast amount of information available, the aggregation and validation of these inputs from various sources can be difficult and time-consuming.
 The long sales cycle for corporate IT purchases, as well as customers’ needs for significant information support, requires substantial investment on the part of IT vendors. These realities drive the significant marketing expenditures observable in the corporate IT market. In addition, given the continued acceleration of technological change, at any given time, there are often multiple solution possibilities to any particular IT need. With each new product or product enhancement, IT vendors implement new marketing outreach, and as a result IT and business professionals are required to continuously engage in research to stay abreast of the latest developments that could benefit their companies.

The Opportunity
 Prior to widespread internet adoption, corporate IT buyers researching purchases relied largely on traditional IT media, consisting of broad print publications and large industry trade shows. Today, corporate IT and business professionals are demanding specialized online content tailored to the specialized sub-sectors of IT solutions that they must understand. As technology, vendors and IT and business professionals have all become much more specialized, the internet has become a preferred purchase research medium, which has dramatically increased research activity, accelerated information consumption and improved professional decision-making.
 IT vendors seek high-ROI marketing opportunities that can provide them access to the specific sectors of IT buyers aligned with the solutions they sell. To be more efficient and effective, they need to distinguish these prospective buyers from accounts or individuals who are not yet ready to engage in the buying process. Thus, they look for assistance in identifying the specific accounts and individuals who are actively researching upcoming purchases. To more quickly and successfully position their respective solutions against alternatives being considered, they also seek assistance from marketing service providers to help influence these audiences by utilizing data driven insights to enable advanced demand-generating content marketing and targeted branding.

• | Increase Efficiency of Purchasing Decisions. By accessing targeted and specialized information, IT and business professionals are able to research important purchasing decisions more effectively. Our integrated content offering minimizes the time spent searching for and evaluating content and maximizes the time available for assimilating quality information. To support IT and business professionals’ information consumption preferences, we provide this specialized, targeted content through a variety of media types matching the critical stages within the purchase decision process.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Benefits to IT Vendors
  
• | Provide Unique Data about In-Market Prospects. Our Activity Intelligence analytical product platform captures and interprets the content consumption behaviors of our large base of targeted IT and business professional members as they research technology needs. This allows us to provide IT vendors with powerful behavioral insight to help them more effectively identify and pursue prospective buyers. Vendors who are increasingly making use of data to drive their marketing and sales strategies make use of our offerings as a key input to driving their progress against this objective.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Target Active Buyers Efficiently. Our highly targeted content attracts specific, targeted audiences who are actively researching purchasing decisions. Using our database of registered members and information we collect about their product interests, we are able to accurately target those registered members most likely to be of value to IT vendors, and support vendor-customer’s execution with scalable marketing services programs that help influence these prospective buyers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Generate Measurable Results. Our targeted online content offerings enable us to generate and collect valuable business information about each member and his or her technology preferences. As registered members access content, we are able to build a profile of their technology interests, and their companies’ interests, as they evolve over time. Through experience, we have identified patterns that are indicative of purchase intent. We leverage this insight to improve ROI on the programs we execute for our clients by focusing specifically where active demand exists. We provide this intelligence directly to IT vendors for their own use. This helps them drive continuous improvement in their own marketing and sales workflows and outcomes, whether focused specifically on prospects we provide them or on those they have otherwise obtained, which our information enriches and makes more actionable.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize Awareness. As a leading distributor of vendor-provided IT white papers, webcasts, videocasts, virtual events and podcasts, we offer IT vendors the opportunity to educate IT and business professionals during the research process, prior to any direct interaction with vendor salespeople. By distributing proprietary content and reaching their target audiences via our platform, IT vendors can educate audiences, demonstrate much of their product capabilities and proactively brand themselves as specific product leaders. As a result, IT and business professionals are more aware of and more knowledgeable about the vendor’s specifications and product and therefore more likely to consider the vendor. Increased consideration of our vendor-customers’ offerings combined with accurate purchase intent insight around those prospects who are actively researching a purchase significantly reduces vendor prospecting costs and time expended on inactive accounts.

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to deliver superior performance by continuously enhancing our position as a global leader in purchase intent-driven marketing and sales services that deliver business impact for enterprise technology vendors by strengthening our offerings in our three core capability areas – our specialized content that connects IT and business professionals with IT vendors in the sectors and sub-sectors that we serve, the purchasing intent insight analytics and data services our content and member traffic enables, and the marketing services we provide to clients to help meet their business growth objectives. In order to achieve this goal, we intend to:

• | Continue to Innovate in the Area of Data-Enabled Marketing Services. We believe our ability to leverage our content and audience to identify in-market prospective buyers is a core competency and a key driver of our future growth. Our IT Deal AlertTM suite of offerings, built on our Activity Intelligence analytic product platform, consists of multiple recently developed products and services that provide IT vendors with data-enabled optimization solutions.

develop our existing product offerings with new features, and launch additional offerings that extend our capabilities based on our customer’s requirements.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Long-term Contractual Relationships with Customers. A number of our newly introduced data-enabled marketing products are being offered to our customers on a subscription basis, on multiple quarter, annual or longer agreements. We intend to expand the number of subscription contracts with our customers, which allows us to work more closely with them in achieving their marketing objectives over an extended period and provide us with stable revenue streams from the continued growth of these products and our successful renewal efforts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand into Complementary Sectors. We intend to complement our current offerings and content by continuing to expand our business in order to capitalize on strategic opportunities in existing, adjacent, or new sectors that we believe to be well-suited to our business model and core competencies. Based on our experience, we believe we are able to capitalize rapidly and cost-effectively on new market opportunities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to Expand Our International Presence. We intend to continue to expand our reach into our addressable market by increasing our presence in countries outside the U.S. We have pursued this strategy by launching our own websites directed at members in the United Kingdom, India, Spain, France, China, Australia, and Singapore, or by acquiring specific properties or companies with attractive properties. We previously expanded by acquiring the Computer Weekly and MicroScope online properties in the United Kingdom and E-Magine Médias SAS, which we call LeMagIT, in France. More recently, we launched German and Portuguese language websites as well as websites directed towards members in Latin America. We expect to further penetrate foreign markets by directly launching additional sector-specific websites directed at these foreign locales and at additional international markets and, if deemed appropriate, by making strategic acquisitions and investments in overseas entities. During 2018, approximately 32% of our revenues were derived from international geo-targeted programs, where our target audience is outside North America. We believe that our integrated product offering across regions continues to resonate with international marketers and is contributing to our successful results. We plan on continuing to invest in these capabilities as we seek opportunities to increase our global reach.

• | Selectively Acquire or Partner with Complementary Businesses. We have used acquisitions in the past as a means of expanding our content and product and service offerings, web traffic and registered members. Our acquisitions to date can be classified into three categories: content-rich blogs or other individually published sites, typically generating less than one million dollars in annual revenues; early stage revenue sites, typically generating between $1 million and $5 million in annual revenues; and later stage revenue sites, typically generating greater than $5 million in annual revenues. During 2018, we acquired substantially all the assets of a company with complimentary data skills for less than $1 million. We intend to continue to pursue selected acquisition or partnership opportunities in our core markets and in adjacent markets for products with similar characteristics.

Market Categories
 Based upon the logical clustering of our members’ respective job responsibilities and the marketing focus of the products being promoted by our customers, we currently categorize our content offerings to address the key market opportunities and audience extensions across a portfolio of distinct market categories. Each of these marketing categories services a wide range of IT vendor sectors and sub-sectors and is driven by the key areas of IT and business professionals’ interests described below:

• | Security. Every aspect of enterprise computing now depends on secure connectivity, data and applications. The security sector is constantly growing to adapt to new forms of threats and to secure new technologies such as mobile devices, wireless networks, virtualized systems and cloud computing solutions. Compliance regulations, cloud computing adoption, and highly publicized identity and intellectual property thefts are driving interest and investment in increasingly sophisticated security solutions that supplement common “perimeter” security solutions such as firewalls and antivirus software. Our online properties in this sector, which include SearchSecurity.com, SearchCloudSecurity.com, SearchFinancialSecurity.com, and SearchMidMarketSecurity.com, offer navigable and structured guides on IT vendor and technology solutions in key sub-sectors such as network security, intrusion defense, identity management and authentication, data and application security, security-as-a-service, cloud security and security information management software.

• | Networking. Broadly defined, the networking market includes the hardware, software and services involved in the infrastructure and management of both Enterprise and Carrier voice and data networks. As new sub-sectors of networking have emerged and grown in importance, IT networking professionals have increasingly focused their investments in such technologies as VoIP, wireless and mobile computing, social networking and collaboration, application performance, data center fabrics, convergence, software-defined networking (“SDN”) and providing cloud services. Our online properties in this sector, which include SearchNetworking.com, SearchEnterpriseWAN.com, SearchUnifiedCommunications.com, SearchSDN.com and SearchTelecom.com, aim to address the specialized needs of these IT networking professionals by offering content targeted specifically to these emerging growth areas.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Storage. The storage sector consists of the market for disk storage systems and tape hardware and software that store and manage data. Growth is fueled by trends inherent in the industry, such as the ongoing need to maintain and supplement data stores, and by external factors, such as expanded compliance regulations and increased focus on disaster recovery solutions. Recent trends reflect an increased emphasis on solid state storage and cloud storage. At the same time, established storage sub-sectors, such as backup and Storage Area Networks (“SANs”) have been invigorated by new technologies such as disk-based backup, continuous data protection, data deduplication and storage virtualization. Our online properties in this sector, which include SearchStorage.com, SearchDataBackup.com, and SearchDisasterRecovery.com, address IT and business professionals seeking solutions in key sub-sectors such as fibre channel SANs, solid state storage, virtualization IP & iSCSI SANs, Network Attached Storage (“NAS”), backup hardware and software, and storage management software.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data Center and Virtualization Technologies. Data centers house the systems and components, such as servers, storage devices, routers and switches, utilized in large-scale, mission-critical computing environments. A variety of trends and new technologies have reinvigorated the data center as a priority among IT and business professionals. Technologies, such as blade servers, server virtualization, converged infrastructure and cloud computing, have driven renewed investment in data center-class computing solutions. Server consolidation is a focus, driven by the decline in large-scale computing prices relative to distributed computing models. These trends have put pressure on existing data center infrastructure and are driving demand for solutions that address this. For example, the deployment of high-density servers has led to increased heat output and energy consumption in data centers. Power and cooling have thus become a significant cost in IT budgets, making data center energy efficiency a priority. Our key online properties in this sector provide targeted information on the IT vendors, technologies and solutions that serve these sub-sectors. Our properties in this sector include sites such as SearchDataCenter.com, covering disaster recovery, power and cooling, mainframe and UNIX® servers, systems management, and server consolidation, and SearchCloudComputing.com and SearchAWS.com, which cover private, public and hybrid cloud infrastructure. SearchServerVirtualization.com covers the decision points and alternatives for implementing server virtualization, while SearchVMware.com focuses on managing and building out virtual environments on the most widely-installed server virtualization platform. SearchConvergedInfrastructure.com covers converged and hyper-converged infrastructure solutions. SearchITOperations covers DevOps, the impact of Agile Development, containers, microservices and event-driven computing upon IT operations, as well as the deployment of hybrid cloud architectures and multi-cloud management.

 We also cover servers, application and desktop solutions deployed in distributed computing environments. The dominant platform, Windows, no longer represents an offering of discrete operating systems but rather a diverse computing environment with its own areas of specialization around IT. As Windows servers have become more stable and scalable, they have taken share in data centers and currently represent one of the largest server sub-sectors. Given the breadth of the Windows market, we have segmented our Windows-focused media based on IT and business professionals’ infrastructure responsibilities and purchasing focus. Our online properties in this sector include SearchWindowsServer.com, covering servers, storage, and systems management; and SearchDomino.com, each targeted toward senior management for distributed computing environments. This network of sites provides resources and advice to IT and business professionals pursuing solutions related to such topics as Windows backup and storage, server consolidation, and upgrade planning. SearchEnterpriseDesktop.com focuses on the deployment and management of end-user computing environments. SearchMobileComputing.com covers the IT management issues surrounding the increasing deployment of personal technologies such as tablets and smartphones in the workplace. Combined with our two properties that focus on server virtualization, SearchVirtualDesktop.com and BrianMadden.com, each focusing on desktop virtualization, gives us a comprehensive offering addressing the fast-growing area of virtualization technologies. 
  
• | CIO/IT Strategy. Our CIO/IT Strategy sites provide content targeted at CIOs, and senior IT executives, enabling them to make informed IT purchases throughout the critical stages of the purchase decision process. CIOs’ areas of interest generally align with the major sectors of the IT market; however, CIOs increasingly are focused on the alignment between IT and their businesses’ operations. Data center consolidation, compliance, ITIL/IT service management, disaster recovery/business continuity, risk management and outsourcing as well as including Software as a Service (“SaaS”) and cloud computing have all drawn the attention of IT executives who need to understand the operational and strategic

implications of these issues and technologies on their businesses. Accordingly, our targeted information resources for senior IT executives focus on ROI, implementation strategies, best practices and comparative assessment of vendor solutions related to these initiatives. Our online properties in this sector include SearchCIO.com, which provides CIOs in large enterprises with strategic information focused on critical purchasing decisions; and SearchCompliance.com, which provides advice on IT-focused regulations and standards to IT and business executives and other senior IT managers. The CIO/IT Strategy category also includes online resources and events targeted to IT decision makers in prominent vertical industries. SearchHealthIT.com provides strategic IT purchasing information and advice to senior IT and clinical professionals in hospitals, medical centers, university health centers and other care delivery organizations, as well as organizations in the life sciences sector.

• | Business Applications and Analytics. Our Business Applications and Analytics market category focuses on mission critical software such as enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), databases and business intelligence, content management enterprise resource planning, and customer facing applications such as customer relationship management (“CRM”) software for mid-sized and large companies. Because these applications are critical to the overall success of the businesses that use them, there is a high demand for specialized information by IT and business professionals involved in their purchase, implementation, and ongoing support. Our applications-focused properties in this sector include sites such as SearchCRM.com, SearchSalesforce.com, SearchOracle.com, SearchSAP.com, SearchHRSoftware.com, SearchSQLServer and SearchERP.com. These sites are leading online resources that provide this specialized information to support mission critical business applications such as CRM, sales force automation, databases and ERP software. The information produced by these applications is seen as a corporate asset that is essential for gaining competitive advantage through informed, data-driven decisions that can help improve operational efficiency, enable business agility, and improve sales effectiveness and customer service. As a result, business intelligence and analytics have become pervasive as various organizations increasingly rely on mission critical information to optimize their businesses. SearchBusinessAnalytics.com, SearchDataManagement.com and SearchContentManagement.com, cover the business intelligence, data management, content management and collaboration disciplines associated with such initiatives. SearchCloudApplications.com focuses on cloud-based or SaaS deployments of key business applications.

• | Application Architecture and Development. The application architecture and development sector is comprised of a broad landscape of tools and languages that enable developers, architects and project managers to build, customize and integrate software for their businesses. Our application architecture and development online properties focus on development in enterprise environments, the underlying languages such as .NET, Java and XML as well as related application development tools and integrated development environments (“IDEs”). Several trends have had a profound impact on this sector and are driving growth. The desire for business agility with more flexible and interoperable applications architecture continues to propel interest in microservices. Application integration, application testing and security, as well as internet and mobile applications are also key areas of continuing focus for vendors and developers Our online properties in this sector include sites such as TheServerSide.com, which hosts independent communities of developers and architects, SearchSoftwareQuality.com, which offers content focused on application testing and quality assurance, and SearchMicroservices.com, which serves Architects, IT Managers and Line of Business Executives who are interested in adapting existing architectures to meet the speed, scale and agility needs of today’s modern applications.

• | Channel. Our Channel sites address the information needs of channel professionals—which we have classified as resellers, value added resellers, solution providers, systems integrators, service providers, managed service providers, and consultants—in the IT market. As IT and business professionals have become more specialized, IT vendors have actively sought resellers with specific expertise in the vendors’ sub-sectors. Like IT and business professionals, channel professionals require more focused technical content in order to operate successful businesses in the markets in which they compete. The resulting dynamics in the IT channel are well-suited to our integrated, targeted content strategy. Our online properties in this sector include SearchITChannel.com and SearchCloudProvider.com. In addition to these websites, TechTarget channel media is able to profile channel professionals accessing information on any website within the TechTarget Network. As channel professionals resell, service and support hardware, software and services from vendors in a particular IT sector, the key areas of focus tend to parallel those for the sub-sectors addressed by our IT-focused properties: for storage, backup, storage virtualization and network storage solutions such as fibre channel SANs, NAS and IP SANs; for security, intrusion defense, compliance and identity management; for networking, wireless, network security and VoIP; for systems, consolidation, cloud, converged infrastructure and server virtualization.

Product and Service Offerings
 We use our offerings to provide IT vendors with numerous touch points to identify, reach and influence key IT decision makers. The following is a description of the products and services we offer:
 IT Deal Alert. IT Deal Alert is a suite of products and services for IT vendors that leverages the detailed purchase intent data that we collect about end-user IT organizations. Through proprietary scoring methodologies, we use this insight to help our customers identify and prioritize accounts whose content consumption around specific IT topics indicates that they are “in-market” for a particular product or service. We also use the data directly to identify and further profile accounts’ upcoming purchase plans.

• | IT Deal Alert: Priority Engine™. Priority Engine is a subscription service powered by our Activity Intelligence platform, which integrates with customer relationship management and marketing automation platforms from salesforce.com, Marketo, Eloqua, Pardot, and Integrate. The service delivers information that enables marketers and sales personnel to identify and understand accounts and individuals actively researching new technology purchases and then to engage those active prospects within the organizations that are relevant to the purchase. We sell this service in approximately 200 technology-specific segments which our customers use for demand generation, account-based marketing and other marketing and sales activities. Priority Engine is also available with specific geographic focus, bringing the total available segments to over 300.

Demand Solutions. Our offerings enable our customers to reach and influence prospective buyers through content marketing programs designed to generate demand for their solutions, and through display advertising and other brand programs that influence consideration by prospective buyers. This allows IT vendors to maximize ROI by capturing sales leads from the distribution and promotion of content to our audience of IT and business professionals. 
 Our demand solutions offerings may include the following program components:
  
• | White Papers. White papers are technical documents created by IT vendors to describe business or technical problems which are addressed by the vendors’ products or services. In a program that includes demand solutions, we post white papers on our relevant websites and our members receive targeted promotions about these content assets. Prior to viewing white papers, our registered members and visitors supply their corporate contact information and agree to receive further information from the vendor. The corporate contact and other qualification information for these leads are supplied to the vendor in near real time through our proprietary lead management software.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Webcasts, Podcasts, Videocasts and Virtual Trade Shows. Webcasts, podcasts, videocasts, virtual trade shows and similar content bring informational sessions directly to attendees’ desktops and mobile devices. As is the case with white papers, our members supply their corporate contact and qualification information to the webcast, podcast, videocast or virtual trade show sponsor when they view or download the content. Sponsorship includes access to the registrant information and visibility before, during and after the event.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Content Sponsorships. IT vendors, or groups of vendors, pay us to sponsor independent editorially created content vehicles on specific technology topics where the registrant information is then provided to all participating sponsors. In some cases, these vehicles are supported by multiple sponsors in a single segment, with the registrant information provided to all participating sponsors. Because these offerings are editorially driven, our customers get the benefit of association with independently created content as well as access to sales leads that are researching the topic.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Brand Solutions. Our suite of brand solutions offerings provides IT vendors exposure to targeted audiences of IT and business professionals actively researching information related to their products and services. We leverage our Activity Intelligence to enable significant segmentation and targeting of specific audiences that can be accessed through these programs. Components of brand programs may include:

• | On-Network Branding. These offerings enable our customers to influence prospective buyers through display advertising purchased on the websites we operate. Programs may include specific sites or audience segments across our sites.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Off-Network Branding. Our Off-Network offerings allow our customers to influence prospective buyers through display advertising when they are visiting other websites on the internet. We identify audience segments that can be targeted based on their activity and demonstrated interests against our content and websites, and offer an array of audience extension and retargeting solutions that leverage Activity Intelligence.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Microsites and Related Formats. We have a range of solutions that create stand-alone websites for IT vendors, or “embedded” websites that exist within the context of our existing websites, to enable a more immersive experience for IT and business professionals with the content and brand messaging of the vendor.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Custom Content Creation. We will at times create white papers, case studies, webcasts or videos to our customers’ specifications through our Custom Content team. These customized content assets are then promoted to our audience within both demand solutions and brand solutions programs.
Customers
 We market to IT vendors targeting specific audiences who are actively researching purchasing decisions. We maintain multiple points of contact with our customers in order to provide support throughout their organization and during critical stages of the sales cycle. As a result, individual customers often run multiple marketing programs with us in order to reach discrete portions of our targeted audience. Our products and services are delivered under both short-term contracts that run for the length of a given marketing program, typically less than six months, and via integrated, longer-term contracts covering various client needs across approximately a year or longer. We have developed a broad customer base and delivered campaigns to approximately 1,300 companies in 2018. During 2018, 2017, and 2016, no single customer represented 10% or more of total revenues.
Sales and Marketing
 We have an internal direct sales department that works closely with existing and potential customers to develop customized marketing programs that provide highly targeted access to IT and business professionals. We organize the sales force by the sector-
 13



specific market categories that we operate and have a global accounts team that works with our largest customers. Additionally, we organize certain individuals into Customer Success Teams. Those teams facilitate the usage and renewal of certain of the Company’s products. We believe that our sector-specific sales organization and integrated approach to our product and service offerings allows our sales personnel to develop a high level of expertise in the specific sectors they cover and to create effective marketing programs tailored to the customer’s specific objectives. As of December 31, 2018, our sales and marketing staff consisted of approximately 320 people. The majority of our sales staff and marketing staff are located in our Newton, Massachusetts, headquarters and our offices in San Francisco, California, and London, England.
 We pursue a variety of marketing initiatives designed to support our sales activities by building awareness of our brand to IT vendors and positioning ourselves as a “thought leader” in ROI-based marketing. These initiatives include purchasing online sponsorships in media vehicles that reach technology marketers, as well as engaging in direct communications with the database of relevant contacts we have built since inception. Examples of our direct communications include selected e-mail updates on new product launches and initiatives. We also produce videocasts, blogs and white papers for technology marketers where we provide information on the latest best practices in the field of online business-to-business (“B2B”) tech marketing.
 Through our Analyst Relations, Press and Public Relations activities, we develop and maintain relationships with key analysts, publications and influencers covering B2B marketing and sales topics.
 Online Member Acquisition
 Our primary source of traffic to our websites is through non-paid traffic sources, such as our existing registered member base and organic search engine traffic. Organic search engine traffic is also the primary source of new registered members for our sites. Because our sites focus on specific sectors of the IT market, our content is highly targeted and is an effective means for attracting search engine traffic and from this, growing our membership. We also make marketing expenditures designed to supplement our non-paid traffic and registered members. We employ a variety of online marketing vehicles such as keyword advertising on the major search engines and targeted list rentals of opt-in e-mail subscribers from a variety of targeted media sources.
Technological Infrastructure
 We have developed an expandable operations infrastructure using hardware and software systems from established IT vendors to maintain our websites and online offerings. Our system hardware is co-located at an offsite data center. All of the critical components of the system are redundant, allowing us to withstand unexpected component failure and to undergo maintenance and upgrades. Our infrastructure is scalable, enabling us to make additions that fit into the existing environment as our system requirements grow based on traffic and member growth. Our critical data is copied daily to an online backup storage solution. The data is also copied to an off-site online storage facility. We maintain a quality assurance process to constantly monitor our servers, processes and network connectivity. We have implemented these various redundancies and backup systems in order to minimize the risk associated with damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, computer viruses and other events beyond our control. We believe that continued development of our technological infrastructure is critical to our success. We have made, and expect to continue to make, technological improvements in this infrastructure to improve our ability to service our members and customers.
Competition
 The market for IT vendor marketing spend is highly competitive, and in each of the sectors we serve, as well as across the products and services we offer, our primary competitors include media companies that produce content specifically for IT and business professionals, providers of technology-based point solutions for data analysis and other service providers. Our primary media competitors, each of which possesses substantial resources to compete, are J2 Global, Madison Logic, QuinStreet, International Data Group, and CBS Interactive/CNET. In the online market we generally compete on the basis of target audience, quality and uniqueness of information content, ease of use of our websites for IT and business professionals, and the quality and quantity of sales leads generated for IT vendors. We also compete for the members who comprise our target audiences primarily with the media companies that produce content specifically for IT and business professionals such as J2 Global, QuinStreet, International Data Group, and CBS Interactive/CNET. In the data-oriented businesses, we compete with providers of predictive analytics and internet-based analysis including companies like 6sense, Infer, Bombora and Aberdeen. In general marketing services, we compete with list and lead providers of various types. As we continue to expand internationally, we expect to compete with many of the competitors mentioned above, as well as with established media companies based in particular countries or geographical regions.

Member Privacy
 We gather in-depth business information about our registered members who consent to provide us such information through one or more of the online registration forms displayed on our websites. We also gather information about users of certain content on our websites by tracking their content consumption or the content consumption of the companies they work for. We post our privacy policy on our websites so that our members can access and understand the terms and conditions applicable to the collection and use of their information. Our privacy policy discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how a member can correct or change this information, including how a member can unsubscribe to our communications and those of our partners. Our privacy policy also explains the circumstances under which we share a member's information and with whom. Members who register for our websites have the option of indicating specific areas of interest in which they are willing to receive offers via e-mail or postal mail; these offers contain content created either by us or our third-party IT vendor customers. To protect our obligations to our members, we impose constraints that are consistent with our privacy policy on the customers to whom we provide member data. Additionally, when we provide lists to third parties, including to our customers, it is under contractual terms that are generally consistent with our obligations to members set forth in our privacy policy, as well as in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Consumer Protection Regulation
 General. Advertising and promotional activities presented to visitors on our websites are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices. We are also subject to various other federal and state consumer protection laws, including the ones described below. With respect to our non-U.S. business, we are also subject to the laws and regulations of various other jurisdictions in which we target members.
 CAN-SPAM Act. The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (the “CAN-SPAM Act”) regulates commercial e-mails and provides a right on the part of the recipient to request the sender to stop sending messages, and establishes penalties for the sending of e-mail messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. Under the CAN-SPAM Act, senders of commercial e-mails (and other persons who initiate those e-mails) are required to make sure that those e-mails do not contain false or misleading transmission information. Commercial e-mails are required to include a valid return e-mail address and other subject heading information so that the sender and the internet location from which the message has been sent are accurately identified. Recipients must be furnished with an electronic method of informing the sender of the recipient’s decision not to receive further commercial e-mails. In addition, the e-mail must include a postal address of the sender and notice that the e-mail is an advertisement. The CAN-SPAM Act may apply to the e-newsletters that our websites distribute to registered members and to some of our other commercial e-mail communications. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) has issued regulations related to the CAN-SPAM Act, including interpretations of such act that indicate that e-newsletters, such as those we distribute to our registered members, will be exempt from most of the provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act. At this time, we are applying the applicable CAN-SPAM requirements to e-newsletters and all other e-mail communications, and believe that our e-mail practices comply with the requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act.
 Other Consumer Protection Regulation. The FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to require that the online collection, use and dissemination of data, and the presentation of web site content, comply with certain standards for notice, choice, security and access. In many cases, the specific limitations imposed by these standards are subject to interpretation by courts and other governmental authorities, and courts may adopt these developments as law. In addition, the FTC has published principles to address consumer privacy issues that may arise from so-called “behavioral targeting” (i.e. the tracking of a member’s online activities in order to deliver advertising tailored to his or her interests) and to encourage industry self-regulation for public content. Although the FTC excluded from the principles both “first-party” behavioral advertising and contextual advertising (each being the types of behavioral targeting activities in which we are currently primarily engaged), with respect to other types of behavioral targeting that include the storage of more, and potentially sensitive, data or that collects information outside of the “traditional Web site context” (such as through a mobile device or by an ISP), the FTC has stated that it will continue to evaluate self-regulatory programs. Further, the FTC has indicated that it is considering regulations regarding behavioral targeting which may include implementation of a more rigorous opt-in regime. An opt-in policy would prohibit businesses from collecting and using information obtained through behavioral targeting activities from individuals who have not voluntarily consented. The FTC has also issued further clarifying guidance regarding consumer privacy and data collection with a particular focus on the mobile environment. A few states have also introduced legislation that, if enacted, would restrict or prohibit behavioral advertising within the state. In the absence of a federal law pre-empting their enforcement, such state legislation would likely have the practical effect of regulating behavioral advertising nationwide because of the difficulties behind implementing state-specific policies or identifying the location of a particular consumer.
 Privacy. In addition, the European Union (“EU”) and its member states and Canada and California have laws, rules and/or regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their citizens. Regulations have focused on, among other things, the collection, use, disclosure and security of information that may be used to identify or that actually identifies an 
 15



individual, such as an e-mail address, a name, or an IP address. Additionally, the EU requires informed consent for the placement of a cookie on a user device.
 We believe that we are operating our business in compliance with the regulations that apply to us. However, such laws may be modified or subject to interpretation by governmental agencies or the courts, or, new laws may be enacted in the future, all of which could impact our business and results of operations.
 Intellectual Property
 We regard our copyrights, domain names, trademarks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secrets laws, as well as confidentiality agreements with our employees and others, and protective contractual provisions, to protect the proprietary technologies and content that we have developed. We pursue the registration of our material trademarks in the U.S. and elsewhere. Currently, our TechTarget trademark and logo, as well as certain other marks and logos, are registered in the U.S. with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in select foreign jurisdictions and we have applied for U.S. and foreign registrations for various other marks. In addition, we have registered over 1,600 domain names that are, or may be, relevant to our business, including “www.techtarget.com,” “www.knowledgestorm.com,” “www.bitpipe.com,” and those leveraging the “search” prefix used in the branding of many of our websites. We also incorporate a number of third-party software products into our technology platform pursuant to relevant licenses. We use third-party software to maintain and enhance, among other things, the content generation and delivery, and support our technology infrastructure. We are not substantially dependent upon these third-party software licenses, and we believe the licensed software is generally replaceable, by either licensing or purchasing similar software from another vendor or building the software functions ourselves.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 647 employees. Other than a small number of employees in the United Kingdom and France, none of our current employees are represented by a labor union or are the subject of a collective bargaining agreement.
Seasonality
 The timing of our revenues is affected by seasonal factors. Our revenues are seasonal primarily as a result of the annual budget approval process of many of our customers, the normal timing at which our customers introduce new products, and the historical decrease in marketing activity in summer months. The timing of revenues in relation to our expenses, much of which do not vary directly with revenues, has an impact on the cost of online revenues, selling and marketing, product development and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in each calendar quarter during the year.
 The majority of our expenses are personnel-related and include salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and incentive-based compensation plan expenses. As a result, we have not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in the timing of our expenses period to period.
