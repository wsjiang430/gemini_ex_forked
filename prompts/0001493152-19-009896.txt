By enabling the marriage of technology and knowledge, we are able to deliver innovative solutions directly to individuals around the world. Personal and general financial instruction and information are largely overlooked in all levels of education. An ongoing cycle of debt accumulation, inability to save, lack of planning, and inadequate knowledge on how to cultivate our “capital” is passed from generation to generation.
 
By creating easy access, focused tutorials, and step-by-step planning, our education and technology tools provide individuals with the necessary information to understand the power of proper utilization of money along with the ability to design their own path toward financial fitness.

CRYPTO Mining Packages—We offer cryptocurrency mining packages that consist of computer/GPU hardware and operation and maintenance services to provide individuals access to cryptocurrency mining. Our mining hardware (hosting) facility is arranged through a contractual partnership and located in Romania. Each GPU processing card is specific to the package purchased and is individually serial numbered, and the customer may request his or her hardware to be shipped to him or her at any time. There is no guarantee or estimate of mining output provided as mining conditions change constantly and cryptocurrency is subject to a number of risks associated with emerging markets. We believe our mining services, which are physically housed, monitored, and maintained in a dedicated facility, eliminate variables associated with other mining services that are typically cloud-based.
 
Equity Markets—Our equity market education with alerts is our core offering and brings the knowledge and expertise of individuals who have been involved in the market for years directly to the user. Our equity services are now included in every subscription service. Our market experts provide the financial technology, education, and research that allow the user to make decisions concerning his or her money in the market.

SAFETek
 
SAFETek, LLC (formerly WealthGen Global, LLC) is a new addition that we are currently establishing for expansion plans in the high-speed processing computing space. SAFETek will deploy a large-scale processing operation that is used for any of the following intense processing activities: protein folding, CGI rendering, game streaming, machine and deep learning, mining, independent financial verification, and general high-speed computing. Key trending markets for data computation include Internet of Things, Smart Homes, smart cities, smart devices, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, virtual reality, 3D animation, and health technology data to name a few.
 
Our Vision
 
We envision an ongoing integration of the latest technologies with emerging needs to deliver leading edge products and services worldwide.
 
Distribution Method
 
We use an affiliate model to sell our product subscriptions. Anyone with an interest can participate in our bonus plan, which rewards them for selling product subscriptions. We believe this component of our offering is extremely powerful as it provides an additional income stream for the customer who decides to become a distributor. Individuals are much more comfortable discussing financial matters with people they know. The network becomes a support system for the customers as they learn together and share their experiences. The affiliate distribution model, while powerful, requires strict policies and procedures to ensure the company’s presentation and messaging are accurate and compliant. An affiliate/distributor is not required to be a customer to sell our products.
Competition
 
We face competition for each of our product categories, but do not have a similar competitor with the full suite of services offered. Each of the financial education products, alerts, tools, and newsletters face competition from similar product companies such as TheStreet.com, The Motley Fool, Jim Cramer, and like subscription-based financial research services. The personal money management education and tools face competition from free mobile apps designed for the same purpose although our personal money management does not advertise or entice the user to refinance or secure new loans and is a pure management tool that serves the individual and not the advertiser. Our tax management tools and education have limited competition, and we have deployed Deductr Pro as our tool of choice. Unique to our company is not the individual product but the combined suite of products for one monthly subscription price, cancellable at any time by the user and distributed exclusively by the active members through the optional bonus plan for those who choose to sell the service to others.
 
We believe our competitive advantages include:
 

● | a generous bonus program for independent affiliates; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | a management team with extensive experience in financial education and market strategy research/technology; 
● | a young and motivated distributor base; 
● | a large demographic that services all genders, races, religions, and nationalities; and 
● | a delivery platform enabling us to launch new products quickly and efficiently worldwide. 

 
Our competitive weaknesses include translation challenges as we continue international expansion and components of our distributor backend that are programmed by third-party providers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success is predicated on the adoption of new and innovative technology, education, and research along with constantly improving convenience tools. The delivery of alerts and financial information through our platform provides various levels of automation that is programmed and designed by us exclusively for our products and modified to enable the individual to initiate action on alerts they desire. We own the intellectual property for many of our products strategies and platform delivery mechanisms while we make other products available through licensed arrangements. In this way, we can continually offer a full suite of “best of breed” services to ensure our members are receiving the most value and leading-edge programs for their monthly subscription.

Expansion
 
We are in the process of expanding the business internationally. International planning and restructuring is taking place as a result of the recent name change to Kuvera. Our affiliated entity, WG LATAM S.A.S., which has been reestablished to Kuvera LATAM S.A.S., distributes tour products and services in Colombia and surrounding Latin American countries. International operations can be impacted by international regulations and economic conditions, although all are continuously monitored.
Government Regulation
 
We have historically positioned the company as a knowledge provider and educator that seeks to augment a user’s informed decision-making process, rather than to act as a conductor of investment decisions or a representative of investment services. As such, most of our activities do not fall within the scope of securities industry regulation. Most of our products and services also do not require that any representative distributing our services conduct themselves as an investment advisor or broker. However, our subsidiary S.A.F.E. Management, LLC, recently received its registration and disclosure approval from the National Futures Association. S.A.F.E. Management, LLC is now a New Jersey State Registered Investment Adviser (“RIA”), Commodities Trading Advisor (“CTA”), and Commodity Pool Operator registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), and is approved by the CFTC for over the counter FOREX advisory services. As a New Jersey-registered RIA, we are required to comply with New Jersey’s laws and regulations governing the activities of investment advisers and the fees they can charge, as well as certain provisions of the Investment Adviser Act of 1940. As a CFTC registered CTA, Commodity Pool Operator, and FOREX adviser, we are required to comply with federal law and CFTC rules regulating those activities.
 
We have established these registrations and the advisory structure to offer automated trade execution, which is managed by S.A.F.E. Management, LLC, in its capacity as an RIA, for equities and equity options and in its capacity as a CTA for commodities, futures, and OTC Forex. In addition, SAFE provides traditional advisory services for clients who do not wish to trade for themselves. Automation of trades is only available through S.A.F.E. Management. No additional approvals are required for any of our current business activities. The cost of maintaining this additional regulated entity could have a material adverse effect on our business and could subject us to regulatory enforcement actions.
 
We are subject to government regulation in connection with securities laws and regulations applicable to all publicly owned companies as well as laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally. We are also increasingly subject to governmental regulation and legislation specifically targeting Internet companies, such as privacy regulations adopted at the local, state, national and international levels and taxes levied at the state level. Due to the increasing use of the internet, enforcement of existing laws, such as consumer protection regulations, in connection with web-based activities has become more aggressive, and it is expected that new laws and regulations will continue to be enacted at the local, state, national, and international levels. Such new legislation, alone or combined with increasingly aggressive enforcement of existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance and business.
 
Employees
 
As of June 27, 2019, we had 32 employees.
