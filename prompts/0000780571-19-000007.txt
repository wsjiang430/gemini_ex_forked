General
Itron enables utilities and cities to safely, securely and reliably deliver critical infrastructure services to communities in more than 100 countries. Our proven portfolio of smart networks, software, services, devices, and sensors helps our customers better manage their operations in the energy, water, and smart city space. We are among the leading technology and services companies offering end-to-end device solutions, networked solutions, and outcomes-based products and services. Our comprehensive offerings measure, manage, and provide data analytics and services to utilities and municipalities that enable them to responsibly and efficiently manage resources.
We have over 40 years of experience in supporting utilities and municipalities in the management of their data and critical infrastructure needs. Incorporated in 1977 with a focus on meter reading technology, we entered the electricity meter manufacturing business with the acquisition of Schlumberger Electricity Metering in 2004. In 2007, we expanded our presence in global meter manufacturing and systems with the acquisition of Actaris Metering Systems SA. In 2017, we completed our acquisition of Comverge by purchasing the stock of its parent, Peak Holding Corp. (Comverge), which enabled us to offer integrated cloud-based demand response, energy efficiency, and customer engagement solutions. In 2018, we strengthened our ability to deliver a broader set of solutions and to increase the pace of growth and innovation in the utility, smart city, and Industrial Internet of Things markets with the acquisition of Silver Spring Networks, Inc. (SSNI).
The following is a discussion of our major products, our markets, and our operating segments. Refer to Item 7: "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8: "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for specific segment results.
Our Business 
We are a technology and service company, who is a leader in the Industrial Internet of Things, offering solutions that enable utilities and municipalities to safely, securely and reliably operate their critical infrastructure. Our solutions include the deployment of smart networks, software, services, devices, sensors, and data analytics that allow our customers to manage assets, secure revenue, lower operational costs, improve customer service, improve safety, and enable efficient management of valuable resources. Our comprehensive solutions and data analytics address the unique challenges facing the energy, water, and municipality sectors, including increasing demand on resources, non-technical loss, leak detection, environmental and regulatory compliance, and improved operational reliability.
We offer a portfolio of products, software, and services to our customers that can be a standalone, one-time purchase or an end-to-end solution that can be reoccurring over multiple years. The portfolio includes hardware products used for measurement, control, or sensing with and without communications capability; a combination of endpoints and network infrastructure designed 
and sold as a complete solutions for the purpose of robustly acquiring and transporting application specific data; value added services, software, and products that organize, analyze and interpret data for the purpose of gaining insights, making decisions, and informing actions. We offer managed services, software-as-a-service (SaaS), technical support services, licensing hardware technology, and consulting services.
Industry Drivers
Utility and municipalities are in the middle of an evolution of how they operate critical infrastructure, manage scarce resources, and interact with their customers. Efficiently managing resources within energy, water, and cities is a top priority globally, as increasing populations and resource consumption continues to stress an aging infrastructure. The growing demand for energy, water, and municipal services coupled with the proliferation of renewable energy sources, smart communicating devices, sensors, and multiple data producing technologies is forcing providers to rethink how they operate and service their communities. This evolution comes at a time when utilities and municipalities are challenged by cost constraints, regulatory requirements, environmental concerns, safety, and resource scarcity. Itron provides its customers with a solution-based offering to safely, securely, and reliably optimize their critical infrastructure to improve the efficiency of their services and to better understand their customers with near real-time knowledge of their resource usage. An added benefit of our solutions is the utility or municipality can empower their customers to understand and have control over their resource usage, allowing for better management and conservation of valuable resources.
Our Operating Segments
We operate under the Itron brand worldwide and manage and report under three operating segments. Effective October 1, 2018, we reorganized our operational reporting segmentation from Electricity, Gas, Water, and Networks to Device Solutions, Networked Solutions, and Outcomes. As part of our reorganization, we actively integrated recent acquisitions and implementing an organizational structure that aligns with the new segments. In conjunction with the rollout of our new operating segments, we unified our go-to-market strategy with a single, global sales force, which sells the full portfolio of Itron solutions, products, and services. We manage our product development, service delivery, and manufacturing operations on a worldwide basis to promote global, integrated oversight of our operations and to ensure consistency and interoperability between our operating segments. The reorganization of the business segments allows us to more effectively serve our customers and compete in our industry. The following discussion provides a description of each of the three segments:
Device Solutions - includes hardware products used for measurement, control, or sensing that do not have communications capability embedded for use with our broader Itron systems, i.e., products where Itron is not offering the complete "end-to-end" solution, but only the hardware elements. Examples of the Device Solutions portfolio include basic meters that are shipped without Itron communications, such as our standard gas meters, electricity IEC meters, and water meters, in addition to our heat and allocation products; communicating meters that are not a part of an Itron solution such as the Linky meter; and the implementation and installation of non-communicating devices, such as gas regulators.
Networked Solutions - includes a combination of communicating devices (smart meters, modules, endpoints, and sensors), network infrastructure, and associated application software designed and sold as a complete solution for acquiring and transporting robust application-specific data. Networked Solutions combines, into one operating segment, the majority of the assets from the recently acquired SSNI organization with our legacy Itron networking products and software and the implementation and installation of communicating devices into one segment. This includes: communicating measurement, control, or sensing endpoints such as our Itron® and OpenWay® Riva meters, Itron traditional ERT® technology, Intelis smart gas or water meters, 500G gas communication modules, 500W water communication modules; GenX networking products, network modules and interface cards; and specific network control and management software applications. Solutions supported by this segment include automated meter reading (AMR), advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), smart grid and distribution automation (DA), and smart street lighting and smart city solutions.
Outcomes - includes our value-added, enhanced software and services operating segment in which we manage, organize, analyze, and interpret data to improve decision making, maximize operational profitability, drive resource efficiency, and deliver results for consumers, utilities, and smart cities. Outcomes places an emphasis on delivering to Itron customers high-value, turn-key, digital experiences by leveraging the footprint of our Device Solutions and Networked Solutions segments. The revenues from these offerings are primarily recurring in nature and would include any direct management of Device Solutions, Networked Solutions, and other products on behalf of our end customers. Examples of these offerings include our meter data management and analytics offerings; our managed service solutions including network-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service, forecasting software and services; and any consulting-based engagement. Within the Outcomes segment, we also identify new business models, including performance-based contracting, to drive broader portfolio offerings across utilities and cities.
Bookings and Backlog of Orders
Bookings for a reported period represent customer contracts and purchase orders received during the period for hardware, software, and services that have met certain conditions, such as regulatory and/or contractual approval. Total backlog represents committed but undelivered products and services for contracts and purchase orders at period-end. Twelve-month backlog represents the portion of total backlog that we estimate will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Backlog is not a complete measure of our future revenues as we also receive significant book-and-ship orders, as well as frame contracts. Bookings and backlog may fluctuate significantly due to the timing of large project awards. In addition, annual or multi-year contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the long-term nature of the contracts. Beginning total backlog, plus bookings, minus revenues, will not equal ending total backlog due to miscellaneous contract adjustments, foreign currency fluctuations, and other factors. Total bookings and backlog include certain contracts with termination for convenience clause, which will not agree to the total transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations disclosed in Item 8: "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18: Revenues".

Year Ended | Total Bookings | | Total Backlog | | 12-Month Backlog
 | (in millions) 
December 31, 2018 | $ | 2,515 | | | $ | 3,173 | | $ | 1,349
December 31, 2017 | 1,993 | | | 1,750 | | | 931
December 31, 2016 | 2,066 | | | 1,652 | | | 761

Sales and Distribution
We use a combination of direct and indirect sales channels in our operating segments. A direct sales force is utilized for large electric, natural gas, and water utilities, with which we have long-established relationships. For smaller utilities, we typically use an indirect sales force that consists of distributors, sales representatives, partners, and meter manufacturer representatives.
No single customer represented more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Our 10 largest customers in each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, accounted for approximately 31%, 33%, and 31% of total revenues, respectively.
Manufacturing
Our products require a wide variety of components and materials, which are subject to price and supply fluctuations. We enter into standard purchase orders in the ordinary course of business, which can include purchase orders for specific quantities based on market prices, as well as open-ended agreements that provide for estimated quantities over an extended shipment period, typically up to one year at an established unit cost. Although we have multiple sources of supply for many of our material requirements, certain components and raw materials are supplied by limited or sole-source vendors, and our ability to perform certain contracts depends on the availability of these materials. Refer to Item 1A: "Risk Factors," for further discussion related to supply risks.
Our manufacturing facilities are located throughout the world, an overview of which is presented in Item 2: "Properties". While we manufacture and assemble a portion of our products, we outsource the manufacturing of certain products to various manufacturing partners. This approach allows us to reduce our costs as it reduces our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust more quickly to changing end-customer demand. These partners assemble our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish and procure components and assemble our products based on demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions, as adjusted for overall market conditions.
Partners
In connection with delivering products and systems to our customers, we may partner with third-party vendors to provide hardware, software, or services, e.g., meter installation and communication network equipment and infrastructure. Our ability to perform on our contractual obligations with our customers is dependent on these partners meeting their obligations to us. Refer to Item 1A: "Risk Factors," for further discussion related to third-party vendors and strategic partners.
Product Development
Our product development is focused on both improving existing technology and developing innovative new technology for electricity, natural gas, water and heat meters, sensing and control devices, data collection software, communication technologies, data warehousing, software applications, and the Industrial Internet of Things. We invested approximately $208 million, $169 million, and $168 million in product development in 2018, 2017 and 2016, which represented 9% of total revenues for 2018, 8% of total revenues for 2017 and 2016.
Workforce
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 8,000 people in our workforce, including 6,700 permanent employees. We have not experienced significant employee work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
Competition
We enable utilities and cities to safely, securely, and reliably deliver critical infrastructure services to communities in more than 100 countries. Our portfolio of smart networks, software, services, meters, and sensors help our customers better manage electricity, gas, water, and city infrastructure resources for the people they serve. Consequently, we operate within a large and complex competitive landscape. Some of our competitors have diversified product portfolios and participate in multiple geographic markets, while others focus on specific regional markets and/or certain types of products, including some low-cost suppliers based in China and India. Our competitors in China have an increasing presence in other markets around the world; however, excluding the Asia Pacific region this competition does not represent a major market share in our global operating regions. Our competitors range from small to large established companies. 
We believe that our competitive advantage is based on our in-depth knowledge of the industries we serve, our capacity to innovate, and our ability to provide complete end-to-end integrated solutions. We are a global leader in the Industrial Internet of Things category, a leader the industry in communication modules deployed, a leading industry innovator, a leader in electricity, gas and water end-to-end solutions, and a global leader in meters under managed services. We continue to serve our established customer relationships, and expand upon our track record of delivering reliable, accurate, and long-lived products and services. Refer to Item 1A: "Risk Factors" for a discussion of the competitive pressures we face.
Our primary competitors include the following: 

Global Competitors | | Regional Competitors

Strategic Alliances
We pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce product advancement and acceleration of entry into new markets. The objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following: technology exchange, product development, joint sales and marketing, or access to new geographic markets. Refer to Item 1A: "Risk Factors" for a discussion of risks associated with strategic alliances.
Intellectual Property
Our patents and patent applications cover a range of technologies, which relate to standard metering, smart metering solutions and technology, meter data management software, knowledge application solutions, and Industrial Internet of Things. We also rely on a combination of copyrights, patents, and trade secrets to protect our products and technologies. Disputes over the ownership, registration, and enforcement of intellectual property rights arise in the ordinary course of our business. While we believe patents and trademarks are important to our operations and, in aggregate, constitute valuable assets, no single patent or trademark, or group of patents or trademarks, is critical to the success of our business. We license some of our technology to other companies, some of which are our competitors.
Environmental Regulations
In the ordinary course of our business we use metals, solvents, and similar materials that are stored on-site. We believe that we are in compliance with environmental laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the operation of our business.
