BUSINESS.


Corporate History
 
Hoops Scouting USA was incorporated on October 31, 2016 under the laws of the State of Wyoming. Hoops Scouting USA is a basketball scouting website for high school basketball players with aspirations of playing post-secondary basketball to upload stats. It is also an avenue for smaller university coaches who do not have the means to recruit larger areas of the United States and Internationally.
 
We are in the development stage, and have not realized any revenues from our operations. Jamie Oei has served as our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer since our inception. Our board of director is comprised of one person: Jamie Oei. Our officer and director, Jamie Oei, currently lives in Canada, and our current assets are located in the United States. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets. We are not a blank check registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, since we have a specific business plan or purpose. We have not had preliminary contact or discussions with, nor do we have any present plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with any representatives of the owners of any business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger.
 
From inception until the date of this Report, we have had limited operating activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company, development of our business plan, opening a bank account, the initial equity funding by our officers and directors, and registering and launching our website. We received our initial funding of $50 through the sale of common stock from our officer and director, who purchased 500,000 shares of common stock at $0.0001 per share.
 
We are a development stage company which is in the business of providing a website for high school basketball players with aspirations of playing post-secondary basketball. It is also an avenue for smaller university coaches who do not have the means to recruit larger areas of the United States and Internationally. Hoops Scouting USA will allow high school players to set up accounts, which include game film, schedules for high school and AAU games, stats, and high school academic marks. This will allow coaches to be able to see players and their stats and can plan their recruiting with the team schedules. This brings international recruiting to the desk of every college coach in the United States from Division 1, Division 2, Divisions 3, NAIA, and Junior College.

To implement our business plan, we require a minimum funding of $36,000 over the next twelve months. After twelve months period, we may need additional financing. If we do not generate any revenue, we may need a minimum of $7,700 of additional funding to pay for legal and accounting fees, and for costs associated with being a “reporting issuer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended SEC filing requirements. Our officer and director, has agreed to loan the company funds, however, he has no firm commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company and there is also no guarantee that he will continue to loan the funds to the company in the future as well. We have no revenues and have incurred losses since inception.
 
Our operations to date have been devoted primarily to startup and development activities, which include: (i) formation of the Company; (ii) development of our business plan; (iii) opening a bank account; (iv) the initial equity funding by our officer and director; and (v) registering and launching our website.
 
Our products and products description
 
Hoops Scouting USA is a basketball website for high school basketball players with aspirations of playing post-secondary basketball. It is also an avenue for smaller university coaches who do not have the means to recruit larger areas of the United States and Internationally.
 
Hoops Scouting USA will allow high school players to set up accounts which include game film, schedules for high school and AAU games, stats, and high school academic marks. This will allow coaches to be able to see players and their stats and can plan their recruiting with the team schedules. This brings international recruiting to the desk of every college coach in the United States from Division 1, Division 2, Divisions 3, NAIA, and Junior College.
 
This also allows players from Europe, Australia, Asia, and South America to pursue opportunities in the United States to schools that would normally not be able to recruit in such a wide range. Many of the larger schools with bigger recruiting budgets are often the only ones to be able to see these international players. Often only the top players get a chance and the second and third tier players do not get a chance to be recruited. This will all change with Hoops Scouting USA.
 
The website will be the main hub but being able to upload stats and game film directly from a smart phone will allow players and coaches to get almost immediate information. Development of an app to allow this will eventually work in unison with the website.
 
Revenue will be split between several revenue streams. 
 
1. 
Player Membership  
 
a. 
Players sign up for full memberships which allow players to upload unlimited videos to or website and app 
 
b. 
Players sign up for partial memberships to upload one or two videos at a time.  
 
2. 
Coaching Membership - Coaches sign up to receive emails and check players.  
 
3. 
Sponsorship- Website and app will have sponsors who can display their ads on videos or on the website or the app. Sponsors can receive info from the company on what pages and what videos are being viewed the most.  
 
A small fee for players and coaches will be invoked but sponsorship on the website and the app will be the main source of revenue.
 
Current market trend
 
College-basketball fans’ insatiable (and Internet-fueled) desire for information about up-and-coming players has made high-school-hoops scouting a big business. And corporate America has taken notice. According to New York Magazine, Fox acquired Scout.com, which primarily covers college basketball and football recruiting, for $60 million. Two years later, Yahoo bought Scout.com’s main competitor, Rivals.com, for $100 million. This shows the significant growth of the industry of recruitment and data tracking.
 
A Stanford Business Article titled “Five Key Trends That Are Driving the Business of Sports” explains that the data are changing the way the game is played, shifting emphasis from how many total points a player scores to measures of player efficiency. “It has been hard, historically, to quantify defense,” said Brian Kopp, senior vice president of STATS, the company that developed SportVU player tracking. “Now we have four camera views helping you do that.” In addition, the data have influenced the types of shots players take on the court. All sports are at that point where, like in a lot of businesses, they’re using a lot of (data) to make better decisions.

Marketing
 
Our officer and director will promote our scouting service. We plan to market our products through the following methods: (i) our website, (ii) search engine optimization, (iii) social networking websites, (iv) printing, mailing and emailing catalogues and flyers to potential customers, (v) word of mouth, (vi), telephoning potential customers (vii) content marketing and (viii) paid ads. We hope to have repeat customers coming and buying new products online from our website.
Competition
 
There are many well established companies in our industry. We expect to face medium to high level of resistance, and it will be up to our marketing efforts and negotiation skills to acquire customers. Most of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we do and will be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we are. We also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Insurance
 
We do not maintain any insurance as of the date of this prospectus.
 
Employees
 
We are a development stage company and currently have no employees. Our sole officer and director manages the day-to-day operations of the Company.
 
Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities in the future. As of now there are no required government approvals present that we need approval from or any existing government regulation on our business.
 
Patents, trademarks and copyrights
 
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks. We intend to protect our website with copyright laws. Beyond our trade name, we do not hold any other intellectual property.
 
Bankruptcy or similar proceedings
 
There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.
 
“Shell” Company Status
 
The proposed business activities described herein classify us as a “shell” company. The Securities and Exchange Commission and certain states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations regarding the sales of securities of shell companies, as well as limitations on a shareholder’s ability to sell their “restricted” securities. Rule 144 is not available to a shareholder of a shell company unless and until the Company files a registration statement with the SEC that includes certain specific information about existing business operations of a registrant and thereafter must wait an additional one year to take advantage of that exemption from registration. 
 
Rule 12b-2 of the 34 Act defines a shell company as a company that has:
 
(1) 
No or nominal operations; and 
 
(2) 
Either: 
 
(i) 
No or nominal assets; 
 (ii) 
Assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or 
 (iii) 
Assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. 
 
We will continue to file all reports required of us under the Exchange Act until we organically build our business from cash raised from investors. No assurance can be given that this will occur or, if it does, for how long.
