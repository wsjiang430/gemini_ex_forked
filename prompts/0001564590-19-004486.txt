Notes referenced throughout this document refer to consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures that are found in Item 8.
 The Company was formed in 1968 as an Oklahoma corporation and became a Delaware corporation in 1977. We manufacture and market chemical products for the agricultural, industrial and mining markets.  We own and operate facilities in El Dorado, Arkansas (the “El Dorado Facility”), Cherokee, Alabama (the “Cherokee Facility”), and Pryor, Oklahoma (the “Pryor Facility”), and we operate a facility for Covestro AG (“Covestro”) in Baytown, Texas (the “Baytown Facility”).  Our products are sold through distributors and directly to end customers throughout the United States.
 Our Business
 Our business manufactures products for three principal markets:
  
• | ammonia, fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate (“AN” and “HDAN”) and urea ammonia nitrate (“UAN”) for agricultural applications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | high purity and commercial grade ammonia, high purity AN, sulfuric acids, concentrated, blended and regular nitric acid, mixed nitrating acids, carbon dioxide, and diesel exhaust fluid (“DEF”) for industrial applications; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | industrial grade AN (“LDAN”) and AN solutions for mining applications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 The products we manufacture at our facilities are primarily derived from natural gas (a raw material feedstock).  Our facilities and production processes have been designed to produce products that are marketable at nearly each stage of production.  This design has allowed us to develop and deploy a business model optimizing the mix of products to capture the value opportunities in the end markets we serve with a focus on balancing our production. 
 The chart below highlights representative products and applications in each of our end markets.
 
 
End Market | Products | Applications 
Agricultural | UAN, HDAN, ammonia | Fertilizer and fertilizer blends for corn and other crops; NPK fertilizer blends


Industrial Acids and Other | Nitric acid, metallurgical and commercial grade ammonia, sulfuric acid, diesel exhaust fluid and other urea solutions, Specialty E-2 ammonium nitrate, CO2 | Semi-conductor and polyurethane intermediates, ordnance; Pulp and paper, alum, water treatment, metals and vanadium processing; Power plant emissions abatement, water treatment, refrigerants, metals processing; Exhaust stream additive, horticulture / greenhouse applications; refrigeration

Prior to July 1, 2016, we manufactured and sold a range of heating, ventilation and air conditioning products and related services (the “Climate Control Business”).  These products were primarily used in commercial, institutional and residential new building construction and renovations.  On July 1, 2016, we sold the Climate Control Business.
 For information regarding our net sales, operating results and total assets for the past three fiscal years, see the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
 Our Strategy
 We pursue a strategy of balancing the sale of product as fertilizer into the agriculture markets at spot prices or short duration pre-sales and developing industrial and mining customers that purchase substantial quantities of products, primarily under contractual obligations and/or pricing arrangements that provide for the pass through of some raw material and other manufacturing costs.  We believe this product and market diversification strategy allows us to have more consistent levels of production compared to some of our competitors and helps reduce the volatility risk inherent in the prices of our raw material feedstock and/or the changes in demand for our products. 
 The strategy of developing industrial and mining customers helps to moderate the risk inherent in the agricultural markets where spot sales prices of our agricultural products may not have a correlation to the natural gas feedstock costs but rather reflect market conditions for like and competing nitrogen sources.  This volatility of sales pricing in our agricultural products may, from time to time, compromise our ability to recover our full cost to produce the product.  Additionally, the lack of sufficient non-seasonal agricultural sales volume to operate our manufacturing facilities at optimum levels can preclude us from balancing production and storage capabilities. Looking forward, we continually pursue profitable growth and margin enhancement.  Our strategy calls for continued emphasis on the agricultural sector, while remaining committed to further developing industrial customers who assume the volatility risk associated with the raw material costs and mitigate the effects of seasonality in the agricultural sector.
 Our strategy also includes evaluating acquisitions of strategic assets or companies, mergers with other companies and investment in additional production capacity where we believe those acquisitions, mergers or expansion of production capacity will enhance the value of the Company and provide appropriate returns.
 Key Operating Initiatives for 2019
 We believe our future results of operations and financial condition will depend significantly on our ability to successfully implement the following key initiatives:
  
• | Improving the On-Stream Rates of our Chemical Plants. Over the past 18 months, our focus has been on upgrading our existing maintenance management system through technology enhancements and work processes to improve our predictive and preventative maintenance programs at our facilities. We engaged outside maintenance experts to assist us in expediting implementation and overall use. We have completed the initial implementation. Additionally, beginning in the third quarter of 2018, we engaged outside consultants to do a thorough review of our operating and maintenance procedures and our preventive maintenance programs at all of our facilities in an effort to determine where we may have gaps in procedures and programs and where we may need enhancements. Based on the “Gap Analysis” completed, we have several initiatives underway that we believe will improve the overall reliability of our plants and allow us to produce more products for sale while lowering our cost of production. Those initiatives are focused on operating behavior and procedure enhancements including operator training, leadership training, shift change enhancements and operating and maintenance procedures. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on the Continued Improvement of Our Safety Performance. We believe that high safety standards are critical and a precursor to improved plant performance. With that in mind, we implemented enhanced safety programs at our facilities that focus on reducing risks and improving our safety culture. As a result of these programs, we significantly lowered our recordable incident rate in 2018 as compared to the prior year and we remain well below the national average for recordable safety incidents. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Continue Broadening of the Distribution of our Products. We increased our overall sales volume of HDAN over the past 24 months by approximately 30% through various marketing initiatives which include: (1) storing and distributing HDAN at our Pryor Facility which allows us to sell to new markets and customers out of that facility and; (2) educating growers on the agronomic benefits and the additional applications for HDAN. To further leverage our plants current production capacity, we are continuing to expand the distribution of our mining products by partnering with customers to take product further into the Western U.S. as well as markets outside the U.S. We also partnered with a current customer to position an emulsion explosives plant at our El Dorado Facility. We began selling product to that facility in the fourth quarter of 2018. We will continue to explore further guest plant opportunities at our facilities in 2019. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, through increased marketing efforts, we increased our sales volumes of nitric acid over the past 24 months by approximately 35%.  We continue to focus our efforts to expand our market for our nitric acid products in North America and to fully utilize available nitric acid production capacity of our facilities. 
  
• | Improving the Margins on Sales of Our Products. Over the last several years, we have focused on increasing our sales volumes to produce at optimal on-stream rates and lower our manufacturing costs per ton of product. In 2019, we will undertake a review of all sales to customers to determine if there are opportunities to improve the margins on sales to those customers and to explore if there are further product upgrading opportunities. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continued Focus on Procurement and Logistics. In 2018, we engaged outside experts to assist us in centralizing and expanding our Company-wide procurement efforts. We completed our initial areas of focus during the second quarter of 2018, completed the implementation of those changes, and began to see benefits during the third quarter of 2018. We believe that these efforts along with several additional identified areas of focus, will result in an overall reduction in expenses and capital spend in the aggregate of between $3 million to $5 million on an annualized basis, which we expect to realize over the next 12 to 24 months. Additionally, we will continue to focus on improving the effectiveness and overall cost of our logistics strategy through a centrally managed team focused on building logistics partners that will help us further drive efficiencies in 2019. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on Improving Our Capital Structure and Overall Cost of Capital. We are actively seeking ways to improve our capital structure and reduce our overall cost of capital. We believe that the improving end markets for our products combined with our improved operating performance will be a benefit in achieving those efforts. As a part of that, in the second quarter of 2018, we refinanced our outstanding Senior Secured Notes. We will continue to actively seek ways to improve our capital structure going forward. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We may not successfully implement any or all of these initiatives.  Even if we successfully implement the initiatives, they may not achieve the results that we expect or desire.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 Strategically Located Chemical Assets and Long-Standing Customer Relationships
 Our business benefits from highly advantageous locations with logistical and distribution benefits.  We have access to the ammonia pipeline from the U.S. Gulf at our El Dorado Facility, which provides low cost transportation to distribution points.  The El Dorado Facility also has rail access that is in close proximity to our HDAN customers and cost advantaged when selling a number of our products West of the Mississippi River.  Our Cherokee Facility is located East of the Mississippi River, allowing it to reach customers that are not freight logical for others.  Our Cherokee Facility sits adjacent to the Tennessee River, providing barge delivery access, in addition to truck and rail delivery access.  Our Pryor Facility is located in the heart of the Southern Plains with close proximity to the Port of Catoosa along with strategic rail and truck delivery access. 
Advantaged Raw Material Cost Position
 We currently produce ammonia at our El Dorado, Cherokee and Pryor Facilities, which allows us to take advantage of the spread between producing and purchasing ammonia at those facilities.  Additionally, our Pryor Facility has a natural gas cost advantage as its cost of gas has historically been lower than our El Dorado and Cherokee Facilities.  
Diversified Sources of Revenue
 Our business serves a broad range of end markets, which we believe diminishes the cyclicality of our financial performance.  Our business serves the agricultural, industrial and mining markets.  The flexible nature of our production process allows us the ability to shift our product mix based on end market demand. 
Operation of Multiple Facilities and High Production Capacity 
 We operate our business through several facilities.  Operating multiple facilities diversifies the risk and impact of operational issues that may occur at a single plant, which gives us a strategic advantage over competitors that operate their company through a single facility.  Additionally, our competitive production capacity of our combined plants allows us to decrease manufacturing costs, helping us to achieve enhanced margins.

Market Conditions
 As discussed in more detail under “Key Industry Factors” of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) contained in Item 7 of this report, agricultural fertilizer demand is a significant driver of our sales volumes.  This demand is influenced by the number of acres planted of crops, principally corn, that require fertilizer to grow and to enhance yield.  Corn prices and those of soybean, cotton and wheat prices, affect the number of acres of corn planted in a given year, and the number of acres planted will influence nitrogen fertilizer consumption, likely affecting ammonia, UAN and urea prices.  Weather also has an effect on fertilizer application and consumption.  Industry reports indicated China’s recent tariffs placed on U.S. soybeans could result in a shift of 2 to 4 million acres that will be rotated from soybeans to corn in this next planting season. The USDA also estimates an increase in 2019 corn acres that is in line with other industry reports ranging between 92 million to 93 million acres. Soybean pricing concerns may drive crop planting selection when final crop choices are made at the farm level. The following February estimates are associated with the corn market: 

 | 2019 Crop | | 2018 Crop | | Percentage | 2017 Crop | | | Percentage |

 In our industrial markets, our sales volumes are typically driven by changes in general economic conditions, energy prices, and our contractual arrangements with certain large customers.  Our mining products are generally sold into the coal and metals and mineral mining markets and are also used in the production of stone for construction and production of cement for quarrying operations.  As such, U.S. annual coal production will drive sale volumes of our mining products and over the past several years, U.S. coal production has been negatively impacted by low natural gas prices among other things.  As reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), annual coal production in the U.S. for the full year of 2018 was down 3% from 2017 due to this market’s weak competitive position in the electrical generation sector compared with natural gas and to a lesser degree lower export demand.  EIA is forecasting another 3% decrease in U.S. coal production in 2019 followed by a continued decline of 7% in 2020.  This estimated decline is based on the continual shift in utility-scale electricity generation from coal to natural gas.  We believe that coal production in the U.S. continues to face significant challenges from competition from natural gas and renewable sources of energy.  While we believe our plants are well located to support the more stable coal-producing regions in the upcoming years, our current mining sales volumes are being affected by overall lower customer demand for LDAN.  As part of our continued effort to expand sales of our mining products, we entered into an agreement with a current customer, by which the customer has located an emulsion explosives plant at our El Dorado Facility.  We will continue to explore further guest plant opportunities in 2019.
 On the supply side, given the low price of natural gas in North America over the last several years, North American fertilizer producers have become the global low-cost producers for delivered fertilizer products to the Midwest U.S.  Several years ago, the market believed that low natural gas prices would continue.  That belief, combined with favorable fertilizer pricing, stimulated investment in numerous expansions of existing nitrogen chemical facilities and the construction of new nitrogen chemical facilities. Since those announcements, global nitrogen fertilizer supply has outpaced global nitrogen fertilizer demand causing oversupply in the global and North American markets.  The increased fertilizer supply led to lower nitrogen fertilizer sale prices during most of 2017.  Also, additional domestic supply of ammonia and other fertilizer products changed the physical flow of ammonia in North America placing pressure on ammonia and other fertilizer prices until the distribution system accepted the new supply.  Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 and through 2018, we have seen an increase in fertilizer prices as imports of fertilizers have decreased significantly and the distribution of the new domestic supply of fertilizer has been established.  We expect this trend to continue in 2019.
 Agricultural Products 
 We produce and sell UAN, HDAN and ammonia, all of which are nitrogen-based fertilizers.  We sell these agricultural products to farmers, ranchers, fertilizer dealers and distributors primarily in the ranch land and grain production markets in the U.S.  Our nitrogen-based fertilizers are used to grow food crops, biofuel feedstock crops, pasture land for grazing livestock and forage production.  We maintain long-term relationships with wholesale agricultural distributors and retailers and also sell directly to agricultural end-users through our network of wholesale and retail distribution centers.

The price at which our agricultural products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers which, in turn, depends upon world grain demand and production levels, the cost and availability of transportation and storage, weather conditions, competitive pricing and the availability of imports.  Additionally, expansions or upgrades of competitors’ facilities and internationals and domestic political and economic developments continue to play an important role in the global nitrogen fertilizer industry economics.  These factors can affect, in addition to selling prices, the level of inventories in the market which can cause price volatility and affect product margins. 
 We develop our market position in these areas by emphasizing high quality products, customer service and technical advice.  During the past few years, we have been successful in expanding outside our traditional markets by delivering to distributors on the Tennessee and Ohio rivers by barge, and by delivering to certain Western States by rail.  See our discussion above concerning broadening the distribution of our AN products under “Key Operating Initiatives for 2019”.
 In addition, we have an agreement with a third-party purchaser, Coffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers, LLC, (“CVR”), to market and sell a portion of our UAN.  Demand for sales under this agreement is based on the expected needs of the purchaser’s customers.  The agreement provides the exclusive right (but not the obligation) to purchase, at market prices, substantially all of the UAN produced at our Pryor Facility.  The term of the agreement runs through May 2019, with automatic one-year extensions, subject to a 180-day advance notice of termination from CVR or a 90-day advance notice from us.
 We sell most of our agricultural products at the current spot market price in effect at the time of shipment, although we periodically enter into forward sales commitments for some of these products.  Sales of our industrial and mining products are generally made to customers pursuant to sales contracts or pricing arrangements on terms that include the cost of the primary raw materials as a pass-through component in the sales price.  These contractual sales stabilize the effect of commodity cost changes and fluctuations in demand for these products due to the cyclicality of the end markets.
 Industrial Acids and Other Chemical Products
 We manufacture and sell industrial acids and other chemical products primarily to the polyurethane, paper, fibers, emission control, and electronics industries.  In addition, we produce and sell blended and regular nitric acid and industrial and high purity ammonia for many specialty applications, including the reduction of air emissions from power plants.  In addition, one of our subsidiaries, El Dorado Chemical Company (“EDC”) and Koch Fertilizer LLC (“Koch Fertilizer”) are parties to an ammonia purchase and sale agreement, under which Koch Fertilizer agreed to purchase, with minimum purchase requirements, the ammonia that is in excess of EDC’s internal needs.  We began selling ammonia under this agreement during June 2016.  The term of the agreement runs until June 2020, with annual renewal options.
We operate the Baytown Facility on behalf of Covestro and we believe it is one of the largest and most technologically advanced nitric acid manufacturing units in the U.S.  We operate and maintain this facility pursuant to a long-term contract (the “Covestro Agreement”). The term of this agreement runs until June 2021 with options for renewal.  See discussion concerning the impact from the adoption of ASC 606 in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
 Our industrial products sales volumes are dependent upon general economic conditions primarily in the housing, automotive, and paper industries.  Our sale prices generally vary with the market price of ammonia, sulfur or natural gas, as applicable, in our pricing arrangements with customers. 
 Our industrial business competes based upon service, price and location of production and distribution sites, product quality and performance and provides inventory management as part of the value-added services offered to certain customers.  See our discussion above concerning broadening the distribution of our nitric acid products under “Key Operating Initiatives for 2019”.
 Mining Products 
 We produce and sell LDAN and AN solution to the mining industry, which products are primarily used as AN fuel oil and specialty emulsions for surface mining of coal, mining of precious metals and for usage in quarries and providing aggregates to the construction industry.  We have signed long-term contracts with certain customers that provide for the annual sale of LDAN under various natural-gas-based pricing arrangements.  Additionally, during 2018 we entered into an agreement to have a current customer locate an emulsion explosives plant at our El Dorado Facility.  We began selling product to that facility during the fourth quarter of 2018.  We continue to explore further guest plant opportunities.  See our discussion above concerning broadening the distribution of our mining products under “Key Operating Initiatives for 2019”.
 Raw Materials
 The products we manufacture at our facilities are primarily derived from natural gas.  This raw material feedstock is a commodity and subject to price fluctuations. Natural gas is the primary raw material for producing ammonia, UAN, nitric acid and acid blends and other products at our El Dorado, Cherokee and Pryor Facilities.  When operating at optimum on-stream rates, the El Dorado Facility would purchase approximately 16.6 million MMBtus of natural gas annually to produce approximately 470,000 tons of ammonia; the Cherokee Facility would purchase approximately 5.8 million MMBtus of natural gas annually in order to produce approximately 
 7


180,000 tons of ammonia; and the Pryor Facility would purchase approximately 7.0 million MMBtus of natural gas annually to produce approximately 235,000 tons of ammonia.
 The chemical facilities’ natural gas feedstock requirements are generally purchased at spot market price.  Periodically, we enter into volume purchase commitments and/or futures/forward contracts to lock in the cost of certain of the expected natural gas requirements primarily to match quantities needed to produce product that has been sold forward.  As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any volume purchase commitments with a fixed cost for natural gas.
 See further discussion relating to the outlook for our business under “Key Industry Factors”.
 Regulatory Matters
 We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations as discussed under “Environmental, Health and Safety Matters" of this Item 1 and various risk factors under Item 1A.
Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive market with many other larger chemical companies, such as Austin Powder Company, CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Chemtrade Logistics Inc., EuroChem, Inc., OCI Partners NV, Dyno Nobel, a subsidiary of Incitec Pivot Limited, The Gavilon Group, Helm AG, Koch Industries, Norfalco, Nutrien (formerly known as Agrium and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan), Praxair, Inc., Trammo Inc. and Yara International (some of whom are our customers), many of whom have greater financial and other resources than we do.  We believe that competition within the markets we serve is primarily based upon service, price, location of production and distribution sites, and product quality and performance.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 576 persons, 193 of whom are represented by unions under agreements that expire in July of 2019 through July of 2021. 
 Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
 Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and to other laws regarding health and safety matters (the “Environmental and Health Laws”), many of which provide for certain performance obligations, substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations.  Certain Environmental and Health Laws impose strict liability as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released.  We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken.  In connection with certain acquisitions, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses.  In certain instances, citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws, or to challenge our ability to receive environmental permits that we need to operate.  In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety effects of our operations.
 There can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in complying with such laws or in paying fines or penalties for violation of such laws.  Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us.  The Environmental and Health Laws and enforcement policies thereunder have in the past resulted, and could in the future result, in significant compliance expenses, cleanup costs (for our sites or third-party sites where our wastes were disposed of), penalties or other liabilities relating to the handling, manufacture, use, emission, discharge or disposal of hazardous or toxic materials at or from our facilities or the use or disposal of certain of its chemical products.  Historically, our subsidiaries have incurred significant expenditures in order to comply with the Environmental and Health Laws and are reasonably expected to do so in the future.  We will also be obligated to manage certain discharge water outlets and monitor groundwater contaminants at our chemical facilities should we discontinue the operations of a facility.
