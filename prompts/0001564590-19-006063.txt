Item 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 We provide precision-policing and security solutions for law enforcement and security personnel to help deter gun violence and make cities, campuses and facilities safer. Our flagship public safety solution, ShotSpotter Flex, is the leading outdoor gunshot detection, location and alert system. Our newly-acquired patrol management software, ShotSpotter Missions (formerly HunchLab), creates crime forecasts designed to enable more precise and effective use of patrol resources to deter crime. Our security solutions, ShotSpotter SecureCampus and ShotSpotter SiteSecure, are designed to help law enforcement and security personnel serving universities, corporate campuses and key infrastructure or transportation centers mitigate risk and enhance security by notifying authorities of a potential outdoor gunfire incident, saving critical minutes for first responders to arrive. Our gunshot detection solutions are trusted by 100 cities as of December 31, 2018.
 Our gunshot detection solutions consist of highly-specialized, cloud-based software integrated with proprietary, internet-enabled sensors designed to detect outdoor gunfire. The speed and accuracy of our gunfire alerts enable law enforcement and security personnel to reduce their response times to shooting events, which can increase the chances of apprehending the shooter, providing timely aid to victims, and identifying witnesses before they scatter, as well as aid in evidentiary collection and serve as an overall deterrent. When a potential gunfire incident is detected by our sensors, our system applies machine learning combined with a human review to analyze and validate the incident and precisely locate where the incident occurred. An alert containing a location on a map and critical information about the incident is transmitted directly to subscribing law enforcement or security personnel through any internet-connected computer and to iPhone or Android mobile devices. 
 Our software transmits validated gunfire data along with a recorded digital file of the triggering sound to our Incident Review Center (“IRC”), where our trained acoustic experts are on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year to screen and confirm actual gunfire incidents. Our acoustic experts can supplement alerts with additional tactical information, such as the potential presence of multiple shooters or the use of high-capacity weapons. Gunshot incidents reviewed by our IRC result in alerts typically sent within 45 seconds of the gunfire incident. 
 We generate annual subscription revenues from the deployment of ShotSpotter Flex on a per-square-mile basis. Our security solutions, ShotSpotter SecureCampus and ShotSpotter SiteSecure, are typically sold on a subscription basis, each with a customized deployment plan. Our ShotSpotter Missions solution pricing is under development, but will also be subscription based. As of December 31, 2018, we had ShotSpotter Flex, ShotSpotter SecureCampus and ShotSpotter SiteSecure coverage areas under contract of approximately 670 square miles, of which 648 square miles had gone live as of December 31, 2018. These coverage areas included 100 cities and 10 campuses/sites across the United States and in South Africa, including three of the ten largest cities in the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2018, substantially all of our revenues are attributable to customers based in the United States.
 We are a mission-driven organization focused on earning the trust of law enforcement to help them provide equal protection to all and strengthen the police-community relationship, ultimately reducing gun violence. Our inspiration comes from our principal founder, Dr. Bob Showen, who believes that the highest and best use of technology is to promote social good. We are committed to developing comprehensive, respectful and engaged partnerships with law enforcement agencies, elected officials and communities focused on making a positive difference in our society.
 Industry Background: The Problem of Gun Violence 
 According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (the “FBI”), an estimated 1.2 million violent crimes occurred in the United States in 2017. Of those violent crimes, it is estimated that firearms were used in 72.6% of murders, 40.6% of robberies and 26.3% of aggravated assaults. A March 2016 report published by The American Journal of Medicine stated that the gun homicide rate in the United States is more than 25 times the average of other high-income countries. 
 2

There is a staggering economic cost associated with gun violence. A 2015 study commissioned by Mother Jones, an independent news organization, found that gun violence costs the American economy at least $229 billion every year, inclusive of $8.6 billion in direct expenses such as for emergency and medical care. 
 The Challenge of Urban Gun-Related Crime 
 The majority of urban gunfire goes unreported. A report published by The Brookings Institute analyzing data collected from our ShotSpotter Flex and our customers suggests that approximately 90% of the gunshots detected by our public safety solution are not reported to 911 by residents. Even in the instances when 911 calls are made, the information reported by the caller is often incomplete or inaccurate as to the time and location of the gunshot. Furthermore, in many cases it is often difficult for the caller to authenticate the incident as gunfire. In addition, we believe that in communities plagued by gun violence, there is often a lack of trust between the community’s residents and its police force, which can exacerbate the underreporting of gunfire and create a vicious cycle of underreporting, lack of response and increased mistrust due to continued unaddressed gun violence in the community. When gunfire is not reported or is reported inaccurately, law enforcement and medical personnel cannot address injuries nor effectively investigate and solve related crimes or prevent future incidents. 
 The communities in which gun violence occurs suffer significant economic loss. A 2016 report by the Urban Institute, which studied the effect of gun violence in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Oakland, California and Washington, D.C., noted that the perceived risk of gun violence imposed heavy social, psychological and monetary damages in communities, including in the forms of fewer jobs and lower economic vitality. The study concluded: 
  
• | In Minneapolis, one fewer gun homicide in a given year was statistically associated with the creation of 80 jobs and an additional $9.4 million in sales across all business establishments in the next year.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In Oakland, every additional gun homicide in a given year was statistically associated with five fewer job opportunities in contracting businesses in the next year.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In Washington, D.C., every additional gun homicide in a given year was statistically associated with two fewer retail and service establishments the next year.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, several studies have suggested that property values are inversely correlated with violent crime. For example, the Center for American Progress conducted a study of changes in homicide incidents and housing prices in Boston, Massachusetts; Seattle, Washington; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Milwaukee, Wisconsin and found that a reduction in a given year of one homicide in a ZIP code causes a 1.5% increase in housing values in that same ZIP code the following year. 
 The Rise of Active-Shooter Events 
 In addition to the problem of localized, persistent gun violence, over the past several years there has been an increasing number of high-profile mass shootings and terror events. According to a 2016 report by the FBI, the number of active-shooter events in the United States in 2014 and 2015 was among the highest for any two-year average period in the preceding 16 years and nearly six times as many as the period between 2000 and 2001, the first two years that the FBI began tracking active-shooter events. 
 Unlike gunfire incidents occurring in high-crime areas, active-shooter events often result in a high volume of telephone reports to 911. However, each caller may provide untimely, inaccurate or incomplete information, causing confusion or delays in first responders’ ability to react quickly and accurately. Response time is critical as nearly 70% of active-shooter events last five minutes or less with over one third ending in two minutes or less according to a 2013 study conducted by the FBI of active-shooter events.

Our Market 
 We believe there is significant demand for advanced gunfire detection and location notification solutions that accurately and quickly report instances of gunfire, based on two primary use cases: 

• | law enforcement— for domestic and international law enforcement serving communities plagued by persistent, localized gun violence, in order to identify, locate and deter gun violence; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | security— for security personnel (which may include law enforcement personnel) serving universities, corporate campuses, key infrastructure, transportation centers and other areas in which authorities desire to prepare for and mitigate risks related to an active-shooter event, and desire to provide a zone of detection coverage surrounding the respective campus or secured area.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on data from the 2015 FBI Uniform Crime Report, we estimate that the domestic market for our public safety solution consists of the approximately 1,400 cities that had four or more homicides per 100,000 residents in 2015. The Uniform Crime Report includes information reported directly to the FBI on a voluntary basis by 18,000 city, university and college, county, state, tribal and federal law enforcement agencies. We believe that four or more homicides per 100,000 residents represents a significant gun violence problem. We estimate that a customer in this market could invest an average of approximately $400,000 per year for ShotSpotter Flex. 
 Outside of the United States, we estimate that the market for our ShotSpotter Flex includes approximately 200 cities in the European Union, Central America, the Caribbean, South America and southern Africa that have at least 500,000 residents. We estimate that a customer in this market could invest an average of approximately $1.0 million per year for our public safety solution. 
 We estimate the average investment amounts for prospective customers based on our experience with existing customers, our anticipated demand for our solutions and the corresponding coverage areas that we expect prospective customers would elect to cover with our solutions. 
 Based on data made available by the National Center for Education Statistics and the Federal Aviation Administration, we believe that the domestic market for our security solutions includes approximately 5,000 college campuses and airports. We estimate that, on average, a customer in this market could invest approximately $50,000-$75,000 per year for one of our security solutions. In addition, we believe that there exists a broader market for our security solutions that include, primarily the outdoor areas of college campuses and airports outside of the United States as well as large corporate campuses, train stations and other highly-trafficked areas worldwide. 
 We also believe there is a demand for our ShotSpotter Missions within our existing ShotSpotter Flex customers and within police departments in the same cities we target for our gunshot detection solutions, as it designed to help police departments strategically plan patrol missions and tactics for more effective crime deterrence. We estimate that the market for our ShotSpotter Missions solution includes approximately 1,500 cities, based on cities that have a population above 25,000 people. Our Missions solution pricing will be subscription based. We expect a customer to invest approximately $50,000 per year for our ShotSpotter Missions solution.

• | ShotSpotter SecureCampus. ShotSpotter SecureCampus helps the law enforcement and security personnel serving universities, colleges and other educational institutions mitigate risk and enhance security by notifying authorities and first responders of an active-shooter event, involving outdoor gunfire, almost immediately, and provide “dome of protection” outside the campus where our coverage areas extends.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ShotSpotter SiteSecure. ShotSpotter SiteSecure is designed to serve customers such as corporations trying to safeguard their facilities and public agencies focused on protecting critical infrastructure, including train stations, airports and freeways.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The key features of our gunshot detection solutions are: 
  
• | Comprehensive Coverage. We believe that we sell the only public safety solution that provides comprehensive outdoor coverage for gunshot detection over large and complex acoustic environments. Our outdoor acoustic sensors are strategically placed in an array of 20 to 30 sensors per square mile and can easily be expanded to cover any size area. In addition to providing acoustic surveillance over wide areas, our solutions operate on a continuous basis—24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year—to provide immediate notification of gunfire at any time of day.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Real-Time, Precise Alerts. Our solutions typically notify users within 45 seconds of a gunshot, providing data on the time and location of the shooting and the number of shots fired. An alert is sent depicting a dot on a map that corresponds to a specific address or latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates. In addition, our alerts provide valuable additional information about the scene of the incident, such as the potential presence of multiple shooters or the use of fully automatic and high-capacity weapons. This enhanced tactical awareness can help protect first responders in dangerous and unpredictable situations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Forensically-Sound Data. Because our outdoor solutions provide an exact time, location and audio recording of a gunshot, we are able to provide authorities with critical evidence for investigations and prosecutions. Our Detailed Forensic Reports, or DFRs, provide law enforcement personnel and prosecutors with comprehensive, court-admissible analysis of a shooting incident including the gunfire audio. We also offer expert witness testimony to introduce the forensic analysis of the DFRs at trial and to provide technical expertise regarding our technology. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed 747 DFRs for outdoor gunshot incidents, and during 2018, our evidence was requested for use in approximately 106 federal and state cases, including 25 trials in which we provided expert witness testimony.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Annual Subscription to a Cloud-Based Solution. We provide our solutions as an annual subscription-based service in which we design, deploy, own, manage and maintain the acoustic sensors, host the software and gunshot data and operate our IRC with trained acoustic experts. Occasionally we receive customer requests for direct purchase of our sensors in conjunction with the purchase of our subscription service. We evaluate each of these requests on a case by case basis.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The key benefits provided by these features of our gunshot detection solutions include: 
  
• | Expedited Response to Gunfire. In 2018, we issued more than 112,000 gunshot alerts to our customers. In areas where gun violence is persistent, we believe most gunshots are not otherwise reported. Even when calls are made, many callers are unable to provide a location of the gunshot or other relevant details. Human response time to unfolding violence often delays calls for several minutes in circumstances where response time can be critical. By contrast, our solutions typically alert emergency dispatch centers and field personnel within 45 seconds of confirmed gunfire and provide an exact location, enabling them to respond faster and to a specific location. The ability to respond more quickly increases the chances of apprehending the shooter and assisting victims of violence, in addition to aiding in evidentiary collection.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prevention and Deterrence of Gun Violence. We believe increasing the speed and accuracy of law enforcement responses to gunfire can act as a long-term deterrent that can decrease the overall prevalence of gunfire. We also believe that knowledge of the existence of our solutions may have a deterrent effect on localized gun violence. When elected officials and law enforcement have an enhanced awareness of gun violence activity and patterns, they have tools to facilitate a rapid and accurate response to gunfire incidents and improve relations between law enforcement and these communities, potentially increasing
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

crime reporting and community cooperation with investigations, which can result in improved public safety.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved Community Relations and Collaboration. We believe that persistent gun violence limits the ability of police and other community leaders to serve their constituents and improve their communities. Many cities struggle to establish and foster a cooperative and trusting relationship between their police department and the communities they serve. Our public safety solution provides cities with the ability to react quickly to gun violence, thus providing the ability to improve their responses and residents’ perception of their responses. This provides our customers with the opportunity to foster improved community relations and collaboration with their residents.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved Police Officer Safety. We believe that our solutions provide additional and valuable information regarding gunshot incidents as the alerts we provide give additional insight and situational awareness, including, in the case shots fired outdoors, round count, potential multiple shooters and use of an automatic weapon, that allow the responders to be better prepared to respond appropriately.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease to Procure and Use. By delivering our solution as a cloud- and subscription-based service, our customers do not need to design, install or maintain their own complex infrastructure or hire or train acoustic experts to continuously manage such a solution. We offer consultative ongoing on-boarding, best practices and tactical training support to our customers to insure they derive the full value of implementing our solution.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Integration Capability. We can customize the integration of our solutions with existing customer systems, including video management systems, computer-aided dispatch, records management systems, video analytics, automated license plate number readers, camera management systems, crime analysis and statistics packages (including the COMPSTAT software tools commonly used by police departments) and common operating picture software. Interfacing with our alerts can enhance the effectiveness of these customer tools by providing information such as precise latitude and longitude (geolocation), timestamps, incident audio and situational context. For example, police in Minneapolis, Minnesota used our alerts to trigger video recordings of certain key intersections in high crime areas and capture the image of a suspect fleeing the scene of a shooting. Similarly, in Boston, Massachusetts, police correlate our data with surveillance cameras and parolee ankle bracelet tracking data to monitor parolees who may be violating parole terms by committing crimes or consorting with criminals.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gun Violence Data Collection. We believe that we have amassed the world’s largest and most accurate collection of urban gunshot data. We provide our public safety customers with detailed gun crime pattern analysis for their coverage areas as well as access to additional data that can assist them with further analytics. This information provides an awareness of gunshot activity that may otherwise go unreported. For example, by collecting information regarding the time and location of otherwise unreported gunfire, our customers can become aware of patterns of violence in the community. This increased awareness can help our customers create policy, allocate appropriate resources and help to address pervasive problems in high gun-activity areas.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The key features and key benefits of ShotSpotter Missions solution include:
  
• | Crime Forecasting and Mission Planning. Our ShotSpotter Missions and the associated machine learning systems can provide crime forecasting and mission planning to enable more precise deployment of patrol resources, and report on mission activity and tactics for command staff. Missions also provides agencies the flexibility to select which crime types to forecast and weight them based on police and community priorities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tactical Mission Confirmation. Tactical missions can be configured with police input, and effectively communicate predictions to police staff of discrete areas of high risk for particular crime types. The key benefit of ShotSpotter Missions is its ability to help police departments to strategically plan patrol missions and tactics for more effective crime deterrence with focused, directed and visible patrol presence.

Strategy 
 We intend to drive growth in our business by continuing to build on our position as a leading provider of outdoor gunshot detection solutions. Key elements of our strategy include: 

• | Accelerate Our Acquisition of Public Safety Customers. We believe that we continue to be in the early stages of penetrating the markets for our public safety solutions. We count law enforcement agencies in three of the ten largest U.S. cities among our ShotSpotter Flex customers, all of which were added within the last three years. We expanded our direct sales force and customer success team in 2017 and in 2018 added marketing lead-generation capabilities to accelerate growth in this market. Moreover, as we add new public safety customers, publicity and the number of potential references for our solutions increase, which results in our brand and our solutions becoming more well known. We intend to capitalize on this momentum to drive an increase in sales.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Our International Footprint. With only one currently deployed ShotSpotter Flex customer outside of the United States in South Africa and we just signed a contract in early 2019 with the Bahamas, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand internationally. We estimate that the market outside the United States for our public safety solutions includes approximately 200 cities in the European Union, Central America, the Caribbean, South America and southern Africa that have at least 500,000 residents. In addition, we believe that there is a market for our security solutions and ShotSpotter Missions outside the United States that includes primarily the outdoor areas of college campuses and airports, as well as large corporate campuses, train stations and other highly-trafficked areas. We intend to invest in our international sales and marketing efforts to reach these customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand ShotSpotter Flex Revenue within Our Existing Customer Base. As customers realize the benefits of our solutions, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to increase the lifetime value of our customer relationships by expanding coverage within their communities through a “land and expand strategy”. For example, of our ShotSpotter Flex customers, approximately 40% have expanded their coverage areas from their original deployment areas by an average of ten square miles, as of December 31, 2018. Our overall revenue retention rate has been over 100% for each of 2018, 2017 and 2016.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drive Additional Revenue per Customer with the Development or Acquisition of New Products and Services. We evaluate opportunities to develop or acquire complementary products and services. For example, our acquisition of HunchLab, renamed ShotSpotter Missions, in 2018 provides an opportunity to increase our revenue per customer with a related and value-added technology that helps deter crime through strategically planned patrol missions. Our initial focus is to leverage trusted relationships with current customers to drive initial adoption, and increase revenue and lifetime value per customer.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Partner with “Smart Cities” Initiatives Providers. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to partner with providers of “Smart Cities” initiatives. For example, we have partnered with GE Current and Verizon to incorporate our gunshot detection solutions into intelligent street lights in areas not otherwise covered by our solutions. By incorporating our solutions into these initiatives, we believe we can increase our customer base, expand our footprint with those customers and deploy our solutions at a reduced cost to us. These partnerships provide new and incremental go-to market strategies we believe we can use to accelerate market penetration for our services over time.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain Passionate Focus on Customer Success and Net Promoter Score. Given the specialized nature of our market, a key component of our strategy is to maintain our passionate focus on customer success and satisfaction. We pride ourselves on our execution of customer on-boarding as well as ongoing consulting and customer support, all of which are critical to ensure not only high customer retention rates, but new customer acquisitions. We implement our customer success initiative early in the sales process in order to ensure that we are aligned with the customer’s objectives and can positively impact their defined outcomes. We apply consultative best practices and policy development at the command staff level as well as tactical training for field patrol officers. We also consistently measure our performance with customers through an annual Net Promoter Survey. We have extremely high agency participation rates and our scores the last two years have ranked between “excellent” and “world class” according to our Survey partner benchmarks. All of our efforts are focused on driving positive measurable outcomes

Integrated Platform 
 Our gunshot detection solutions provide for the complete integration of several complex components- intelligent sensors, networking infrastructure, and enterprise software and computing resources — in an easy-to-adopt and affordable annual subscription that eliminates the need for our customers to design, install or maintain their own complex infrastructure or hire or train acoustic experts to monitor continuously the solution. 
 We believe that offering these solutions as a service on an annual subscription basis is cost-effective, provides for more resilient, redundant infrastructure and significantly reduces friction during customer adoption by eliminating the complexity and front-loaded capital expenditure associated with perpetual licenses for on-site technology projects. Our sensors operate on machine-to-machine networks and, because we maintain thousands of live sensor connections, we are able to aggregate usage for all of our customers and negotiate lower rates from communications service providers than a single customer would likely be able to procure on their own. 
 We operate fully redundant data centers on both U.S. coasts, each of which has backup power supply, HVAC and internet connectivity. We are able to provide a level of 24/7/365 fault-tolerant hardware and network uptime that few of our customers could afford to procure or maintain on their own. In addition, we augment our own private cloud-based infrastructure with a secure public cloud offering through a collaboration with Amazon Web Services.

Gunshot Detection Software 
 The heart of our gunshot detection solutions is our sophisticated and highly-specialized software. Our software analyzes audio signals for potential gunshots first in our intelligent sensors. Our sensor filters out ambient background noise, such as traffic or wind, and looks for impulsive sounds characteristic of gunfire. If the sensor detects such an impulse, it extracts pulse features of the soundwave, such as sharpness, strength, duration, rise time and decay time. Then, the sensor sends these features to our cloud servers as part of a data packet that includes the location coordinates of the reporting sensor and the precise time-of-arrival and angle-of-arrival of the sound. 
 When the data reaches our cloud servers, our software assesses whether three or more of our outdoor sensors detected the same sound impulse and, if so, multilaterates the location coordinates of the sound source based on the time of arrival and the angle of arrival of the sound. The software then verifies that the data is mathematically consistent with the sound having originated at a single location. The accuracy of the coordinates derived from our proprietary software is significantly improved when more than three sensors participate, as is typically the case. We deploy our sensor arrays such that, on average, eight sensors participate in the detection of a gunshot. 
 After the software determines the location of the sound source, the machine classifier algorithms analyze the pulse features to determine if the sound is likely to be gunfire. Our algorithms consider pulse features, the distance from the sound source, pattern matching and other heuristic methods to evaluate and classify the sound. The machine classifier is periodically trained and validated against a large database of known gunfire and other community sounds that are impulsive in nature. We continue to add new data to our machine learning database from the incidents reviewed by our acoustic experts in our IRC process. Classification continuously improves as the machine classifiers are re-trained using the expanded data set. 
 Once an incident is classified as likely gunfire, it is sent to the acoustic experts in our IRC for additional analysis and confirmation. Along with confirming an incident is gunfire, our acoustic experts also annotate the alerts with additional information that may be helpful to first responders, such as whether there are multiple shooters or if a high-capacity or fully automatic weapon is being used. Incident notifications are sent when the incident is confirmed as gunfire by one of our acoustic experts. Alerts are delivered by SMS text and push notifications and also through our mobile applications. The time from outdoor trigger-pull to a notification being sent to our customers is typically 45 seconds or less. 
 ShotSpotter Missions combines historical crime data ingested through agency Computer-Aided Dispatch (“CAD”) and Record Management System (“RMS”) feeds along with temporal, location and event-based inputs to create crime forecasts. The system ingests multiple years’ worth of agency data and is “trained” using machine learning to determine correlations across variables. The models are then tested against recent crime data to calibrate forecast accuracy. 
 The ShotSpotter Missions system is flexible enabling agencies to select which crime types to forecast and weight them based on police and community priorities. Mission duration and suggested tactics are configured with police input. Upon deployment, new missions are created for every patrol shift and beat using colored boxes overlayed on a map to indicate discrete areas of high risk for particular crime types. These mission areas enable focused, directed and visible patrol presence to deter crime. 
 Intelligent Sensors 
 Our rugged gunshot detection sensor is an intelligent, internet-enabled device that is specially built to ignore ambient noise and respond to impulsive sounds, accurately time-stamping their arrival times. Advanced digital signal processing algorithms filter out background sounds such as traffic, and extract pulse features from the audio signal that, along with the time and angle of arrival of the sound, are sent to our servers where algorithms compute the location of the sound source. 
 The sensors do not have the ability to live stream audio. Typically, sounds, noises or voices captured on the secure sensors are cached temporarily but are written over and permanently deleted within 48-72 hours. When a sensor is triggered by an impulsive sound, it creates a potential gunshot “incident” that contains a recording including no more than two seconds before the incident and four seconds after the incident.  This audio snippet is preserved indefinitely for potential evidentiary use.

Our sensors are designed and tested against international standards for installation in unprotected outdoor environments. Special consideration is given to minimize the sound of wind, rain and hail, which could otherwise limit the range of detection and produce false results. Environmental condition tests performed on the sensors include temperature cycling, temperature soak, shock, vibration, salt fog and moisture ingress protection. 
 We typically design and deploy arrays of 20 to 30 sensors per square mile taking into consideration the unique acoustic environment in which we are deploying. The cumulative experience of deploying in various cities with different acoustic properties has provided a distinct advantage in tailoring our sensor arrays to perform at high levels. We have full telemetry to each sensor that provides detailed heartbeat data to our system to monitor each sensor’s health and availability. Sensor firmware is maintained with over-the-air updates. Because we purposely over-deploy our sensor arrays, multiple sensors can be offline at any given time without affecting the overall performance of the system. 
 Incident Review Center 
 Our IRC operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. When a loud impulsive sound triggers enough of our outdoor sensors that an incident is detected and located, audio from the incident is sent to our IRC via secure, high-speed network connections for real-time confirmation. Within seconds of an incident, one of our acoustic experts analyzes audio data and recordings of the potential gunfire. When gunfire is confirmed, our IRC team sends an alert directly to emergency dispatch centers and field personnel through any computer or mobile device with access to the Internet. This process typically takes less than 45 seconds from the time of the gunshot. Alerts include: 

• | the precise location of gunfire, including both latitude/longitude and street address;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the number and exact time of shots fired;
--+------------------------------------------


• | the number of shooters; and
--+----------------------------


• | if detectable, the use of fully automatic or high-capacity weapons.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our IRC operates primarily out of our principal facilities in Newark, California and receives audio from incidents detected by our outdoor sensors regardless of where such incidents occur. Although our IRC currently operates at a single location, our trained personnel can perform IRC functions from any location that has a high-speed internet connection.

Gunshot Detection Alerts 
 Our alerts are delivered in the following forms:
 ShotSpotter Dispatch 
 Our IRC sends real-time notifications of outdoor gunfire incidents to the ShotSpotter Dispatch application, which is the user interface designed for emergency dispatch centers. In addition, alerts can also be sent directly to field personnel using the ShotSpotter Respond application installed on computers in police cars. 
 

Through the ShotSpotter applications, the alert provides the type of gunfire (single-round or multiple-round), a unique identification number (Flex ID number), a date and time of the muzzle blast (trigger time), nearest address to the precise latitude and longitude of the gunfire, number of shots and police district and beat identification. The alert also includes an audio clip of the incident. 
 One of our acoustic experts may add other contextual information related to the incident such as the possibility of multiple shooters, high-capacity or fully automatic weapons, and the shooter’s location relative to a building (for example, in the front or back yard or in the street). An audit trail of the time the alert was published to and acknowledged by our customer is also contained in the report. Any notes added by 911 dispatchers are time- and date-stamped and indicate the operator’s identification. 
 ShotSpotter Respond
 We also offer a robust mobile application, for customers using iPhone and Android devices. This application allows field personnel to directly receive immediate alerts of outdoor gunshots and related critical information. The alert provides the type of gunfire (single-round or multiple-round), a unique identification number (Flex ID number), 
 11

a date and time of the muzzle blast (trigger time), nearest address to the location of the gunfire, number of shots and police district and beat identification. The alert also includes an audio clip of the incident.

Real-time alert data with respect to gunshots can also be delivered to customers through email or SMS text messages. 
 Other Applications and Services
 Investigator Portal 
 All historical incident data in our database can be viewed, searched, sorted, and filtered using the Investigator Portal. The Investigator Portal can create reports for single incidents or groups of incidents. Filter settings may be used to select incidents grouped into a single report. Any predefined reports may be viewed, printed, or the raw data exported for use in third-party applications. The Investigator Portal also includes the ability to save audio clips to any recordable media. 
Forensic Reports and Certified Expert Witness Services 
 Our gunshot data is also useful for detailed forensic analysis that helps reveal and clarify what actually occurred during a gunfire incident, including the identification of certain weapon types, the number and specific time of each individual round fired, the number of shooters involved and the changes in location and direction of shooters in motion. Because our solutions provide an exact time, location and audio recording of a gunshot, we are able to provide authorities with critical evidence for investigations and prosecutions. 
 

As part of our solution, we offer Detailed Forensic Reports (“DFRs”). These provide law enforcement personnel and prosecutors with comprehensive, court-admissible analysis of a shooting incident, including the gunfire audio. We also offer expert witness testimony to introduce the forensic analysis of the DFRs at trial and to provide technical expertise regarding our technology. Our forensic evidence has been admitted in over 100 criminal prosecutions throughout the United States. Our technology and the forensic results achieved from it have been found to be admissible in numerous states, adhering to either the Frye or Daubert expert testimony standard, including Minnesota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, California, Missouri, New York, Colorado, Indiana and New Jersey.

ShotSpotter Missions
 ShotSpotter Missions uses artificial intelligence-driven analysis to help strategically plan patrol missions and tactics for maximum crime deterrence. The software-based tool provides: 
  
• | crime forecasting and mission planning enabling more precise deployment of patrol resources;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | dosage and tactic guidance by crime type to avoid oversaturation; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | report on mission activity and tactics for command staff.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 The system combines historical crime data ingested through agency CAD and RMS feeds along with temporal, location and event-based inputs to create crime forecasts. The system ingests multiple years’ worth of agency data and is “trained” using machine learning to determine correlations across variables. The models are then tested against recent crime data to calibrate forecast accuracy. 
 The Missions system is flexible enabling agencies to select which crime types to forecast and weight them based on police and community priorities. Mission duration and suggested tactics are configured with police input. Upon deployment, new missions are created for every patrol shift and beat using colored boxes overlayed on a map to indicate discrete areas of high risk for particular crime types. These mission areas enable focused, directed and visible patrol presence to deter crime. 
 

Deployment and Customer Success 
 When we deploy new ShotSpotter Flex, ShotSpotter SiteSecure and ShotSpotter SecureCampus solutions, we install our outdoor sensors in a specified coverage area according to our contract with the customer. As an initial step, we perform site surveys of the coverage area to design a sensor array, which typically consist of 20 to 30 sensors per square mile. We typically install sensors on the highest buildings in the area, but we may also use existing infrastructure assets such as light poles. Once permission for installation is obtained, we typically engage local electricians to install the sensors and perform required maintenance.

Given the specialized nature of our market, a key component of our strategy is to maintain our passionate focus on customer success. We pride ourselves on our execution in customer on-boarding as well as ongoing consulting and customer support, all of which is critical to ensure not only high customer retention rates but new customer acquisitions. We implement our customer success initiative early in the sales process in order to ensure that we are aligned with the customer’s objectives and can positively impact their defined outcomes. For example, during deployment, our customer success team, consisting of experienced law enforcement professionals, provides on-site training to the customer’s officers, dispatchers and investigators, including training on how to use the solution and best practices for optimal results. We apply consultative best practices and policy development at the command staff level as well as tactical training for field patrol officers. All of our efforts are focused on driving positive measurable outcomes on gun violence reduction and prevention. 
 Our IRC and customer service organizations provide continuous outdoor incident classification and technical support 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The nature of our outdoor incident classification process provides ongoing and significant touchpoints with our customers through our published alerts. We also interact with our customers through email, chat and telephone inquiries, and monitor our customers’ local news feeds and radio dispatch traffic in order to remain aware of their violence prevention activities. 
 Our customer success team is responsible for conducting periodic in-person account reviews that detail all aspects of the services provided, including outcomes generated and areas for future improvement. We believe that these account reviews, along with our formalized on-boarding customer success program, are largely responsible for our high net promoter score (“NPS”). We obtain our NPS by conducting surveys to measure customer loyalty and satisfaction. We believe a high NPS indicates a substantial competitive advantage in facilitating customer acquisition and retention and increases customer lifetime value. 
 Customers 
 We generate annual subscription revenues from the deployment of our public safety solution on a per-square-mile basis. As of December 31, 2018, we had coverage areas under contract of approximately 670 square miles in the aggregate, of which 648 miles have gone live, which included 100 cities and 10 campuses and other sites across the United States and South Africa, including three of the ten largest cities in the United States. Since transitioning our public safety business to the ShotSpotter Flex model in 2011, we have added over 60 new ShotSpotter Flex customers, but only six such customers have terminated service, two of which were terminated due to hurricane damage in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our two largest customers, City of Chicago and City of New York accounted for 22% and 15% of our revenue, respectively. The City of New York accounted for 18% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, and accounted for 12% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Puerto Rico Housing Administration accounted for 12% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.Sales 
 We sell our solutions through our direct sales teams. Our sales teams focus on both new customer acquisition, customer renewal and coverage expansion. Our public safety solution sales team identifies communities with the opportunity to benefit from our solutions, communicates with key stakeholders, navigates the challenges associated with our customers’ complex funding and sales cycles, and establishes a foundation for a successful customer relationship. In addition, our sales team works with customers to identify and procure funds from alternate sources, including state and federal government grants. Our security solutions sales team focuses primarily on college and university campuses, typically with the head of campus security, but also by engaging with boards of regents, budget office personnel and other campus stakeholders. We intend to continue to invest in building a global sales organization as we further penetrate the market for ShotSpotter Flex and expand the customer base for our security solutions. 
 At times, we may sell our solutions through channel partners as part of “Smart Cities” initiatives. To help integrate our solutions with other services in this space and to take advantage of current and emerging technologies, we seek to enter into alliances with leading companies focused on such initiatives. For example, in early 2017 we entered into a partnership with GE Current to integrate our outdoor sensors, along with other technologies, into street lighting systems that help cities collect data and improve their operations. In 2018, we entered into an agreement with Verizon to bring the ShotSpotter solution to cities by leveraging Verizon's Light Sensory Network, an IoT platform deployed on street lights. By integrating our solutions with GE Current’s and Verizon’s systems, we believe we will expand our coverage. In August of 2018, we entered into an agreement with Verizon, where they may sell our Flex solutions as a reseller, in addition to the solution bundled with their Light Sensory Network.

Marketing 
 We focus our marketing efforts on the strength of our ShotSpotter brand and the unique features and benefits of our solutions. 
 Our approach and capabilities in marketing improved significantly in 2018 as we brought on veteran leadership and invested resources to expand the team, acquired new automation tools and developed and launched targeted programs across multiple stakeholder groups that can influence a sale. The focus of the team is two-fold: to drive new, qualified leads into the pipeline enabling the sales team to focus on closing deals, and to accelerate existing deals reducing time to revenue. 
 We have developed several innovative programs that target influencers including initiatives to encourage healthcare systems to advocate for and/or fund ShotSpotter deployments in their cities as well as a program to activate residents of ShotSpotter prospect cities to advocate to city officials for programs and technologies that reduce gun violence including ShotSpotter. 
 We continue to invest in creating a presence at key events and conferences throughout the year where we can personally engage with customers, prospects and influencers such as mayors, city managers, and trauma surgeons. The face-to-face interactions are invaluable for introducing our value proposition, establishing relationships and building trust. 
 We continue to benefit from significant television, print and online press that is generated at little to no cost. Members of the media have access to a self-serve, comprehensive media kit to easily insert video and photos that depict the service and its benefits in a compelling fashion to enhance broadcast TV segments and print/online articles. We were mentioned in over 8,500 articles in 2018 - the majority of which were organically generated. In addition, we were mentioned in numerous broadcast TV and radio segments. The free exposure creates awareness for our system and lends credibility to our market leadership position. 
 Research and Development 
 We focus our research and development efforts on enhancing our advanced signal processing and classification algorithms, updating our sensor hardware technology, reducing manufacturing costs, developing mobile, web and desktop applications, evolving our cloud-deployed back-end infrastructure and integration with “smart cities” initiatives. ShotSpotter Missions crime forecasting uses machine learning and has led to additional investment in data science resources. As of December 31, 2018, we had 18 employees in our research and development organization. In addition, we engage in research and development activities with manufacturing partners and outsource certain activities to engineering firms to further supplement our internal team. Our research and development team is increasingly focused on exploring the use of our data sets to conduct cognitive analysis and artificial intelligence integration.
Competition 
 The markets for public safety and security solutions are highly fragmented and evolving. Whether installed in local communities, on critical infrastructure or on a campus, for a gunfire detection system to be effective, the protection zone must be comprehensive. We believe our gunshot detection solutions represent the most effective public safety and security solutions on the market. 
 We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including: 
  
• | product functionality, including the ability to cover broad outdoor geographic spaces;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | solution performance, including the rapid capture of multiple acoustic incidents and accuracy;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ease of implementation, use and maintenance;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | total cost of ownership; and
--+-----------------------------


• | customer support and customer success initiatives.

ShotSpotter Flex Solution Competitors 
 Our ShotSpotter Flex solution is unique because it provides scalable wide area gunshot detection over large and geographically diverse areas, provides immediate and precise data on gunfire, helps communities define the scope of illegal gunfire, and provides cities with detailed forensic data for investigation, prosecution and analysis. While we are not aware of any direct competitors offering wide-area solutions comparable to ShotSpotter Flex, we believe the primary competitors in the broader gunfire detection space are Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd., Raytheon Company, V5 Systems, Safety Dynamics, Inc., EAGL Technology, Shooter Detection Systems and Thales Group. 
 Most of these other outdoor solutions on the market offer limited scope point protection, proximity sensors, or “counter-sniper systems.” These systems are designed primarily for covering small areas, or for defined military or SWAT team applications, where the target is known in advance and it is possible to put a sensor directionally toward the target. However, urban areas and critical infrastructure require a wider system of protection that can cover a large area. 
 Although there are not direct competitors for our ShotSpotter Flex solution that are of concern, we do compete with other possible uses of the limited funding available to our ShotSpotter Flex customers. Because law enforcement agencies or government entities have limited funds, they may have to choose among resources or solutions that help them to meet their overall mission. Accordingly, we compete not only with our customers’ internal budget decisions, but with numerous companies vying for these limited funds, including Everbridge, Inc. and Axon Enterprises, Inc., among others. We believe that in areas with significant levels of gun activity, ShotSpotter Flex is uniquely positioned to assist customers in interrupting, detecting and preventing gun violence. 
 Security Solutions Competitors 
 Our security solutions business operates in a highly competitive environment. In addition to other gunfire detection companies, we may face competition from companies offering alternative security technologies, such as video surveillance, access control, alarm and lighting systems. The direct competitors for security solutions include the Guardian system by Shooter Detection Systems LLC, SENTRI by Safety Dynamics Inc., V5 Systems, FireFly by EAGL, and AmberBox, Inc. We believe none of our security solutions competitors is able to offer the comprehensive outdoor coverage we offer. 
ShotSpotter Missions Solution Competitors 
 ShotSpotter Missions operates in a developing and potentially competitive environment. In addition to control management and data analytics customers companies, we may face competition from companies offering alternative solutions as well as solutions developed internally by our customers. The direct competitors to our Missions solution include PredPol, Inc., CivicScape, LLC and may include other CAD/RMS providers and other third-party solutions providers, such as Genentech, Inc., CentralSquare Technologies and Motorola Solutions, Inc.
Intellectual Property 
 Our future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and contractual protections in the United States and other jurisdictions. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 32 issued patents, 31 in the United States and one in Israel, as well as patent applications pending for examination in the United States, Europe, Brazil and Mexico. 
 The issued patents expire on various dates from 2022 to 2034. We also license one patent from a third party, which expires in 2023. 
 We also license software from third parties for integration into our offerings, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.

Facilities 
 Our principal facilities consist of office space for our corporate headquarters in Newark, California, where we occupy approximately 12,020 square feet of space under a lease that expires in October 2021. 
 We lease our facilities and do not own any real property. We may procure additional space as we add employees and expand geographically. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future and that should it be needed, suitable additional space will be available to accommodate expansion of our operations. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 96 full-time and five part-time employees, of which 17 were in sales and marketing, 12 were in general and administrative functions, 18 in research and development and 54 in operations, customer support and customer success. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
