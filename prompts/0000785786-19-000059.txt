ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together "Plexus," the "Company," or "we") participate in the Electronic Manufacturing Services ("EMS") industry. We partner with our customers to create the products that build a better world. Since 1979, Plexus has been partnering with companies to transform concepts into branded products and deliver them to the market. From idea to aftermarket and everything in between, Plexus is a global leader in providing support for all the facets of the product realization process - Design and Development, Supply Chain Solutions, New Product Introduction, Manufacturing, and Aftermarket Services. Plexus delivers comprehensive end-to-end solutions in the Americas ("AMER"), Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia-Pacific ("APAC") regions for our customers.
We specialize in working in industries with highly complex products and demanding regulatory environments. Plexus has partnerships with approximately 140 customers in the Healthcare/Life Sciences, Industrial/Commercial, Aerospace/Defense and Communications market sectors. We leverage our expertise to understand the unique needs of our customers' markets and have aligned our processes to provide flexibility, create efficiency and deliver superior quality. Our customers have stringent quality, reliability and regulatory requirements, requiring exceptional production and supply chain agility. Their products require complex configuration management, direct order fulfillment (to end customers), global logistics management and aftermarket services. In order to service the complexities that our customers' products demand, we utilize our full suite of solution offerings to support our customers’ products from concept to end of life.
Plexus is passionate about being a global leader at serving markets consisting of highly complex customer programs and demanding regulatory environments. Our customers look to us to fulfill programs characterized by unique flexibility, technology, quality and regulatory requirements. To deliver on our strategy, we align our operations, processes, workforce and financial metrics to create:

• | A high performance, accountable organization with a talented workforce that is deeply passionate about driving growth through customer service excellence;


• | Strategic growth by using customer driven, sector based go-to-market strategies; and


• | Execution driven by a collaborative, customer-centric culture that continuously evaluates and optimizes our business processes to strive to create shareholder value.

We operate flexible manufacturing facilities and design our processes to accommodate customers with multiple product lines and configurations. One or more uniquely configured "focus factories," supported by tailored supply chain and logistics solutions, are designed to meet the flexibility and responsiveness needed to support customer fulfillment requirements.
We accomplish our go-to-market strategy through the four market sectors we serve. Each sector has a market sector vice president, as well as business development and customer management leaders who together oversee and provide leadership to teams that include business development directors, customer directors or managers, supply chain, engineering and manufacturing subject matter experts, and market sector analysts. These teams maintain expertise related to each market sector and execute sector strategies aligned to that market’s unique quality and regulatory requirements. 
Our market sector teams help define Plexus' strategy for growth with a particular emphasis on expanding the value-added solutions we offer customers. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on targeting new customers and expanding business with existing customers. We believe our ability to provide a full range of product realization services gives us a business advantage.
Our financial model aligns with our business strategy. Our primary focus is to earn a return on invested capital ("ROIC") 500 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), which we refer to as "Economic Return." We review our internal calculation of WACC annually; for fiscal 2019, our WACC was 9.0%. We believe economic profit is a fundamental driver of shareholder value. Plexus measures economic profit by taking the difference between ROIC and WACC and multiplying it by invested capital. By exercising discipline to generate a ROIC in excess of our WACC, with focus on economic profit, our goal is to ensure that we create value for our shareholders. For more information regarding ROIC and Economic Return, which are non-GAAP financial measures, refer to "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Results of Operations - Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and Economic Return" in Part II, Item 7. For a reconciliation of ROIC and Economic Return to our financial statements that were prepared using accounting principles 
generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP"), see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
Relative to our competition, overriding factors such as lower manufacturing volumes, flexibility and fulfillment requirements, and complex regulatory requirements typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs for us. The cost variance from our competitors is especially evident relative to those that provide EMS services for high-volume, less complex products, with less stringent requirements (e.g., consumer electronics).
Plexus serves a diverse customer landscape that includes industry-leading, branded product companies, along with other technology pioneering start-ups and emerging companies that may or may not maintain manufacturing capabilities. In addition to prime technology advancements, key government and policy trends impact our business, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s ("FDA") approval of new medical devices, defense procurement practices, and other government and regulatory processes. Plexus may benefit from increasing outsourcing trends.
We provide most of our optimized solutions on a turnkey basis, and we typically procure all materials required for product assembly. We provide select services on a consignment basis, meaning the customer supplies the necessary materials and Plexus provides the labor and other services required for product assembly. In addition to manufacturing, turnkey service requires material procurement and warehousing and involves greater resource investments than consignment services. Other than certain test equipment, manufacturing equipment, and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.
Established in 1979 as a Wisconsin corporation, we have over 19,000 employees, including over 3,300 engineers and technologists dedicated to product development and design, test equipment development and design, and manufacturing process development and control, all of whom operate from 26 active facilities, totaling approximately 4.0 million square feet. Plexus' facilities are strategically located to support the global supply chain, engineering, manufacturing, and aftermarket service needs of customers in our targeted market sectors.
Plexus maintains a website at www.plexus.com. As soon as is reasonably practical, after we electronically file or furnish all reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we provide online copies of such reports, free of charge. These reports include: Proxy Statements, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Specialized Disclosure Reports on Form SD, and amendments to those reports. These reports are also accessible at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics is also posted on our website. You may access these SEC reports and the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics by following the links under "Investors" at our website. 
Solutions
With integrated Design and Development, Supply Chain Solutions, New Product Introduction, Manufacturing and Aftermarket Services, we proactively tackle tough challenges throughout the product lifecycle. It is how our teams strive to create innovative and efficient paths to get products to market.

Our supply chain experts engage in all of Plexus’ integrated solutions, working closely with our engineers to identify opportunities for supply chain optimization early in the design stage. At Plexus, we take pride in managing the full supply chain to minimize cost, mitigate risk and provide a flexible, scalable solution for our customers. 
New Product Introduction - When introducing a new product, customers need to move quickly. Plexus offers a dedicated team focused on decreasing time to market with a full suite of integrated new product introduction services. Through early integration and collaboration, customers can take advantage of Plexus’ capabilities, such as design for excellence (DFX), specialized design of test solutions and rapid prototyping, while the project is advanced by a dedicated Plexus transition management team. 
Manufacturing - Our approach to manufacturing focuses on innovation, continuous improvement and superior quality and delivery. With a global footprint and scalable operations, we aim to tailor our manufacturing environment to meet each 
customer’s needs worldwide. As we strive for zero defects, we endeavor to empower all employees with the knowledge that exceptional quality begins with each individual member of our team. As a result, we believe Plexus is positioned to support the complex technology and regulatory needs of the industries we serve and to provide customers with innovative and dependable manufacturing services. 
Aftermarket Services - From product deployment all the way through a product’s end of life, Plexus offers a full range of aftermarket services. We help our customers manage and extend the lifecycle of their products through an optimized level of service. With services such as depot repair, service parts logistics management, order management, distribution and warehousing, and recycling, we are committed to protecting the success of each customer's product.
Regulatory Requirements
All Plexus manufacturing and engineering facilities are certified to a baseline Quality Management System standard per ISO9001:2015. We have capabilities to assemble finished medical devices meeting FDA Quality Systems Regulation requirements and similar regulatory requirements in other countries. 
We have additional certifications and/or registrations held by certain facilities in the following regions:

Customers and Market Sectors Served
Our customers range from large multinational companies to smaller emerging technology companies. During fiscal 2019, we served approximately 140 customers. We offer advanced design and production capabilities, allowing our customers to concentrate on their core competencies. Plexus helps accelerate our customers' time to market, reduce their investment in engineering and manufacturing capacity, and optimize total product cost.
General Electric Company ("GE") accounted for 12.4%, 12.3% and 12.2% of our net sales during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our net sales in any of the last three fiscal years. 
Net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements, terminations, delays, modifications and transitions. We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Customers' forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end-market demand and other factors, including global economic conditions. Any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts, or other customers, could materially affect our results of operations. The loss of any major customer could have a significant negative impact on our financial results. In addition, as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors, we will become increasingly dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector. Many of our large customers contract with us through multiple independent divisions, subsidiaries, 
production facilities or locations. We believe that in most cases our sales to any one such division, subsidiary, facility or location are independent of sales to others.
The distribution of our net sales by market sectors for the indicated fiscal years is shown in the following table:

Industry | 2019 | 2018 | 2017
Healthcare/Life Sciences | 38% | 36% | 34% 
Industrial/Commercial | 31% | 32% | 31% 
Aerospace/Defense | 19% | 16% | 16% 
Communications | 12% | 16% | 19% 
Total net sales | 100% | 100% | 100%

Although our current business development focus is based on our targeted market sectors, we evaluate our financial performance and allocate our resources geographically (see Note 11 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our reportable segments). Plexus offers a uniform array of services for customers in each market sector and, aside from the specific go-to-market teams, we do not dedicate operational equipment, personnel, facilities or other resources to particular market sectors, nor internally track our costs and resources per market sector.
Materials and Suppliers
We typically purchase raw materials, including PCBs and electronic components, from manufacturers and distributors. Under certain circumstances, we will purchase components from brokers, customers, or competitors. The key electronic components we purchase include: specialized components, semiconductors, interconnect products, electronic subassemblies (including memory modules, power supply modules and cable and wire harnesses), inductors, resistors, and capacitors.
We also purchase non-electronic, typically custom engineered, components used in manufacturing and higher-level assembly. These components include molded/formed plastics, sheet metal fabrications, aluminum extrusions, robotics, motors, vision sensors, motion/actuation, fluidics, displays, die castings and various other hardware and fastener components. These components are sourced from both Plexus preferred suppliers and customer directed suppliers. Components range from standard to highly customized and vary widely in terms of market availability and price.
Component shortages and subsequent allocations by our suppliers are an inherent risk to the electronics industry, and have particularly been an issue for us and the industry from time to time. We discuss the causes of these shortages more fully in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A herein. We actively manage our business to minimize our exposure to material and component shortages.
Plexus' global supply chain management organization attempts to create strong supplier alliances and ensure a steady flow of components and products at competitive prices. We strive to achieve these goals through advanced supply chain solutions we develop in partnership with our customers, risk management tools and global expediting processes. Plexus can often influence the selection of new product components when engaged to provide design and development solutions. 
Competition
Plexus operates in a highly competitive market, with a goal to be best-in-class at meeting the unique needs of our customers. With integrated Design and Development, Supply Chain Solutions, New Product Introduction, Manufacturing and Aftermarket Services, we proactively tackle tough challenges throughout the product lifecycle. A number of competitors may provide electronics manufacturing and engineering services similar to Plexus. Others may be more established in certain industry sectors, or have greater financial, manufacturing, or marketing resources. Smaller competitors compete mainly in specific sectors and within limited geographic areas. Plexus also competes with in-house capabilities of current and potential customers. Plexus maintains awareness and knowledge of our competitors' capabilities in order to remain highly competitive within our target markets.
Intellectual Property
We own various service marks that we use in our business, which are registered in the trademark offices of the United States and other countries. Although we own certain patents, they are not currently material to our business. We do not have any material copyrights.
Information Technology
Our core solutions for manufacturing facilities include a single-instance Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system, as well as Product Data Management and Advanced Planning and Scheduling systems, along with consistent solutions for warehouse management and shop floor execution, that support our global operations. This consistency augments our other management information systems, allowing us to standardize our ability to translate data from multiple production facilities into operational and financial information required by the business. The related software licenses are of a general commercial character on terms customary for these types of agreements. Enhancing cybersecurity continues to be a priority and we have several initiatives underway that are intended to further advance our security posture.
Environmental Compliance
We are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to air emission standards and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal, state, and foreign environmental laws and do not anticipate any significant expenditures in maintaining our compliance; however, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Social Responsibility
Plexus is committed to social responsibility throughout our global business operations. As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA"), we have taken an active role in improving not only our own practices, but influencing and holding others accountable throughout our supply chain to improve their focus on important social principles. We consider a variety of standards for socially responsible practices, including, but not limited to, local and federal legal requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate, the International Organization for Standardization’s "Guidance for Social Responsibility" (ISO 26000) and standards established by the RBA. Our commitment to social responsibility focuses on four key areas: (1) responsible employer, (2) community steward, (3) global citizen and (4) industry steward. 
Responsible Employer - We advocate for diversity, combat human trafficking activities, encourage and provide employee development opportunities, strive to ensure safe and healthy working conditions, promote an appropriate work/life balance for our employees, encourage wellness initiatives and reinforce responsible values in our culture.
Community Steward - We promote and financially contribute to programs involving science and technology in education and causes that make a meaningful impact to the communities in which we operate. We encourage our employees' involvement in community charitable organizations, as well as volunteerism, and we partner with community organizations to promote local business.
Global Citizen - We actively work to reduce waste, water use and greenhouse gas emissions from our operations, work with suppliers to develop similar programs and partner with customers to help design more efficient and environmentally friendly products. 
Industry Steward - We take an active role in industry coalitions focused on improving working conditions around the world, the environment and ethical business practices. We train our supply chain on important social initiatives, such as detecting and preventing forced labor, and we collaborate with customers to advance sustainability initiatives.
Employees
We make a considerable effort, and invest at all levels of the organization, to maintain a highly qualified and engaged work force. We offer enhanced career opportunities to many of our employees. Our human resources department identifies career objectives and monitors specific skill development opportunities for employees with potential for advancement. We have a policy of involvement and consultation with employees at every facility and strive for continuous improvement at all levels.
We employ over 19,000 employees. Given the quick response times required by our customers, we seek to maintain flexibility to scale our operations as necessary to maximize efficiency. To do so we use skilled temporary labor in addition to our full-time employees. Approximately 250 and 1,500 of our employees in the United Kingdom and Mexico, respectively, are covered by union agreements. These union agreements are typically renewed at the beginning of each year, although in a few cases these agreements may last two or more years. Our employees in China, Germany, Malaysia, Romania and the United States are not covered by union agreements. We have no history of labor disputes at any of our facilities, and we believe that our employee relationships are generally positive and stable.
