ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Mexco Energy Corporation, a Colorado corporation, is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties located in the United States. Incorporated in April 1972 under the name Miller Oil Company, the Company changed its name to Mexco Energy Corporation effective April 30, 1980. At that time, the shareholders of the Company also approved amendments to the Articles of Incorporation resulting in a one-for-fifty reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock.
 
Our total estimated proved reserves at March 31, 2019 were approximately 1.937 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBOE”) of which 54% was oil and natural gas liquids and 46% was natural gas, and our estimated present value of proved reserves was approximately $22 million based on estimated future net revenues excluding taxes discounted at 10% per annum, pricing and other assumptions set forth in “Item 2 – Properties” below. During fiscal 2019, we added proved reserves of 275 thousand BOE (“MBOE”) through extensions and discoveries and subtracted 365 MBOE through downward revisions of previous estimates. Such downward revisions are primarily the result of the restructuring of our plans for development of our operated property in Ector County, Texas due to market conditions partially offset by pricing and successful development in the Delaware and Midland Basins.
 
Nicholas C. Taylor beneficially owns approximately 47% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Mr. Taylor is also our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, Mr. Taylor has significant influence in matters voted on by our shareholders, including the election of our Board members. Mr. Taylor participates in all facets of our business and has a significant impact on both our business strategy and daily operations.

Company Profile
 
Since our inception, we have been engaged in acquiring and developing oil and gas properties and the exploration for and production of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) within the United States. We especially seek to acquire proved reserves that fit well with existing operations or in areas where Mexco has established production. Acquisitions preferably will contain most of their value in producing wells, behind pipe reserves and high quality proved undeveloped locations. Competition for the purchase of proved reserves is intense. Sellers often utilize a bid process to sell properties. This process usually intensifies the competition and makes it extremely difficult to acquire reserves without assuming significant price and production risks. We actively search for opportunities to acquire proved oil and gas properties. However, because the competition is intense, we cannot give any assurance that we will be successful in our efforts during fiscal 2020.
 
While we own oil and gas properties in other states, the majority of our activities are centered in the Permian Basin of West Texas. The Company also owns producing properties and undeveloped acreage in thirteen states. We acquire interests in producing and non-producing oil and gas leases from landowners and leaseholders in areas considered favorable for oil and gas exploration, development and production. In addition, we may acquire oil and gas interests by joining in oil and gas drilling prospects generated by third parties. We may also employ a combination of the above methods of obtaining producing acreage and prospects. In recent years, we have placed primary emphasis on the evaluation and purchase of producing oil and gas properties, both working and royalty interests, and prospects that could have a potentially meaningful impact on our reserves. Most of the Company’s oil and gas interests are operated by others, however the Company operates several properties in which it owns an interest.
 
From 1983 to 2019, Mexco Energy Corporation made approximately 80 acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties including royalties, overriding royalties, minerals and working interests both operated and non-operated plus the following most significant and recent acquisitions:
 

1993-2010 | Tabbs Bay Oil Company and Thompson Brothers Lumber Company, respectively dissolved in 1957 and 1947. Purchase covering thousands of acres located respectively in 19 counties of Texas, 3 parishes of Louisiana and one county in Arkansas and 8 counties of Texas, respectively consisting of various mineral, royalty and overriding royalty interests. 
----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1997 | Forman Energy Corporation, purchase price of $1,591,000 consisting of primarily working interests in approximately 634 wells located in 12 states. 
2010 | Southwest Texas Disposal Corporation, purchase price $478,000 consisting of royalty interests in over 300 wells located in 60 counties and parishes of 6 states. 
2012 | TBO Oil and Gas, LLC, purchase price of $1,150,000 consisting of working interests in approximately 280 wells located in 16 counties of 3 states. 
2014 | Royalty interests, purchase price of $200,000 covering 43 wells in 12 counties of eight states, primarily in Texas. 

 
Royalty interests, purchase price $580,000 covering 580 wells in 87 counties of eight states. Approximately 90% of the net revenue from these royalties is produced by 157 wells located in the Barnett Shale of the Fort Worth Basin of Texas. Also included are interests in 423 wells in 8 states.
 
Non-Operated working interests, purchase price $525,000 for 12.5% (approximately 10% net revenue interest). The purchase included eight wells producing oil on 20-acre spacing at approximately 3,600 foot depth on 190 acres in Pecos County, TX.
 
Royalty and mineral interests, purchase price $1,000,000 covering approximately 1,800 wells in 27 counties of Texas. Of these oil and gas reserves, approximately 80% is natural gas and 20% oil.
 
Non-Operated working interests, purchase price $840,000 in 70 Natural gas producing wells located in 5 counties of Oklahoma.

Industry Environment and Outlook
 
The challenging commodity price environment continued in fiscal 2019. Commodity prices improved but continue to be volatile. In light of these challenges facing our industry and in response to the continued challenging environment, our primary business strategies for fiscal 2020 will continue to include: (1) optimizing cash flows through operating efficiencies and cost reductions, (2) divesting of non-core assets, and (3) working to balance capital spending with cash flows to minimize borrowings, reduce debt and maintain ample liquidity.
 
See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion of our fiscal 2019 operating results and potential impact on fiscal 2020 operating results due to commodity price changes.
 
Oil and Gas Operations
 
As of March 31, 2019, oil constituted approximately 54% of our total proved reserves and approximately 72% of our revenues for fiscal 2019. Revenues from oil and gas royalty interests accounted for approximately 27% of our revenues for fiscal 2019.
 
There are two primary areas in which the Company is focused, 1) the Delaware Basin located in the Western portion of the Permian Basin including Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas and 2) the Midland Basin located in the Eastern portion of the Permian Basin including Reagan, Upton, Midland, Martin, Howard and Glasscock Counties, Texas. The Permian Basin in total accounts for 70% of our discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves and 78% of our net revenues.
 
The Delaware Basin properties, encompassing 29,625 gross acres, 294 net acres, 488 gross producing wells and 5 net wells account for approximately 34% of our discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves as of March 31, 2019. Of these discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves, approximately 10% are attributable to proven undeveloped reserves which will be developed through new drilling. For fiscal 2019, these properties accounted for 45% of our gross revenues and 56% of our net revenues.
 
The Midland Basin properties, encompassing 99,183 gross acres, 298 net acres, 1,000 gross producing wells and 3 net wells account for approximately 36% of our discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves as of March 31, 2019. Of these discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves, approximately 29% are attributable to proven undeveloped reserves which will be developed through new drilling. For fiscal 2019, these properties accounted for 20% of our gross revenues and 25% of our net revenues.
 
Gomez Gas Field properties, encompassing 13,058 gross acres, 72 net acres, 27 gross wells and .13 net wells in Pecos County, Texas, account for approximately 10% of our discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves as of March 31, 2019. Of these discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves, approximately 9% are attributable to proven undeveloped reserves which will be developed through new drilling in the horizontal Wolfcamp. For fiscal 2019, these properties accounted for 2% of our gross revenues and 2% of our net revenues. All of these properties, except for one, are royalty interests.
 
Mexco believes its most important properties for future development by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing area are located in Midland, Reagan and Upton Counties, Texas of the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas.
 
For more on these and other operations in this area see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources Commitments”.
 
We own partial interests in approximately 6,100 producing wells all of which are located within the United States in the states of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Wyoming, Kansas, Colorado, Montana, Virginia and North Dakota. We own 100% working interests in and operate 3 producing wells in Ector County, Texas. Additional information concerning these properties and our oil and gas reserves is provided below.

The following table indicates our oil and gas production in each of the last five years:
 

Year | Oil(Bbls) | | Gas (Mcf) 
-----+-----------+--------+--------------
2019 | | 35,359 | | 295,133
2018 | | 34,743 | | 318,774
2017 | | 34,689 | | 356,268

2015 | | 29,557 | | 369,034

Competition and Markets
 
The oil and gas industry is a highly competitive business. Competition for oil and gas reserve acquisitions is significant. We may compete with major oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators, some of which have financial and personnel resources substantially in excess of those available to us. As a result, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Competitive factors include price, contract terms and types and quality of service, including pipeline distribution. The price for oil and gas is widely followed and is generally subject to worldwide market factors. Our ability to acquire and develop additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment in a timely manner.
 
In addition, the oil and gas industry as a whole also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. The price and availability of alternative energy sources could adversely affect our revenue.
 
Market factors affect the quantities of oil and natural gas production and the price we can obtain for the production from our oil and natural gas properties. Such factors include: the extent of domestic production; the level of imports of foreign oil and natural gas; the general level of market demand on a regional, national and worldwide basis; domestic and foreign economic conditions that determine levels of industrial production; political events in foreign oil-producing regions; and variations in governmental regulations including environmental, energy conservation and tax laws or the imposition of new regulatory requirements upon the oil and natural gas industry.
 
The market for our oil, gas and natural gas liquids production depends on factors beyond our control including: domestic and foreign political conditions; the overall level of supply of and demand for oil, gas and natural gas liquids; the price of imports of oil and gas; weather conditions; the price and availability of alternative fuels; the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; and overall economic conditions.
 
Major Customers
 
We made sales that amounted to 10% or more of revenues as follows for the year ended March 31:
 

 | 2019 | | | 2018
--------------+------+----+---+-----
Company A | | 42 | % | | 37 | %

 
Historically, the Company has not experienced significant credit losses on our oil and gas accounts and management is of the opinion that significant credit risk does not exist. Because a ready market exists for oil and gas production, we do not believe the loss of any individual customer would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
General. Activities on the Company properties are subject to existing stringent and complex federal, state and local laws (including case law) and regulations governing health, safety, environmental quality and pollution control. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations, however, may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations; and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of the operations on the Company properties.

Cleanup. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, the operators of the Company properties could be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of property contamination, whether at a drill site or a waste disposal facility, even when the operators did not cause the contamination or their activities were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the actions were taken. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “superfund” law, for example, imposes liability, regardless of fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons for releases into the environment of a “hazardous substance.” Liable persons may include the current or previous owner and operator of a site where a hazardous substance has been disposed and persons who arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance at a site. Under CERCLA and similar statutes, government authorities or private parties may take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment or sue responsible persons for the associated costs. In the course of operations, the working interest owner and/or the operator of the Company properties may have generated and may generate materials that could trigger cleanup liabilities. In addition, the Company properties have produced oil and/or natural gas for many years, and previous operators may have disposed or released hydrocarbons, wastes or hazardous substances at the Company properties. The operator of the Company properties or the working interest owners may be responsible for all or part of the costs to clean up any such contamination. Although the Company is not the operator of such properties, its ownership of the properties could cause it to be responsible for all or part of such costs to the extent CERCLA or any similar statute imposes responsibility on such parties as “owners.”
 
Climate Change. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and certain other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on those findings, the EPA adopted and implemented various regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). Among other things, these covered reductions in GHG emissions from motor vehicles, permits for certain large stationary sources of GHGs, monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified GHG emission sources, including oil and natural gas exploration and production operations, and power plant performance standards that were intended to lead to the creation of additional state GHG control programs. On August 3, 2015, the EPA issued new regulations limiting GHG emissions. Under these regulations, nationwide carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced by approximately 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 with a flexible interim goal. Several industry groups and states challenged the rule. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of this rule pending judicial review. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing the EPA to review the regulations, and on April 4, 2017, the EPA announced that it was reviewing the 2015 carbon dioxide regulations. On April 28, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the litigation pending the current administration’s review. That stay was extended for another 60 days on August 8, 2017. On October 10, 2017, the EPA initiated the formal rulemaking process to repeal the regulations. In August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy rule as a replacement to the 2015 regulations. The EPA’s proposals are subject to public comment and likely legal challenge, and as such, we cannot predict at this time what impact the rulemaking will have on the demand for oil and natural gas production and our operations.
 
Various state governments and regional organizations comprising state governments already have enacted legislation and promulgated rules restricting GHG emissions or promoting the use of renewable energy, and additional such measures are frequently under consideration. Although it is not possible at this time to estimate how potential future requirements addressing GHG emissions would impact operations on the Company properties and revenue, either directly or indirectly, any future federal, state or local laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions could require the operators of our properties to incur new or increased costs to obtain permits, operate and maintain equipment and facilities, install new emission controls, acquire allowances to authorize GHG emissions, pay taxes related to GHG emissions or administer a GHG emissions program. Regulation of GHGs could also result in a reduction in demand for and production of oil and natural gas. Additionally, to the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise, the Company properties may be adversely affected to a greater degree than previously experienced.
 
We did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities for the year ended March 31, 2019. Additionally, as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during fiscal 2020.

Title to Properties
 
The leasehold properties we own are subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. The properties may be subject to burdens such as liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases and other encumbrances, easements and restrictions. We do not believe any of these burdens will materially interfere with the use of these properties.
 
As is customary in the oil and gas industry, only a preliminary title examination is conducted at the time properties believed to be suitable for drilling operations are acquired by us. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, a thorough title examination of the drill site tract is conducted and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects, if any, before proceeding with operations. A thorough title examination has been performed with respect to substantially all leasehold producing properties currently owned by us. We believe the title to our leasehold properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally acceptable in the oil and gas industry subject to such exceptions that, in the opinion of counsel employed in the various areas in which we have conducted exploration activities, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use of such properties.
 
Substantially all of our properties are currently mortgaged under a deed of trust to secure funding through a line of credit.
 
Insurance
 
Our operations are subject to all the risks inherent in the exploration for and development and production of oil and gas including blowouts, fires and other casualties. We maintain insurance coverage customary for operations of a similar nature, but losses could arise from uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.
