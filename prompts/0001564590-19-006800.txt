ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
 We are a medical dermatology company committed to the development and commercialization of novel treatments that provide meaningful benefit for people living with skin diseases. Our lead product candidate, VP-102, is a proprietary drug-device combination of our novel topical solution of cantharidin, a widely recognized, naturally sourced agent to treat topical dermatological conditions, administered through our single-use precision applicator. We are initially developing VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum, or molluscum, a highly contagious and primarily pediatric viral skin disease, and common warts. There are currently no products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, nor is there an established standard of care for either of these diseases, resulting in significant undertreated populations in two of the largest unmet needs in dermatology. In addition to patent protection we are seeking, VP-102 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved product for molluscum and for its active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, to be characterized as a new chemical entity, or NCE, with the five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity associated with that designation. We also believe VP-102 has the potential to qualify for pediatric exclusivity, which would provide for an additional six months of non-patent exclusivity.
 In January 2019, we reported positive top-line results from our Phase 3 CAMP-1 and CAMP-2 pivotal trials with VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum. Both clinical trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of VP-102 compared to placebo. In each trial, we observed that a clinically and statistically significant proportion of subjects treated with VP-102 achieved complete clearance of all treatable molluscum lesions compared to subjects treated with placebo. VP-102 was well-tolerated in both trials, with no serious adverse events reported in VP-102 treated subjects. We plan to submit a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum in the second half of 2019. CAMP-1 was conducted under a special protocol assessment, or SPA, agreement with the FDA. We also have an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of VP-102 for the treatment of common warts (COVE-1). We expect to report top-line results from this trial in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial with VP-102 in external genital warts in the first half of 2019. We also expect to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, for VP-103 in plantar warts in the second half of 2019. We retain exclusive, royalty-free rights to our product candidates across all indications.
 Molluscum is a highly contagious common skin disease caused by a pox virus that produces multiple raised flesh-colored papules, or skin lesions. Molluscum typically presents with 10 to 30 lesions and can present with over 100 lesions. If left untreated, molluscum lesions persist for an average of 13 months, with some cases remaining unresolved for more than two years. The symptoms of molluscum tend to cause considerable anxiety, and parents frequently seek treatment due to its highly contagious nature and physical appearance.
 We estimate approximately 6 million people in the United States have molluscum. Of the 6 million people with molluscum, we estimate that approximately 1 million are diagnosed annually.  Molluscum has a 5% to 11% prevalence rate in children with the greatest incidence in individuals aged one to 14 years old. Accordingly, we estimate this represents a total addressable U.S. market of over $1 billion. We believe that the molluscum prevalence rate in the European Union is at least as high as in the United States.
 Compounded cantharidin has been used for many years by dermatologists to treat molluscum, but it has many limitations. Those limitations include that it is not FDA approved, could have highly variable purity, is not readily available and is often not produced in accordance with good manufacturing practices, or GMP. In addition, the formulation and administration of compounded cantharidin is not standardized and is poorly controlled. Other existing therapies, such as cryotherapy, curettage and laser surgery are also used, but are often painful and may lead to scarring. The potential for scarring and pain makes many of these treatments particularly unsuitable for children. As a result, a significant need exists for a clinically proven and FDA-approved treatment for molluscum.

We have designed VP-102 to address the significant limitations of current compounded cantharidin formulations for the treatment of molluscum, including with respect to safety, purity, efficacy, stability and ease of administration. VP-102 contains the first GMP-controlled formulation of cantharidin with a defined pharmaceutical batch process and an API that is greater than 99% pure. We believe VP-102 addresses the shortcomings associated with current therapies, including pain and discomfort, potential scarring and inconsistent outcomes, and has the potential to be the first FDA-approved product for the treatment of molluscum.
 We are also developing VP-102 for the treatment of common warts. Common warts typically result in two to five lesions. We estimate approximately 22 million people in the United States have common warts and the total addressable U.S. market to be over $1 billion with an estimated 2 million patient visits for common warts each year. In the United States, approximately 50% of the patients who seek treatment for common warts are children, and approximately 25% of common warts patients are treated by pediatricians. We believe that the common wart patient opportunity in the European Union is at least as large as that in the United States. There are currently no FDA-approved products indicated for the treatment of common warts. While common warts can be treated with slow acting, over-the-counter products, the warts tend to be highly refractory and a cause for multiple consultations. We believe that cantharidin’s role as a widely recognized and effective blistering agent for the treatment of skin lesions, coupled with VP-102’s safety and efficacy data in clinical trials for the treatment of molluscum and convenient ease of administration, will allow VP-102 to address many of the shortcomings associated with current therapies. We have an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of VP-102 for the treatment of common warts. We expect to report top-line results from this trial in the second quarter of 2019.
 We also intend to develop our second cantharidin-based product candidate, VP-103, for the treatment of plantar warts. An estimated one-third of the approximately 4.1 million annual patient visits for all types of warts are for the treatment of plantar warts, which are warts located on the bottom of the foot. We expect to conduct IND-enabling studies for this product candidate and to submit an IND to the FDA in the second half of 2019. Pending final formulation and IND clearance, we expect that we will be able to substantially leverage our experience with VP-102 to initiate Phase 2 trials directly in target subjects with plantar warts. We also believe we have the opportunity to expand our proprietary cantharidin formulations for the treatment of additional dermatological conditions with high unmet needs.
 We believe the current medical dermatology landscape provides an opportunity to establish ourselves as a leader in the space. With a more concentrated prescribing base of dermatologists versus other medical specialties, our management’s proven track record and experience in new product launches, and the significant clinical benefits described above, we believe a targeted sales and marketing organization of approximately 50 to 60 sales representatives should enable us to capture market share swiftly in the United States, particularly in our current indications of focus.

 VP-102 for the Treatment of Molluscum
 We are developing VP-102 as a proprietary drug-device combination of a novel 0.7% w/v topical solution of cantharidin administered through our single-use precision applicator. VP-102 has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment for molluscum that we believe will address many of the shortcomings associated with current therapies, including pain and discomfort, scarring and lack of effectiveness.
 We have designed VP-102 to address the significant limitations of current compounded cantharidin formulations for the treatment of molluscum, with respect to safety, purity, efficacy, stability and ease of administration. VP-102 contains the first GMP-controlled formulation of cantharidin with a defined pharmaceutical batch process and an API that is greater than 99% pure.
 Our proprietary single-use applicator allows for precise application to each lesion. Our applicator contains a sealed glass ampule providing long-term room temperature stability without the changes in concentration due to evaporation seen in compounded formulations.
 Clinical Development for Molluscum
 In January 2019, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 3 CAMP-1 and CAMP-2 pivotal trials with VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum. Based on the results from these trials, we plan to submit an NDA to the FDA for VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum in the second half of 2019.

Phase 3 Clinical Trials—CAMP-1 and CAMP-2
 In January 2019, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 3 CAMP-1 and CAMP-2 pivotal trials with VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum. The two trials, identical in design, were randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trials of VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum. CAMP-1 was conducted under a SPA with the FDA. The primary objective of the trials was to evaluate the efficacy of dermal application of VP-102 relative to placebo in subjects 2 years of age and older with molluscum, when treated once every 21 days for up to four applications, by assessing the proportion of subjects achieving complete clearance of all treatable molluscum lesions at Day 84 (Week 12/End of Study visit). Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects with complete clearance at study visits on Days 21 (Week 3), 42 (Week 6) and 63 (Week 9).
 CAMP-1 and CAMP-2 enrolled 528 subjects in total and were conducted at 31 centers in the United States. Results from CAMP-1 and CAMP-2 showed 46% and 54% of subjects treated with VP-102, respectively, achieved complete clearance of all treatable molluscum lesions at Day 84 versus 18% and 13% of subjects in the placebo groups (p<0.0001).  By Day 84, VP-102 treated subjects had a 69% and 83% mean reduction in the number of molluscum lesions, a pre-specified endpoint, in CAMP-1 and CAMP-2, respectively, compared to a 20% increase and a 19% reduction for subjects on placebo.
 Consistent with the results from the Phase 2 clinical trials, VP-102 was also well-tolerated in the Phase 3 trials, with side effects that were primarily mild to moderate. The most frequently reported adverse events were application site reactions that are well-known, reversible side effects related to the mechanism of action of cantharidin, a blistering agent, which is the active ingredient in VP-102. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in CAMP-1 or CAMP-2.
 Based on the results of these trials, we intend to submit an NDA for VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum to the FDA in the second half of 2019.
 Phase 2 Clinical Trial—Innovate Trial
 In September 2018, we announced results from an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial, which we refer to as the Innovate trial. The primary objective of the Innovate trial was to determine any potential systemic exposure from a single 24-hour dermal application of VP-102 when applied to molluscum lesions on pediatric subjects 2 years of age and older. The trial enrolled 33 subjects at a single center into either an exposure group (n=17) or a standard group (n=16) with 32 subjects completing the trial. Following an initial treatment of all subjects with VP-102 and a 21-day evaluation period, treatment continued once every 21 days for three additional applications allowing further evaluation of safety, efficacy and impact on quality of life. 
 Systemic exposure was negligible, as indicated by plasma drug levels that were below the limits of quantification in 65 of 66 samples which were taken either pre-dose or post-dose at timepoints of 2, 6 and 24 hours after treatment with VP-102.  One sample was above the limit of quantification at 2 hours after VP-102 treatment, but systemic exposure was not detectable at the 6-hour and 24-hour timepoints in this subject. At the end of trial visit (Week 12), there was a mean reduction in molluscum lesions of 90% compared to baseline across all subjects enrolled in the Innovate trial and 50% of subjects who completed the trial experienced complete clearance of their treatable molluscum lesions.  VP-102 was well-tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. Phase 2 Clinical Trial—Pilot Trial
 In 2016, we conducted an open-label, Phase 2 clinical trial, which we refer to as the Pilot Trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our proprietary cantharidin formulation and to determine the optimal treatment regimen and estimate power for the pivotal trials. The trial enrolled 30 subjects at a single center and was completed in September 2017. The trial utilized a single-use screw-top vial of our proprietary 0.7% cantharidin formulation, with application via the wooden part of a cotton-tipped swab, which is the method of application historically used with compounded cantharidin. The subjects were divided into two cohorts, with the first cohort instructed to wash off the treatment after a six-hour exposure and the second cohort washing off the product after 24-hour exposure. Subjects were treated every three weeks for up to four treatments. Safety and efficacy measures were evaluated every three weeks. Primary efficacy measures were the percentage of subjects who achieved complete clearance by Day 42 
 7


(visit 3) and Day 84 (visit 5). Secondary efficacy measures included a quality of life assessment, as measured by the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index, or CDLQI, score, and the percentage of subjects who achieved clearance of at least 90% of their lesions with comparison to the efficacy data obtained with compounded cantharidin. The CDLQI scale is a validated tool for measuring the impact of skin disease on quality of life for subjects five to sixteen years of age and ranges from a score of 0 to 30. Lower CDLQI scores indicate lower impairment of a patient’s quality of life.
 In the Pilot Trial, our proprietary cantharidin formulation was applied to over 1,700 molluscum lesions in 30 subjects, and was observed to be well tolerated, with no serious adverse events or unexpected treatment related adverse events recorded. The trial’s first cohort investigated a six-hour treatment duration. Fourteen subjects were enrolled in this cohort and 13 subjects completed the trial. Of these 13 subjects, six showed complete clearance on or before Day 84 (visit 5) (46% complete clearance rate). The second cohort investigated a 24-hour treatment duration. Sixteen subjects were enrolled in this cohort and 12 completed the trial. Of these 12 subjects, five showed complete clearance on or before Day 84 (visit 5) (42% complete clearance rate).
 Other efficacy measures included lesion count and the CDLQI score. In the per-protocol group, the combined mean baseline lesion count was 23.0 and the combined mean lesion count at the end of trial was 6.8. The CDLQI score went from a combined average burden of 3.9 at baseline to 0.38 at the end of trial. While the majority of subjects went to a CDLQI score of 0 when completely clear of their disease, subjects felt an improvement in quality of life even if only partially cleared, supporting the idea that even lesion reduction is meaningful to patients.
 VP-102 for the Treatment of Common Warts
 We are also developing VP-102 for the treatment of common warts. Published studies and clinical use provide support for cantharidin as a safe and effective treatment for common warts. We believe that VP-102 has the potential to address many of the shortcomings associated with current therapies, including pain and discomfort, scarring, and lack of effectiveness. In addition, we believe VP-102’s convenient ease of administration will differentiate it from existing alternative unapproved therapies.
 We have an ongoing Phase 2 open-label clinical trial of VP-102 for the treatment of common warts, COVE-1, which has two cohorts enrolled successively and is assessing both safety and efficacy endpoints. We believe the results of this trial will inform the clinical design and statistical powering of future clinical trials.
 8


We have enrolled 21 subjects into the first cohort of the trial which is evaluating VP-102 applied once every 14 days for up to four applications to common warts on subjects two years and older. Following the initiation of the trial, we decided to amend the trial protocol to permit subjects in the first cohort to receive treatment with an interval of no less than every 14 days at the discretion of the investigator. A second cohort was added to the trial by amendment in November 2018 and completed enrollment of 33 patients on February 15, 2019.  The second cohort is evaluating a treatment regimen of VP-102 application once every 21 days for up to four applications in subjects 12 years and older.

 
Trial and Status | Formulation and Application Method | Trial Design | Trial Objectives 
Phase 2 COVE-1 Trial Ongoing | VP-102 | • Open-label, multi- center • 2 cohorts • Dosing regimens of 14 and 21 days evaluated for up to 4 applications • 24-hour treatment under occlusive tape • Wart paring allowed in the second cohort | • To evaluate safety and efficacy over four treatments 

 
We expect to report top-line results from this trial in the second quarter of 2019. If the results of our Phase 2 clinical trial are favorable, we intend to request an end of Phase 2 meeting in the second half of 2019.
 VP-102 for the Treatment of External Genital Warts
 We plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial with VP-102 in external genital warts in the first half of 2019. External genital warts are a viral skin disease caused by the human papilloma virus, or HPV, which forms lesions on the surface of the skin. An estimated 17% of the approximately 4.1 million patient visits for all types of warts are for the treatment of external genital warts. We believe VP-102 may have the potential to offer a safe and effective treatment for external genital warts because of the shared characteristics with molluscum.
 VP-103 for the Treatment of Plantar Warts
 We also intend to develop our second cantharidin-based product candidate, VP-103, for the treatment of plantar warts, which are warts located on the bottom of the foot. An estimated one-third of the approximately 4.1 million patient visits for all types of warts are for the treatment of plantar warts. To date, plantar warts have been difficult to treat, as they are refractory and available treatments often lead to both pain and scarring. We expect to conduct IND-enabling pre-clinical activities for VP-103 and to submit an IND to the FDA in the second half of 2019.
 Manufacturing
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We have been relying on third parties for the manufacture of the products for preclinical studies and clinical trials and will likely continue to rely on these third parties in the near term for the commercial manufacture of the drug products if they are approved during the initial commercial phase. Manufacturing of the API for our product candidates requires a raw material that is derived from a natural source.
 9


To date, we have obtained naturally-sourced cantharidin directly or indirectly from suppliers based in the People’s Republic of China. On July 16, 2018, we entered into a Supply Agreement, or the Supply Agreement, with Funing County Development Brucea Javanica Professional Cooperatives, or the Supplier, pursuant to which the Supplier has agreed to supply naturally-sourced cantharidin to us for a specified fixed price. Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, the Supplier has agreed that it will not supply cantharidin, any beetles or other raw material from which cantharidin is derived to any other customer in North America, subject to specified minimum annual purchase orders and forecasts. 
 Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, we have provided the Supplier with an initial purchase order and may submit additional purchase orders from time to time, so long as the purchase orders are at least six months prior to the proposed delivery date. 
 The term of the Supply Agreement is five years and thereafter will be renewed automatically for 12-month periods, unless terminated by either party at least 12 months prior to the end of the applicable term. In addition, either party has the right to terminate the Supply Agreement under certain circumstances, including (i) upon a material breach of the Supply Agreement if the breaching party has failed to remedy the breach within 45 days or if the breach is not capable of remedy within 45 days or (ii) the other party becomes insolvent or goes into liquidation. 
 Our contract manufacturers and primary packaging vendor are FDA-registered establishments and have a history of supplying products to the pharmaceutical industry.
 We have manufactured both the API as well as the drug product at batch sizes that should be indicative of commercial scale processing capability. We are confident of the ability to scale both processes to commercial size as they employ equipment that is routinely used in the pharmaceutical industry and the processes are well understood. Given the nature of both the API as well as several of the excipients, special handling will be required to minimize risks to personnel during processing. Analytical testing methods for both the API as well as the finished drug product have been developed and satisfactorily qualified to enable release of clinical materials for human use. It is expected that these methods will prove appropriate for release of commercial product with minimal additional effort.
 Our proprietary individual applicator and its parts are fabricated using common methods and materials and we currently plan to have our applicators built using semi-custom equipment performing well established automated assembly techniques.
 Commercialization
 We intend to commercialize VP-102, or any other product candidates that we may successfully develop, in the United States by building a specialized sales organization focused on pediatric dermatologists, dermatologists and select pediatricians. We believe a scientifically oriented, customer-focused team of approximately 50 to 60 sales representatives would allow us to reach the approximately 400 pediatric dermatologists and 9,000 dermatologists in the United States with the highest potential for using VP-102. In the future, we may develop and commercialize VP-102 for additional geographic regions, independently or with a strategic partner. We intend to seek drug product reimbursement for VP-102. Based on a survey of 40 physicians that we commissioned, 87% of physicians reported they would use VP-102 if the cost of the drug were covered. Furthermore, in April 2018, we commissioned a market research study, which surveyed 15 payor organizations representing over 105 million lives. The surveyed payors recognized that there is a significant unmet need for molluscum and a current lack of an effective treatment. Given the unmet need and the results of clinical trials of VP-102 to date, the surveyed payors anticipate the majority of patients would have access to VP-102, if approved, with minimal to no restrictions. We believe dermatologists tend to be particularly focused on the safety of pharmaceutical products because, while skin diseases can have profound effects on patients’ quality of life, few are life-threatening. As a result, we believe that dermatologists, as well as their patients, often prefer to use topical treatments when possible to limit the risk of systemic side effects. Dermatologists also tend to place a high level of emphasis on products that are easy to use because they often manage high volumes of patients. We believe this also contributes to a general preference for topical treatments. Finally, in our experience, dermatologists tend to engage with sales and medical affairs personnel from the pharmaceutical industry regarding the scientific evidence supporting dermatology products and the challenges experienced by physicians and patients in the use of these products. Dermatologists often rely on trusted relationships with scientifically oriented, customer-focused sales representatives who can provide them with the necessary information to support their use of appropriate treatments.

Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, compounding facilities, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of VP-102, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, pricing and stability. With respect to VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum, we will be primarily competing with therapies such as other topical products, curettage, cryotherapy, laser surgery, natural oils, off-label drugs, natural remedies and compounded unstandardized cantharidin. Under Section 503A of the FDCA, if VP-102 is approved, compounded topical cantharidin products with the same, similar or an easily substitutable dosage strength would be considered essentially copies of VP-102 and may not be compounded regularly or in inordinate amounts, subject to certain limited individual exceptions. These exceptions include if there is a difference between the compounded product and VP-102 that is made for an individual patient, and a prescribing practitioner determines produces a significant difference for that patient. In addition, pursuant to Section 503B of the FDCA, once VP-102 is approved, compounding facilities registered as outsourcing facilities would not be able to compound cantharidin products, unless there is a difference from VP-102 that produces a clinical difference for an individual patient, as determined by a prescribing practitioner. With respect to VP-102 for common warts and VP-103 for plantar warts, we will primarily be competing with over-the-counter products, cryotherapy, curettage, laser surgery, or other off-label therapies. There are currently no FDA-approved prescription pharmaceutical therapies for the treatment of molluscum, common warts, or plantar warts. With respect to VP-102 for external genital warts, we will be competing with cryosurgery, laser surgery, and topical destructive therapies such as trichloroacetic acid. There are also several FDA-approved prescription pharmaceutical therapies for external genital warts including imiquimod, podofilox, and sinecatechins. In addition, external genital warts are caused by HPV and may be prevented or treated by HPV vaccines that are FDA-approved.
 We are aware of several other product candidates in earlier stages of development as potential treatments for the indications we intend to target. Veloce Biopharma, Leo Pharma and Novan have initiated clinical trials with different programs in molluscum. There are a number of companies conducting late-stage clinical trials for common warts, including Aclaris Therapeutics and Cutanea Life Sciences. In addition, other drugs have been used off label as treatments for molluscum and common warts.
 Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for VP-102 and our proprietary applicator and any of our future product candidates, medical devices, synthetic methodologies, novel discoveries, drug development technologies and know-how; to operate without infringing on or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing or otherwise violating our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our product candidate and other proprietary technologies, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 While we seek broad coverage under our pending patent applications, our patent applications do not include any claims drawn to the active pharmaceutical agent cantharidin per se or for the broad use of our API alone for the treatment of warts or molluscum, although we have filed patent applications on our cantharidin preparations, cantharidin formulations, dosing regimens, methods of preparation including methods of synthesis, and methods of use. Despite these patent filings, there is always a risk that modification of the specific formulation, manufacturing process, method of application, and/or specific method of use may allow a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, patents, if granted, will expire, and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications.
 11


As of December 31, 2018, we have nationalized three international patent applications for utility patents, two of which have been nationalized in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, and Mexico, and one of which has been nationalized in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Two of these European patent applications have been registered in Hong Kong. In addition, we have three pending international patent applications and one patent application for a design patent. These patent applications relate to VP-102, our proprietary applicator, and other inventions related to VP-102. Our patent applications related to VP-102 and our proprietary applicator include proposed claims relating to (i) methods for the synthesis of cantharidin, (ii) our specific formulations and preparations of VP-102, (iii) methods for purifying cantharidin, (iv) methods for detecting impurities in cantharidin, (v) the design of our proprietary applicator, including both the general design and specific design elements, (vi) claims related to safety features included in the VP-102 formulation, including colorants and bittering agents, and (vii) the method of administration of VP-102 for the treatment of skin lesions. Excluding any patent term adjustment and patent term extension, utility patents to issue from these patent applications are projected to expire between 2034 and 2039. The design patent to issue from the design patent application will expire fifteen years from the date of issuance. We cannot provide any assurance as to whether any patents will be issued from these patent applications or, if any patents do issue, the scope of the claims that will be allowed.
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries, in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent, and extended to recapture a portion of the patent term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period of the drug covered by the patent. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years, the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval of the drug, and the extension may only apply to one patent that covers the approved drug (and to only those patent claims covering the approved drug or a method for using it). There can be no assurance that any such patent term adjustment or extension will be obtained. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

United States Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees; and
--+--------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 VP-102 is designed to be delivered to patients via a proprietary applicator. In the United States, products composed of components that would normally be regulated by different centers at the FDA are known as combination products. Typically, the FDA’s Office of Combination Products assigns a combination product to a specific Agency center as the lead reviewer. The FDA determines which center will lead a product’s review based upon the product’s primary mode of action. Depending on the type of combination product, its approval, clearance or licensure may usually be obtained through the submission of a single marketing application. We anticipate that VP-102 will be regulated as a drug, and that the FDA will permit a single regulatory submission seeking approval of VP-102 with the applicator. However, the FDA sometimes will require separate marketing applications for individual constituent parts of the combination product which may require additional time, effort, and information, and we cannot be certain that the FDA would not require independent clearance or approval for the proprietary applicator. Even when a single marketing application is required for a combination product, such as an NDA for a combination pharmaceutical and device product, both the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health may participate in the review. An applicant will also need to discuss with the Agency how to apply certain premarket requirements and post-marketing regulatory requirements, including conduct of clinical trials, adverse event reporting and good manufacturing practices, to their combination product.

Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective and a clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted, at least annually, to the FDA, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements, or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 14


Marketing Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has sixty days from receipt to make a decision as to whether the application has been accepted for filing.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 as amended and reauthored, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 15


Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Special Protocol Assessment
 A sponsor may request a SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins for a SPA to be approved. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented in a SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA and made part of the administrative record.
 Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement under the following circumstances:
  
• | public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, or the director of the review division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy has been identified after testing has begun;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a sponsor fails to follow a protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by the sponsor in a request for SPA change, are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A documented SPA may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if the FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. A SPA, however, does not guarantee that a trial will be successful.
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the referenced drug, to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) the date on which such patent expires or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The fourth certification described above is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. This section viii statement does not require notice to the patent holder or NDA owner. There might also be no relevant patent certification.
 If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. Even if the 45 days expire, a patent infringement lawsuit can be brought and could delay market entry, but it would not extend the FDA-related 30-month stay of approval.
 16


The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired. Specifically, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of an NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification. This exclusivity period may be extended by an additional six months if certain requirements are met to qualify the product for pediatric exclusivity, including the receipt of a written request from the FDA that we conduct certain pediatric studies, the submission of study reports from such studies to the FDA after receipt of the written request and satisfaction of the conditions specified in the written request.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or other labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual program fee requirements for any marketed products.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 17


The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications. Companies may also share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Regulation of Compounding Pharmacies
 Compounding is a practice in which a licensed pharmacist, a licensed physician, or in the case of an outsourcing facility, a person under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist, combines, mixes, or alters ingredients of a drug to create a medication tailored to the needs of an individual patient. Although we are not engaged in compounding, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our product candidate VP-102 has historically been used in the compounding of topical pharmaceutical products, and we could be subject to competition by compounders upon approval of VP-102, subject to the requirements set forth in Sections 503A and 503B of the FDCA.
 Section 503A of the FDCA exempts licensed pharmacists or licensed physicians who compound products for identified, individual patients, based on the receipt of a valid prescription order, from the FDCA’s new drug approval requirements, cGMP requirements, and the requirement to label products with adequate directions for use, provided certain conditions are met. These conditions include that the pharmacist or physician does not compound regularly or in inordinate amounts any drug product that is essentially a copy of a commercially available drug product, unless there is a difference between the compounded product and the commercially available product that is made for an individual patient, and which the prescribing practitioner determines produces a significant difference for that patient. The FDA has interpreted this prohibition to mean that the compounding of a product with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as a commercially available drug, that has the same, similar, or an easily substitutable dosage strength as the commercially available drug, and that can be used by the same route of administration as the commercially available drug, cannot be conducted under Section 503A usually, very often, or at regular times or intervals, or more frequently or in larger quantities than needed to address unanticipated emergency circumstance, unless the limited exception described above applies.
 In addition, compounding under Section 503A may only use bulk drug substances that appear on a list issued by FDA through regulations, and/or that comply with certain other conditions specified in the statute.
 Unlike Section 503A, Section 503B of the FDCA allows certain entities to compound drugs that are not necessarily prepared in response to prescriptions for identified, individual patients. Such facilities must register with the FDA as outsourcing facilities, and once registered (including payment of a fee), the outsourcing facility must meet certain conditions in order to be exempt from the FDCA’s approval requirements and the requirement to label products with adequate directions for use. Under Section 503B, a drug must be compounded in compliance with cGMP, by or under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist in order to be so exempt. The outsourcing facility must also report specific information about the products that it compounds, including a list of all of the products it compounded during the previous six months, and information about the compounded products, such as the source of the active ingredients used to compound pursuant to Section 503B(b)(2). If the outsourcing facility compounds using bulk drug substances, the bulk drug substances must either appear on a list established by the FDA of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need or be used to compound drugs that appear on a list established by the FDA of drugs for which there is a shortage. Although the FDA has not yet established a list of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need, the FDA has announced an interim policy pursuant to which bulk drug substances may be nominated for inclusion on such list and, provided certain conditions are met, outsourcing facilities may compound with such bulk drug substances pending evaluation of the substances for inclusion on the FDA’s list of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need. Cantharidin is currently listed among those nominated substances for which bulk drug substance may be used in compounding by outsourcing facilities pending 
 18


FDA’s evaluation. In March 2019, the FDA issued Guidance for Industry addressing the criteria by which the FDA intends to evaluate whether there exists a clinical need for compounding with a bulk drug substance, including, in the case of a bulk drug substance that is a component of an FDA-approved drug, an evaluation of whether there exists an attribute of the approved drug that makes it medically unsuitable to treat certain patients; whether the drug product proposed to be compounded is intended to address that attribute; and whether the drug product proposed to be compounded must be compounded from a bulk drug substance rather than from the finished, FDA-approved drug product. If FDA implements these criteria as in the Guidance for Industry, and if VP-102 is approved, an outsourcing facility would need to satisfy these criteria before being permitted to compound a cantharidin product using bulk cantharidin.
 In addition, an outsourcing facility must meet other conditions described in Section 503B, including reporting adverse events and labeling compounded products with certain information. Registered outsourcing facilities are prohibited from selling compounded drugs through a wholesale distributor, or from compounding drugs that are essentially copies of FDA-approved drugs. A drug is “essentially a copy of an approved drug” if it is identical or nearly identical to an approved drug, which the FDA has interpreted to mean that it has the same active ingredient(s), route of administration, dosage form, dosage strength and excipients as the approved drug, or if it has the same active ingredient as an approved drug and there is not a change from the approved drug that produces a clinical difference for an individual patient, as determined by the prescribing practitioner. Registered outsourcing facilities are subject to FDA inspection, and FDA conducts inspections on a risk-based frequency under Section 503B(b)(4) of the FDCA.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities, and proposed sales, marketing and education programs and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those laws described below.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and other individuals and entities on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance to offer protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
 In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act and the civil monetary penalties statute.
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 19


The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization on certain health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates, independent contractors that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 We may also be subject to state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws; state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; as well as state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participating in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

Coverage and Reimbursement
 Market acceptance and sales of any drug products depend in part on coverage and the extent to which adequate reimbursement for drug products will be available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and other private health insurers. Coverage and reimbursement for our product also depends on coverage and adequate reimbursement for the procedures using VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum and/or common warts. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. Separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which our product is used may not be available. Even if the procedure using our product is covered, third-party payors may package the cost of the drug into the procedure payment and not separately reimburse the physician for the costs associated with our product. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover or separately reimburse for our products could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved. Additionally, in the United States, there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among third-party payors. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided is made on a payor-by-payor basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement.
 Third-party payors determine which medical procedures they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Even if a third-party payor covers a particular procedure, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate. Patients who are treated in-office for a medical condition generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the procedure and may be unwilling to undergo such procedures for the treatment of molluscum and/or common warts in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement.
 Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that a procedure is safe, effective, and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed medical journals; included in clinical practice guidelines; and neither cosmetic, experimental, nor investigational.
 Further, from time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment rates are updated and revised by third-party payors. Such updates could impact the demand for our product candidates, to the extent that customers who are prescribed our product candidates, if approved, are not separately reimbursed for the cost of the product candidates. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program updates to physician payments, which is done on an annual basis. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, ended the use of the statutory formula and provided for a 0.5% annual increase in payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2019, but no annual update from 2020 through 2025. MACRA also introduced a merit-based incentive bonus program for Medicare physicians beginning in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the merit-based incentive program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program.
 Impact of Healthcare Reform on our Business
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of drug product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of drug product candidates.

Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things: (i) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (ii) established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs; (iii) expanded the availability of lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (iv) increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP; (v) expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability; (vi) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and (vii) established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug.
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.

Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, may affect rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. While a number of these and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 16 full-time employees. All of our employees are located in the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 Insurance
 We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage for our products and clinical trials in amounts consistent with industry standards. However, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and we may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.
