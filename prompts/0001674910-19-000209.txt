ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
Valvoline Inc., a Kentucky corporation, is a worldwide marketer and supplier of engine and automotive maintenance products and services. The terms “Valvoline,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “management” and “our” as used herein refer to Valvoline Inc., its predecessors and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where the context indicates otherwise. On September 28, 2016, Valvoline completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common stock and trades on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “VVV.”
Valvoline™ is one of the most recognized and respected premium consumer brands in the global automotive lubricant industry, known for its innovative, high quality products and superior levels of service. Established in 1866, Valvoline’s heritage spans over 150 years, during which it was the petroleum industry’s first U.S. trademarked motor oil brand and has developed powerful name recognition across multiple product and service channels. In addition to the iconic Valvoline-branded passenger car motor oils and other automotive lubricant products, Valvoline provides a wide array of lubricants used in heavy duty equipment, as well as automotive chemicals and fluids designed to improve engine performance and lifespan. 
Valvoline has a strong international presence with products sold in more than 140 countries. In the United States and Canada, Valvoline’s products and services are sold to retailers with over 50,000 retail outlets, to installer customers with over 15,000 locations, and through 1,385 company-owned and franchised stores. 
Company background
Valvoline was incorporated in May 2016 as a subsidiary of Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (which together with its predecessors and consolidated subsidiaries is referred to herein as “Ashland”). Prior to this time, Valvoline operated as an unincorporated commercial unit of Ashland. Following a series of restructuring steps prior to the IPO, the Valvoline business was transferred from Ashland to Valvoline such that the Valvoline business included substantially all of the historical Valvoline business reported by Ashland, as well as certain other legacy Ashland assets and liabilities transferred to Valvoline from Ashland (the “Contribution”). In connection with the IPO, 34.5 million shares of Valvoline common stock were sold to investors and Ashland retained 170 million shares representing 83% of the total outstanding shares of Valvoline common stock. 
On May 12, 2017, Ashland distributed all of its remaining interest in Valvoline to Ashland stockholders (the “Distribution”) through a pro rata dividend on shares of Ashland common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date of May 5, 2017, which marked the completion of Valvoline’s separation from Ashland. Effective upon the Distribution, Ashland no longer owned any shares of Valvoline common stock, and Valvoline was no longer a controlled and consolidated subsidiary of Ashland.

Industry overview
Valvoline participates primarily in the global finished lubricants market. In total, global annual lubricants demand is estimated to be approximately 12 billion gallons. Demand for passenger car motor oil and motorcycle oil is estimated to account for 22% of global lubricant demand. Heavy-duty oil, tractor oil and other transport lubricants accounts for another 41%, while the remaining 37% of global lubricant demand is comprised of non-transport lubricants such as hydraulic oil, gear oil, process oil and greases. The United States has historically accounted for the largest portion of lubricant demand, but has recently been passed by China, with India third. The lubricants market is impacted by the following key drivers and trends:
•Global transportation lubricants market demand is shifting towards higher performance finished lubricants, largely driven by advancements in vehicle/equipment design as well as more rigorous OEM and regulatory requirements for improved efficiency, optimized fuel consumption along with reduced carbon footprints and toxic emissions.
•Recent multiyear trends indicate that the North American transport lubricants market has experienced relatively flat average annual volumes due in part to an increase in oil change intervals, which have resulted from the shift towards higher performance lubricants, offset by an increase in the number of automobiles on the road and miles driven.
•Continued growth in the number of vehicles on the road has led to expansion of passenger vehicle lubricant sales in developing regions. 
Reportable segments
Valvoline’s reporting structure is composed of three reportable segments: Quick Lubes, Core North America, and International. Additionally, to reconcile to consolidated results, certain corporate and other non-operational matters are included in Unallocated and other. Refer to the below for a description of each reportable segment: 
Quick Lubes
The Quick Lubes segment services the passenger car and light truck quick lube market through company-owned, independent franchises and joint venture retail quick lube service center stores, as well as independent Express Care stores that service vehicles with Valvoline products. Valvoline operates the second largest quick lube service chain by number of stores in the United States with Valvoline Instant Oil ChangeSM (“VIOC”) and the third largest quick lube service chain in Canada with the Valvoline Great Canadian Oil Change brand. Valvoline’s quick lube service center stores offer customers a quick, easy and trusted way to maintain their vehicles, utilizing well-trained technicians who have access to a proprietary service process that sets forth rigorous protocols for both the steps that must be followed in the service of vehicles and for interactions with customers. The Express Care™ platform supports smaller North American operators that do not fit Valvoline’s franchise model and generally offer other services in addition to quick lubes, such as automotive repairs and car washes. Joint venture service center stores operate in eastern China throughout the Shandong province. As of September 30, 2019, the Quick Lubes system consisted of 519 company-owned and 866 franchised locations and operated in 46 states in the U.S. and five provinces in Canada. As of September 30, 2019, there were 307 Express Care™ locations in the U.S. and Canada and five joint venture service center locations in China. 
Core North America 
The Core North America segment sells Valvoline™ and other branded and private label engine and automotive maintenance products in the United States and Canada to retailers for consumers to perform their own automotive and engine maintenance, as well as to installers that service vehicles and equipment for consumers. Sales of Valvoline products for consumers to perform their own automotive and engine maintenance are referred to as “Do-It-Yourself” or “DIY” consumers, and sales of Valvoline products for consumers to have their vehicles and equipment serviced are referred to as “Do-It-For-Me” or “DIFM” consumers. Sales for DIY consumers are primarily branded products sold through the retail channel to customers such as retail automotive parts stores, as well as to leading mass merchandisers and independent automotive part stores. Sales through the retail channel also include non-branded packaged goods to warehouse distributors that resell to both DIY consumers and to installers for DIFM consumers. Sales for DIFM consumers are generally sold through the installer channel to customers such as car dealers, general repair shops and third-party quick lube locations directly as well as through a network of distributors. Valvoline also sells products to heavy duty fleet customers, such as on-highway fleets and construction companies through the installer distributor network. Valvoline also has a strategic relationship with Cummins Inc. (“Cummins”), a leading supplier of heavy duty engines, for co-branding products for heavy duty consumers. Other sales within Core North America include OEM and specialty customers.
International
Valvoline’s International segment sells Valvoline™ and other branded engine and automotive products through wholly-owned affiliates, joint ventures, licensees and independent distributors in more than 140 countries outside of the United States and Canada for the maintenance of consumer and commercial vehicles and equipment. Key international regions include Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central and South America); and Asia Pacific (Australia and Asia, including India and China). Valvoline has a growing presence in a number of emerging markets, including China, India and Latin America. International sales include products for both light duty and heavy duty. Light duty products are sold internationally primarily through distributors to installer customers. Heavy duty products are sold either directly to key customers or through distributors. Valvoline has 50/50 joint ventures with Cummins in India, China and Argentina and joint ventures with other partners in Latin America.
Unallocated and other 
Certain corporate and non-operational matters, such as net pension and other postretirement plan expense, company-wide restructuring activities and adjustments related to legacy businesses that are no longer attributed to Valvoline are generally included within Unallocated and other. 
Business and growth strategies
The strength of Valvoline’s business model is the ability to generate profitable sales across multiple channels to market, leveraging the strength of the Valvoline brand through effective marketing, innovative product technology and the capabilities of the Valvoline team. Valvoline has delivered strong profits and return on capital, with balanced results. Today, Valvoline leverages its multi-channel model to deliver solid margins, generate high free cash flow, and provide significant growth opportunities. Valvoline’s key business and growth strategies include:
•Aggressively growing Quick Lubes through organic service center expansion and opportunistic acquisitions, while enhancing retail service capabilities through a consistent and preferred customer experience delivered by hands-on experts; 
•Strengthening and maintaining the foundation in Core North America by leveraging investments in technology and marketing to drive speed, efficiency and value across the business and customer interactions, while increasing penetration of Valvoline’s full product portfolio;
•Accelerating International market share growth through continued development of and investment in key emerging and high value markets; 
•Broadening capabilities to serve future transport vehicles by developing relationships with OEMs and leveraging innovation in the development of future products and light services in direct and adjacent markets; and
•Accelerating the shift to a services-driven business by leveraging customer relationships and experiences to develop new capabilities globally. 
Quick Lubes store development 
During fiscal 2019, Valvoline acquired 60 service center stores, which included 31 franchise service center stores acquired from Oil Changers Inc. on October 31, 2018, five former franchise service centers stores, and 24 service center stores acquired in single and multi-store transactions. These acquisitions continue to expand Valvoline's Quick Lubes system in underdeveloped market opportunity areas within North America and included the first company-owned service center stores outside the U.S. in Canada. During the last five fiscal years from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2019, Valvoline acquired a total of 346 service center stores, which included 146 franchise service center stores, 88 former franchise service center stores, and 112 service center stores acquired in single and multi-store transactions. These acquisitions included the Company’s first international quick lube service center store acquisition and began Valvoline's expansion into Canada with franchise service center stores. 
As of September 30, 2019, Valvoline operated, either directly or through its franchisees, 1,385 quick lube service center stores, a net increase of 143 over the prior year. In addition to the 60 acquired stores added to the Quick Lubes system, 28 newly-constructed company-owned stores and franchisee expansion in key markets combined to add 83 net new stores to the system during fiscal 2019. Since fiscal 2015, the Quick Lubes system added 443 net new stores, primarily through opportunistic acquisitions as noted above, as well as new store development with newly-constructed company-owned stores and franchisee expansion. As of September 30, 2019, the Quick Lubes system consisted of 519 company-owned and 866 franchised locations and operated in 46 states in the U.S. and five provinces in Canada and 307 Express Care™ locations in the U.S. and Canada. During fiscal 2019, Valvoline invested in a joint venture in China to pilot expansion of retail quick lube service center stores outside of North America, and as of September 30, 2019, there were five joint venture locations in operation. 
VIOC delivered system-wide same-store sales growth of 10.1% in fiscal 2019, a record for full-year system-wide same-store sales growth and the 13th consecutive year of system-wide same-store sales growth (determined on a fiscal year basis for company-owned and franchised stores, with new stores excluded from the metric until the completion of their first full fiscal year in operation).
Competition
The industry is highly competitive and Valvoline faces competition in all product categories and subcategories. Competition is based on several key criteria, including brand recognition, product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, ability to develop products in cooperation with customers and customer service, as well as the ability to bring innovative products or services to the marketplace.
The Quick Lubes segment competes with other major franchised brands that offer a turn-key operations management system, such as Jiffy Lube (owned by Shell), Grease Monkey, Take 5 Oil Change, Express Oil Change and Mr. Lube, as well as national branded companies that offer a professional signage program with limited business model support, similar to Valvoline’s Express Care network, as well as regional players such as American Lube Fast and Avis Lube that are not directly affiliated with a major brand. Valvoline also competes to some degree with automotive dealerships and service centers, which provide quick lube and other preventative maintenance services. Valvoline believes there are approximately 9,000 existing quick lube stores currently operating in the U.S. market. Jiffy Lube is currently the Company’s largest competitor by number of stores with approximately 1,900 stores owned or operated by franchisees in 
the U.S. The Canadian quick lubes market is similarly fragmented with a small number of large players that comprise roughly half of the market, while the remainder is made up of smaller local and regional competitors, automotive dealerships and service stations.
In the Core North America segment, Valvoline’s principal competitors for retail customers are global integrated oil brands, such as Shell, which produces Pennzoil and Quaker State; BP, which produces Castrol; Exxon Mobil, which produces Mobil 1; as well as mid-tier brands and private label producers. Valvoline currently ranks as the number three passenger car motor oil brand in the DIY market by volume. With respect to installer customers in the United States and Canada, Valvoline competes with these same major integrated oil brands, many of which have significantly greater financial resources and more diverse portfolios of products and services, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility.
Major competitors of Valvoline’s International segment vary by region. Valvoline generally faces strong competition from global integrated oil brands, as these companies have a particularly strong presence in Europe and Asia. In certain markets, Valvoline also competes with regional brands, including brands produced by national oil companies, such as Sinopec in China and Indian Oil in India.
Competitive factors in all of these markets include price, innovation of solutions, brand awareness and loyalty, customer service, and sales and marketing. Valvoline’s Core North America and International reportable segments also compete at retailers on the basis of shelf space and product packaging.
Marketing and sales
Valvoline places a high priority on sales and marketing and focuses marketing efforts on areas expected to yield the highest rate of return. Valvoline has a centralized marketing services group as well as dedicated marketing resources in each reportable segment, which are well qualified to reach target customers. The majority of Valvoline’s large customers are supported by direct sales representatives with a number of key customers having dedicated Valvoline teams. In addition, Valvoline has a number of distributors within the Core North America and International reportable segments that represent the Company’s products. In Core North America, Valvoline products are sold to consumers through over 50,000 retail outlets, to installer customers with over 15,000 locations, and in Quick Lubes through 1,385 company-owned and franchised stores, 307 Express Care™ locations, and five joint venture locations. Valvoline serves its customer base through its sales force and technical support organization, allowing leverage of the Company’s technology portfolio and customer relationships globally, while meeting customer demands locally. Valvoline also utilizes its digital infrastructure and technology to more efficiently interact with customers, driving customer engagement to deliver growth, customer retention and acquisition. 
Valvoline uses a variety of marketing techniques to build awareness of, and create demand for, Valvoline products and services. Valvoline advertises through social and digital media, as well as traditional media outlets such as television and radio. Valvoline selectively sponsors teams in high performance racing, including a current sponsorship of Hendrick Motorsports, featuring drivers Chase Elliott, Jimmie Johnson, William Byron and Alex Bowman. In addition, Valvoline sponsors other teams and players, including the Manchester City Football Club and the Memphis Grizzlies, as well as Valvoline’s joint venture sponsorship of renowned Indian cricket player, Virat Kohli. 
Research and development
Valvoline's research and development is focused on developing new and innovative services and products to meet the current and future needs of its customers. These services and products are developed through Valvoline’s “Hands on Expertise” innovation approach, which begins with the mathematical modeling of critical product design elements and extends through in store testing and vehicle performance testing. In addition, Valvoline technology centers, located in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, develop solutions for existing and emerging on and off-road equipment. Valvoline’s research and development team also leverages its strong relationships with customers and suppliers to incorporate their feedback into the research and development process. In addition to its own research and development initiatives, Valvoline also conducts limited testing for other entities, which builds its expertise and partially offsets its research and development costs. Valvoline will continue to incur research and development expenditures in the future to develop innovative, high-quality products and services and to help maintain and enhance Valvoline’s competitive position.
Intellectual property
Valvoline is continually seeking to develop new technology and enhance its existing technology. Valvoline has been issued approximately 40 U.S. and 70 international patents and has nearly 35 U.S. and 90 international patent applications pending or published. Valvoline also holds over 2,500 trademarks in various countries around the world, which Valvoline believes are some of its most valuable assets. These trademarks include the Valvoline trademark and the famous “V” brand logo trademark, which are registered in over 150 countries. In addition, Valvoline uses various trade names and service marks in its business, including ValvolineTM and Valvoline Instant Oil ChangeSM, among others and including those for key products. Valvoline also has a variety of intellectual property licensing agreements. Valvoline owns over 700 domain names that are used to promote Valvoline products and services and provide information about the Company.
Raw material supply and prices
The key raw materials used in Valvoline’s business are base oils, additives, packaging materials (high density polyethylene bottles, corrugated packaging and steel drums) and ethylene glycol. Valvoline continuously monitors global supply and cost trends of these key raw materials and obtains these raw materials from a diversified network of large global suppliers and regional providers. Valvoline’s sourcing strategy is to ensure supply through contracting with a diversified supply base while leveraging market conditions to take advantage of spot opportunities whenever such conditions are available. Valvoline leverages worldwide spend to pursue favorable contract terms from global suppliers and utilizes regional providers to ensure market competitiveness and reliability in its supply chain. For materials that must be customized, Valvoline works with market leaders with global footprints and well-developed business continuity plans. Valvoline also utilizes the Company’s research and development resources to develop alternative product formulations, which provide flexibility in the event of supply interruptions. Valvoline closely monitors the Company’s supply chain and conducts annual supply risk assessments of its critical suppliers to reduce risk.
Valvoline has a large manufacturing and distribution footprint in the United States, with seven lubricant blending and packaging plants and several packaging and warehouse locations. Additional blending and packaging plants are located in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and a recently acquired facility in Eastern Europe. Valvoline is also in the process of building its first blending and packaging plant in China, which when complete is expected to have annual capacity in excess of 30 million gallons of lubricants and coolants. The plant is currently on schedule for production to begin in early fiscal 2021. Valvoline also uses numerous third-party toll manufacturers and warehouses both in the US and internationally and is part of joint ventures that operate blending and packaging facilities in Ecuador and India.
Valvoline seeks to actively manage fluctuations in supply costs, product selling prices and the timing thereof to preserve margins. The prices of many of Valvoline’s products fluctuate based on the price of base oil, which is a large percentage of Valvoline’s cost of sales. Given that base oil, a derivative of crude, is highly correlated to the global oil market, there can be volatility in base oil prices. The amount of volatility is related to the world crude price as well as to the global supply and demand balance of base oil. Base oil prices generally follow crude prices, but the lag period between changes in the price of crude oil and changes in the price of base oil is influenced by whether there is an excess of or shortness in the supply of base oil. 
Valvoline works diligently to adjust product selling prices to react to changes in base oil costs and protect margins. As part of the strategy to mitigate the impact of base oil volatility, Valvoline has negotiated base oil supply contracts with terms that have reduced the impact of changes in the base oil market on Valvoline’s financial results. Valvoline contracts in several of the Company’s sales channels accelerate the timing of adjustments to selling prices in response to changes in raw material prices. Pricing adjustments to products sold to Valvoline’s larger national or regional installer customer accounts are generally made pursuant to their contracts and are often based on movements in published base oil indices. Pricing for product sold to Valvoline’s franchisees is adjusted on a periodic basis pursuant to an agreed upon index (weighted combination of published base oil indices), the composition and weighting of which may be updated from time to time by Valvoline and representatives of Valvoline’s franchisees. Pricing adjustments for product sold to retail customers, private label products in the United States and product sold to smaller installer customer accounts are generally market driven, based on negotiations in light of base oil costs and the pricing strategies of Valvoline’s competitors. 
Backlog
Although Valvoline may experience availability constraints from time to time for certain products, orders are generally filled within 30 days of receiving them. Therefore, Valvoline usually has a product backlog of less than 30 days at any one time, which the Company does not consider material to its business.
Seasonality
Overall, there is little seasonality in Valvoline’s business. Valvoline’s Quick Lubes business, and to a lesser extent, its Core North America business tend to experience slightly higher sales volume in the summer months due to summer vacations and increased driving, as well as during the periods of time leading into holidays. Both businesses also tend to slow a little from October to February due to inclement weather in parts of the United States and Canada. Valvoline’s International business experiences little seasonality due to its geographic diversity and the high percentage of its business in the commercial and industrial lubricants market, which is less influenced by weather.
Environmental and regulatory matters
Valvoline is subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental health and safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as safe working conditions; product stewardship; air emissions; discharges to the land and surface waters; generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials; and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. Valvoline maintains policies and procedures to control EHS risks and monitor compliance with applicable EHS laws and regulations. These laws and regulations also require Valvoline to obtain and comply with permits, registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities. These authorities can modify or revoke the Company’s permits, registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions. Valvoline expects to incur ongoing costs to comply with existing and future EHS requirements, including the cost of dedicated EHS resources that are responsible for ensuring its business maintains compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
Valvoline is also subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies and by the applicable regulatory authorities in countries in which Valvoline’s products are manufactured and sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, classification, labeling, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, advertising and marketing of Valvoline’s products. In addition, the Company is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") and other countries’ anti-corruption and anti-bribery regimes.
While there are no current regulatory matters that Valvoline expects to be material to its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows, there can be no assurances that existing or future environmental laws and other regulations applicable to the Company’s operations or products will not lead to a material adverse impact on Valvoline’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Employees
As of September 30, 2019, Valvoline had approximately 7,900 employees worldwide (excluding contract employees).
