ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
GENERAL
Gartner, Inc. (NYSE: IT) is the world’s leading research and advisory company and a member of the S&P 500. We equip business leaders with indispensable insights, advice and tools to achieve their goals and build the successful organizations of tomorrow. We believe we have an unmatched combination of expert-led, practitioner-sourced and data-driven research that steers clients toward the right decisions on the issues that matter most. We’re a trusted advisor and an objective resource for more than 15,000 organizations in more than 100 countries — across all major functions, in every industry and enterprise size. 
Gartner delivers its products and services globally through three business segments: 

• | Research provides trusted, objective insights and advice on the mission-critical priorities of leaders across all functional areas of the enterprise through research and other reports, briefings, proprietary tools, access to our analysts and advisors, peer networking services and membership programs that enable our clients to make better decisions. Gartner's traditional strengths in IT, marketing and supply chain research were enhanced in 2017 with Gartner's acquisition of CEB Inc., which added CEB's best practice and talent management research insights across a range of business functions, to include human resources, finance, sales and legal.


• | Conferences (formerly called Events) provides business professionals across the organization the opportunity to learn, share and network. From our flagship CIO conference Gartner IT Symposium, to industry-leading conferences focused on specific business roles and topics, to member-driven sessions, our offerings enable attendees to experience the best of Gartner insight and advice live.


• | Consulting provides customized solutions to unique client needs through on-site, day-to-day support, as well as proprietary tools for measuring and improving IT performance with a focus on cost, performance, efficiency and quality.

References to “the Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” are to Gartner, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
MARKET OVERVIEW 
Technology increasingly drives organizational strategies rather than just supporting them, and three megaforces - technology-driven industry disruption, the growing pervasiveness of technology across every part of the enterprise, and sustained macroeconomic and political volatility (such as commodity price swings, exchange rate flux, Brexit) - are rapidly changing how businesses and other organizations plan and operate. 
To remain viable and competitive, business leaders must deal with this unprecedented level of disruption and change. No enterprise can be operationally effective unless it incorporates the right technology and related strategy and management decisions into every part of its business. This affects all business levels, functions and roles. Chief financial officers, heads of human resources, chief marketing officers and other executives and leaders across the enterprise are more reliant on technology than ever. Given this critical need, business enterprises, governments and their agencies, and other organizations turn to Gartner for decision-making guidance to ensure they maximize their technology investments and meet their current and future needs. 
Our legacy of expertise in IT has given way to a new position: Strategic research and advisory services operating across the entire organization. We believe our best-in-class Gartner content, combined with the CEB expertise in functional areas that we integrated during 2018, has strengthened our value proposition and increased our market opportunity to an all-time high.
OUR SOLUTION
We believe our unmatched combination of expert-led, practitioner-sourced, data-driven research steers clients toward the right decisions on the issues that matter most. We employ a diversified business model that utilizes and leverages the breadth and depth of our intellectual capital. The foundation of our business model is our ability to create and distribute our proprietary research content as broadly as possible via published reports, interactive tools, facilitated peer networking, briefings, consulting and advisory services, and our conferences, including the Gartner Symposium/XpoTM series.
We had 2,114 research analysts and expert advisors as of December 31, 2018 located around the world who create and deliver compelling, relevant, independent and objective research and fact-based analysis on virtually every function across the enterprise.

Through our robust product portfolio, our global research and advisory team provides thought leadership and insights that CIOs and other technology practitioners, HR, sales, legal, finance, supply chain and marketing executives need to make the right decisions, every day.
In addition to our research analysts and expert advisors, as of December 31, 2018, we had 718 experienced consultants who combine our objective, independent research with a practical business perspective focused on the IT industry. Finally, our conferences are some of the largest of their kind, gathering together highly qualified audiences that include CIOs and other IT and C-suite executives, frontline IT architects and professionals, purchasers and providers of technology and supply chain products and services, business professionals, and other leaders across marketing, finance, legal, sales and HR.
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and sources of value for our clients that facilitate increased client spending on our research and advisory services, consulting services and conferences. A critical part of our long-term strategy is to increase business volume and penetration with our most valuable clients, identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and advice. We also seek to extend the Gartner brand name to develop new client relationships, augment our sales capacity and expand into new markets around the world. In addition, we seek to increase our revenue and operating cash flow through more effective pricing of our products and services. These initiatives have created additional revenue streams through more effective packaging, campaigning and cross-selling of our products and services.
Our principal products and services are delivered through our three business segments: 

• | RESEARCH. Gartner delivers independent, objective advice to leaders across the enterprise, primarily through a subscription-based digital media service. Gartner research is the fundamental building block for all Gartner services. We combine our proprietary research methodologies with extensive industry and academic relationships to create Gartner solutions that address each role across the enterprise. Within the Research segment, Global Technology Sales ("GTS") delivers products and services to users and providers of technology, while Global Business Sales ("GBS") delivers products and services to all other functional leaders.

Our research agenda is defined by clients’ needs, focusing on the critical issues, opportunities and challenges they face every day. We are in steady contact with over 15,000 distinct organizations worldwide. We publish tens of thousands of pages of original research annually, and our analysts have over 380,000 client interactions every year. Our size and scale enable us to commit vast resources toward broader and deeper research coverage, and to deliver insight to our clients based on what they need and where they are. The ongoing interaction of our research analysts and advisors with our clients enables us to identify the most pertinent topics to them and develop relevant product enhancements to meet the evolving needs of users of our research. Our proprietary research content, presented in the form of reports, briefings, updates and related tools, is delivered directly to the client’s desktop via our website and/or product-specific portals.
Clients normally sign subscription contracts that provide access to our research content and advisory services for individual users over a defined period of time. We typically have a minimum contract period of 12 months for our research and advisory subscription contracts and at December 31, 2018, a significant portion of our contracts were multi-year. 

• | CONFERENCES. Gartner attracts more than 80,000 business and technology professionals and industry-leading technology providers to its 70+ conferences worldwide each year. Attendees experience sessions led by Gartner analysts and advisors, cutting-edge technology solutions, peer exchange workshops, one-on-one analyst and advisor meetings, consulting diagnostic workshops, keynotes and more. They also provide attendees with an opportunity to interact with business executives from the world’s leading technology companies. In addition to role-specific summits and workshop-style seminars, Gartner holds its unique, flagship IT Symposium/XpoTM in nine locations worldwide annually. Since the addition of CEB, we’ve expanded to host 700+ more intimate live meetings each year, as well as 250+ exclusive C-level meetings through the Evanta brand.


• | CONSULTING. Gartner Consulting deepens relationships with our largest research and advisory clients by extending the reach of our research through custom consulting engagements. Gartner Consulting brings together our unique research insight, benchmarking data, problem-solving methodologies and hands-on experience to improve the return on a client’s IT investment. Our consultants provide fact-based consulting services to help clients use and manage IT to optimize business performance.

Consulting solutions capitalize on Gartner assets that are invaluable to IT decision making, including: (1) our extensive research, which ensures that our consulting analyses and advice are based on a deep understanding of the IT environment and the business of IT; (2) our market independence, which keeps our consultants focused on our clients' success; and (3) our

market-leading benchmarking capabilities, which provide relevant comparisons and best practices to assess and improve performance. Gartner Consulting provides solutions to CIOs and other IT executives, and to those professionals responsible for IT applications, enterprise architecture, go-to-market strategies, infrastructure and operations, program and portfolio management, and sourcing and vendor relationships. Gartner Consulting also provides targeted consulting services to professionals in specific industries. Finally, we provide actionable solutions for IT cost optimization, technology modernization and IT sourcing optimization initiatives.
COMPETITION
We believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are:

• | Superior research content - We believe that we create the broadest, highest-quality and most relevant research coverage across all major functional roles in the enterprise. Our research analysis generates unbiased insight that we believe is timely, thought-provoking and comprehensive, and that is known for its high quality, independence and objectivity.


• | Our leading brand name - We have provided critical, trusted insight under the Gartner name for nearly 40 years.


• | Our global footprint and established customer base - We have a global presence with clients in more than 100 countries on six continents. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside of the United States.


• | Experienced management team - Our management team is composed of research veterans and experienced industry executives with long tenure at Gartner.


• | Substantial operating leverage in our business model - We have the ability to distribute our intellectual property and expertise across multiple platforms, including research publications, consulting engagements, conferences and executive programs, to derive incremental revenue and profitability.


• | Vast network of analysts, advisors and consultants - As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,114 research analysts and expert advisors and 718 experienced consultants located around the world. Our analysts and advisors collectively speak 59 languages and are located in 26 countries, enabling us to cover vast aspects of business and technology on a global basis.

Notwithstanding these differentiating factors, we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services. We compete indirectly with consulting firms and other data and information providers, including electronic and print media companies. These indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future. In addition, we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet. Limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business. As a result, new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services. While we believe the breadth and depth of our research positions us well versus our competition, increased competition could result in loss of market share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing, and increased sales and marketing expenditures.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. We have policies related to confidentiality, ownership, and the use and protection of Gartner’s intellectual property. We also enter into agreements with our employees as appropriate that protect our intellectual property, and we enforce these agreements if necessary. We recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify, create and protect it. Additionally, we actively monitor and enforce contract compliance by
our end users. 
EMPLOYEES 

We had a total of 15,173 employees as of December 31, 2018, a slight increase compared to 15,131 at December 31, 2017. The 15,173 employees at December 31, 2018 is net of a reduction of 1,547 employees resulting from our 2018 business divestitures. Adjusting for these divestitures, our total headcount increased by approximately 11% year-over-year. 
We had 8,802 employees, or 58% of our total employees, based in the U.S. at December 31, 2018 in 83 offices. We had 1,312 employees located at our headquarters facility in Stamford, Connecticut and nearby; 1,930 employees located at our Ft. Myers,

Our employees may be subject to collective bargaining agreements at a company or industry level, or works councils, in those foreign countries where this is part of the local labor law or practice. We have experienced no work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be favorable.
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
Our U.S. government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the U.S. Congress to fund the agencies contracting for our products and services. Additionally, our contracts at the state and local levels, as well as foreign government contracts, are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms.
