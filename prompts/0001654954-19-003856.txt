BUSINESS

 
  Overview
  
 TOMI Environmental Solutions, Inc. (“TOMI”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us”) is a global company that specializes in disinfection and decontamination essentials using its premier Binary Ionization Technology® (“BIT™”)platform through the manufacturing, licensing, servicing, and selling of its SteraMist® brand of products. SteraMist is a hydrogen peroxide-based mist/fog registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) as a hospital-healthcare and effective broad-spectrum surface disinfectant. Our operating structure consists of four divisions: Hospital-HealthCare, Life Sciences, TOMI Service Network (“TSN®”) and Food Safety. We provide environmental solutions for indoor and outdoor surface and air decontamination. Our mission is to help create a healthier world through the implementation and integration of our state-of-the-art product line and set of services, remaining committed to our motto, Innovating for a Safer World®.
  
 TOMI introduced SteraMist® to the commercial market in June 2013. In June 2015, we successfully registered SteraMist® BIT™ as a hospital-healthcare disinfectant for use as a misting/fogging agent, at which time it became the first EPA-registered hospital-healthcare and general disinfectant registered solution and technology disinfection system on the market.
  
 We have expanded our SteraMist® BIT™ Technology beyond the initial chemical and biological warfare applications to the killing of problem and resistant microorganisms, including spores, in a wide variety of commercial settings. SteraMist® BIT™ is designed to provide fast-acting biological six-log kill (a 99.9999% kill) in even the hardest-to-reach areas, while leaving no residue or noxious fumes.
  
 We currently disinfect and decontaminate a variety of large and small indoor spaces threatened and thought to be threatened by biological pathogens and chemical agents for our domestic and international target markets. SteraMist® is used in the control of the spread of microorganisms and infectious diseases in a variety of use sites under our four (4) divisions, including hospitals, healthcare facilities (acute & chronic care), bio-safety labs of all levels including the most stringent BSL-3 and BSL-4, pharmaceutical (compounding and manufacturing), biodefense, isolation and transfer chambers, bio-safety cabinets (BSCs), food safety and other commercial and residential settings.
  
 We believe we have the potential to become the industry standard in the prevention of transference and the overall solution for the concern regarding the level of healthcare acquired infections around the world, the impact of increased regulatory inspection of cleaning and validation processes for both pharmaceutical and food processing facilities, and the increased concern of bacterial, viral and mold infections that affects our industries, functionality, and communities’ everyday living.

  Our Technology
  
 BIT™ was developed in response to Amerithrax, the weaponized anthrax spore attacks that occurred in Washington, D.C. shortly after the September 11, 2001 U.S. terrorist attacks. BIT™ is a patented process that aerosolizes and activates a low concentration hydrogen peroxide solution, producing a fine aqueous mist (0.5-3 um in diameter) that contains a high concentration of Reactive Oxidative Species (“ROS”), mostly hydroxyl radicals (“.OH”). ROS cause damage to pathogenic and resistant organisms, such as bacteria, bacteria spores, viruses, mold spores, other fungi and yeast, via oxidation of proteins carbohydrates, lipids and rendering the building blocks of nature- amino acids, DNA and RNA inactive - leading to cellular death, disruption and/or dysfunction.
  
 Testing detailed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense demonstrates these hydroxyl radicals, aggressively break the double bonds and other bonds in bacterial spores, biological and chemical warfare agents and neutralize their threat while producing nontoxic by-products. The unique alteration of the chemistry of our solution occurs after our EPA-registered solution passes through a high-energy-atmospheric cold plasma arc, which causes the breaking of the double bond of a hydrogen peroxide molecule, the net result - our .OH hydroxyl radical. This hydroxyl radical is known as Ionized Hydrogen Peroxide (“iHP™”). This patented process allows these hydroxyl radicals to exist in high concentrations without rapidly recombining and losing their reactivity, while seeking to attach with any and all surfaces within the proximity of TOMI’s mist.
  
 The sole active ingredient of BIT™ is a low percentage (7.8%) Hydrogen Peroxide and is represented by the TOMI™ SteraMist® brand of products. Our technology produces a germ-killing aerosol that moves throughout a space like a gas. Our technology is able to efficiently and effectively kill pathogenic and resistant organisms in the air and on the surfaces without damaging delicate equipment or computers, and the only by-product is oxygen and water in the form of humidity. SteraMist® is designed to be easily incorporated into any industry’s current cleaning procedures; is economical, non-corrosive and easy to apply; leaves behind no residues; and requires no manual wiping.
  
 Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), we are required to register with the EPA and certain state regulatory authorities as a seller of pesticides. In June 2015, SteraMist® BIT™ was registered with the EPA as a hospital-healthcare disinfectant and general broad-spectrum surface disinfectant for use as a misting/fogging agent. SteraMist® BIT™ now holds EPA registrations (# 90150-2) for mold control, and air and surface remediation (# 90150-1). In February 2016, we expanded our label with the EPA to include C. diff spores and MRSA, as well as the influenza virus h1n1, which we believe has better positioned us to penetrate all industries including the bio-defense and healthcare industry. In August 2017, our EPA label was further expanded to include efficacy against Salmonella and Norovirus. As of January 27, 2017, our technology is one of 53 of the EPA’s “Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective against Clostridium difficile Spores”, as published on the EPA’s K List. Further, in December 2017, SteraMist® was included in the EPA’s list G (Norovirus), L (Ebola) and M (Avian Flu). Currently, our EPA-registered label in all fifty (50) U.S. states as well as many other countries.
  
 SteraMist® is being used throughout the world and has been demonstrated to reduce certain problem organisms, such as bacterial spores, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (“VRE”), Clostridium difficile spores (“C. diff”), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (“MERS”) and Ebola Virus Disease (“Ebola”). In U.S. hospitals where SteraMist® is being used for terminal cleaning, evidence has demonstrated a reduction of C. diff spore rates. SteraMist® has reduced outbreaks of nosocomial MDRO’s (Klebsiella pneumoniae, AB, pseudomonas aeruginosa) at large hospital to small clinics and has contributed to the control of MERS and Ebola throughout the world.
  
 Our technology passed a sanctioned test showing six-log reduction against Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Geobacillus stearothermophilus is the laboratory testing gold standard and is commonly used as a challenge organism for sterilization validation studies and periodic check of sterilization cycles. In May 2015, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) awarded us a grant in the amount of $559,000 for the development of SteraMist™ Mobile Decontamination Chambers to fight Ebola. In May 2016, upon the decontamination and decommissioning of an Ebola treatment center in West Africa, we fully achieved the milestones upon which the grant was conditioned. Additionally, BIT™ has also been shown to effectively decontaminate weaponized biological agents, including anthrax, chemical agents such as VX (an extremely toxic organophosphate) and sulfur mustard (otherwise known as mustard gas) when applied using properly developed international protocols.
  
 All our SteraMist® products are fully validated to comply with good manufacturing practice standards, have received Conformité Européene (“CE”) marks in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and are approved by Underwriters Laboratory (“UL”). Our solution is manufactured at an EPA-registered solution blender and our product performance is supported by good laboratory practice efficacy data for Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, Norovirus, mold spores, MRSA, h1n1, Geobacillus stearothermophilus and C. diff spores.

 Life Sciences. Our SteraMist® line of products is a decontamination solution to use sites in this industry, specifically pharmaceutical (compounding and manufacturing), vivariums, research universities, BSLs of any level, BSC’s, chambers, isolators, cage washers, and cleanrooms. With proper implementation SteraMist® can reduce the risk of infectious as well as potentially infectious agents and/or materials, facilities such as these handle on a routine basis.
  
 There are many requirements and restrictions on the type of decontamination agents our Life Sciences customers may use to prevent these risks and remediate adverse incidents. In light of these regulations, our rapid deployment of our effective ionized hydrogen peroxide aerosolized mist is the solution to lower risks, reduce damage to expensive laboratory equipment and furniture, eliminate other labor intense procedures, and perform decontamination clean-up in these spaces quickly, less caustically, requiring no wipe and with no residue.
 
 Our team of technicians and representatives train, maintain, and troubleshoot capital equipment globally for our Life Sciences customers. Further, our iHP™ service decontamination team provides routine, emergency, and/or commissioning or decommissioning of facilities equipment or full complete space decontamination for its customer base.
  
 Hospital-HealthCare. Our SteraMist® line of products, specifically the SteraMist® Surface Unit and EZ SteraMist Disinfection Cart are solutions to aid our Hospital-HealthCare customers in providing the quality of care and safety they provide to their patients by disinfecting patient and operating rooms, pharmacies, ambulances, and emergency environments in a hospital or healthcare facility. Our team of technicians and representatives train, maintain, and troubleshoot capital equipment throughout the world for our Hospital-HealthCare customers.
  
 We continue to penetrate the hospital-healthcare market segment, and under the United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (also known as the Affordable Care Act or ACA) Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, hospitals that have high rates of infections and HAIs are facing significant financial penalties. Our SteraMist® BIT™ technology has proven to reduce the transference spread of infections leading to an overall reduction in the number of patients being infected as a result of the prior poor manual cleaning of these patient rooms, infectious disease rooms and operatory suites, with a corresponding return on investment to the hospital of up to 20-to-1 in the first year. At this time, we cannot predict the effect of any potential healthcare reform legislation, including the potential repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, on such penalties.
  
 The TOMI Service Network. The TSN, has allowed us to enhance our corporate service division by creating a multi-nation-wide network composed of existing, full-service specialists. Since the launch of TSN, we have recruited and entered into eighty-eight (88) licensing agreements across the United States and Canada. These are professional leaders and first responders that specialize within the mold remediation and mitigation fields, bio-safety and biohazard specialists including forensic restoration specialists. These servicing specialists focus their businesses in the commercial and residential space. Our team of TSN Business Managers and SteraMist® technicians train, maintain and troubleshoot capital equipment for these individuals with the goal of implementing servicing procedures and protocols throughout the United States and Canada for our TSN network members.
  
  In September 2018, we partnered with the Global BioRisk Advisory Council (“GBAC”) to use SteraMist® as one of the training technologies used in their certification classes. This also allows for the decontamination of everyday crises as well as forensic restoration and bio-hazard scenes as needed. TOMI also launched the Forensic Restoration Service Team (or “FRST”), a U.S. based TOMI-certified forensic restoration and crime clean network. This network is comprised of service providers who specialize in forensic restoration such as mass casualty, crime scene, suicide and unattended death cleanup. Also included within this field are hoarding and bio-recovery services. Participating FRST members will receive specialized training and certifications by GBAC. We have four (4) certified FRST members to date.
  
 Food Safety Industry. SteraMist™ is an effective decontaminant in the food safety industry. According to the CDC, 80 million people per year in the United States contract, and 5,000 people die from, food poisoning or other food-related illnesses. Current food safety cleaning techniques involve time intensive processes, which can reduce food manufacturers’ profit. Our iHP™ degrades into only harmless water and oxygen. After we obtain approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), we anticipate that our solution can be applied directly to all foods. Currently we use SteraMist on all food packing and storage equipment as SteraMist® is safe for use on electronics and kitchenware, along with high touch surfaces where most pathogens are found (such as phones, computers and kitchen appliances). We believe that SteraMist® could be useful for decontamination at all phases of food production, from the farm, slaughterhouse, packaging and canning facilities, food storage locations to the transportation of food and to the restaurants and grocery stores.
  
 Medical Cannabis. TOMI is looking to enter the global medical and recreational cannabis market. Currently we are researching how the BIT Solution and the iHP process can be used to rid the cannabis plant of the following:
  
 - Powdery Mildew (odium, white mold)
  - Spider Mites, Thrips, Root Aphids & Fungus Gnats
  - Bud Rot (Botrytis cinerea)
  - Load counts on coliform, microbes, bacteria, e. coli and other molds. 
  - Direct plant application, soil application and whole room application
  - Residuals left on the plant

  All tests will also include whether or not the process affects the THC and Cannabinoid levels of the plant.
  
 SteraMist® can be used in cannabis facilities globally upping the industry standard of disinfecting areas between grows. For example, the cannabis drying/curing/cloning/grow rooms, manufacturing/packaging areas, on-site laboratories, storage rooms, and employee restrooms and locker rooms. According to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce analysts forecast the projected 2019 sale of both medical and recreational cannabis in North America is currently being estimated to reach $7 billion in Canada and $4.5 billion in the United States, with the expectation of the U.S. market doubling the Canadian market in sales if a full federal legalization is passed by 2020.
  
 Homeland Defense and Border Protection. Countries around the world, including the United States, need to protect their borders and cities against a potential terrorist attack. Our SteraMist® line of products will give governmental bodies an added tool in their arsenal to mitigate the risk of a weaponized biological attack. In addition, SteraMist® could assist in mitigating the spread of emerging pandemic viruses, including strains of Ebola, MERS, MLAV, h1n1, h5n1, h7n9 and h10n8. Our SteraMist® line of products may assist border patrol agents in controlling the spread of infectious disease introduced by foreign individuals by decontaminating interview rooms, containment rooms, holding cells and quarantine areas after a potential infected carrier’s condition either improves or the carrier dies.

Internationally, our products are sold through exclusive and non-exclusive sales representatives and distributors. We have shipped our equipment and solution into twenty (20) countries worldwide.
  
  Competition
  
 The decontamination and environmental infectious disease control industry is extremely competitive and highly regulated. Competition is intense in all four (4) of our divisions and includes many large and small competitors.
  
 Our competitors include companies that market other hydrogen peroxide-based products, such as Steris Corporation (“Steris”), Bioquell, Inc. (“Bioquell”) and The Clorox Company (“Clorox”), various ultraviolet companies and quad ammonia-chemical companies. We believe our SteraMist suite of products have a competitive advantage in that they have a quicker and less caustic kill time, provide a six log kill to a wide variety of pathogens and leave no residue or unpleasant odor. However, these competitors may have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger installed customer bases and substantially greater financial and marketing resources than us.
  
 We believe that the principal factors affecting competition in our markets include name recognition and the ability to receive referrals based on client confidence in the service. There are no significant barriers of entry that could keep potential competitors from opening similar facilities. Our ability to compete successfully in the industry will depend, in large part, upon our ability to market and sell our indoor decontamination and infectious disease control products and services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in this industry, or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
  
 We believe that our growth in these industries as a leading global disinfection/decontamination company depends on our abilities to discover, develop, market, and innovate, disruptive cost-effective products and services.
  
  Competitive Advantages
  
  We believe the SteraMist® technology has many competitive advantages over its competition. Our technology can turn over a space to an end-user far faster than its competition. Our technology requires limited preparation to an area compared to our competitors and does not rely on fans to move throughout a space.
