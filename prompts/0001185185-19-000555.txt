ITEM 1. Business
Our History
 
We (or “IVFH”) (or the “Company”) were initially formed in June 1979 as Alpha Solarco Inc., a Colorado corporation. From June 1979 through February 2003, we were either inactive or involved in discontinued business ventures. We changed our name to Fiber Application Systems Technology, Ltd in February 2003. In January 2004, we changed our state of incorporation by merging into Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. (IVFH), a Florida corporation formed for that purpose. As a result of the merger, we changed our name to that of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. In January 2004, we also acquired Food Innovations, Inc. (“FII” or “Food Innovations”), a Florida corporation, for 500,000 shares of our common stock.
 
On May 18, 2012, the Company executed a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Artisan Specialty Foods, Inc., an Illinois corporation (“Artisan”), from its owner, Mr. David Vohaska.  The purchase price was $1.2 million, with up to another $300,000 (with a fair value of $131,000) payable in the event certain financial milestones are met over the next one or two years. Those milestones have been met. 
 
On November 2, 2012, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Haley Acquisition”) with The Haley Group, LLC whereby we acquired all existing assets of The Haley Group, LLC and its customers. The Haley Acquisition was valued at a total cost of $119,645.

There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations.
 
Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of January 1, 2017 the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Oasis Sales Corp. (“Oasis”), purchased substantially all of the assets of Oasis Sales and Marketing, L.L.C. for $300,000 cash;  a $200,000 structured equity instrument   which can be paid in cash or shares of the Company stock at the Company’s option, anytime under certain conditions, or is automatically payable via the issuance of 200,000 shares if the Company’s shares close above $1.00 for ten consecutive days; a $100,000 note;  and up to an additional $400,000 in earn-outs over two years if certain milestones are met.  The Agreement also contains claw-back provisions if certain revenue conditions are not met. The milestones have been met.
 
Effective January 24, 2018, pursuant to an asset acquisition agreement, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Innovative Gourmet LLC (“Innovative Gourmet”), acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of iGourmet LLC and iGourmet NY LLC, privately-held New York limited liability companies located in West Pittston, Pennsylvania  (collectively, “Sellers”) engaged in the sale, marketing, and distribution of specialty food and specialty food items through www.igourmet.com, online marketplaces, additional  direct-to-consumer platforms, distribution to foodservice, retail stores and other wholesale accounts, pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement.

Relationship with U.S. Foods
 
We have historically sold the majority of our products, $30,386,189 and $29,854,522 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively 57% of total sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 and 72% of total sales in the year ended December 31, 2017), through a distributor relationship between FII, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries of U.S. Foods, a leading broadline distributor. On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract directly between FII and U.S. Foods (the “U.S. Foods Agreement”).  The term of the U.S. Foods Agreement was from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provided for a limited number of automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days’ notice of its intent not to renew. Based on the terms, the U.S. Foods Agreement was extended through December 31, 2018. Effective January 1, 2018 the U.S. Foods Agreement was further amended to remove the cap on renewals, and provide for an unlimited number of additional 12-month terms unless either party notifies the other in writing, 30 days prior to the end date, of its intent not to renew.
Growth Strategy
 
While the U.S. economic recovery remains uncertain there appears to be much opportunity for the specialty food industry . Amidst efforts to increase overall efficiency and success, the specialty food industry has experienced general growth in sales through manufacture, retail, and distribution.  According to the State of the Specialty Food Industry report completed by the Specialty Food Association and Mintel in 2018, specialty food sales hit $140 billion in the U.S. in 2017. In addition, specialty food sales growth on the retail level was 12.9% vs 1.4% traditional food sales growth.  Moreover, product innovation and wider availability of specialty food continued to pay a part in the growth of the space.
 
Furthermore, smaller genuine brands or specialty brands continue to resonate with consumer and according to a recent Credit Suisse report, the combined market share of the 20 largest packaged food companies fell to 42.4% in 2018 from 46.8% in 2011. That same report indicated that 70% of the top 20 selling foods on Amazon.com were created by startups which is a further demonstration of the continuing shift towards unique higher quality specialty food items.
 
In addition, according to Mintel, online specialty food sales grew by 20.9% from 2015 to 2017 as consumers continue to shift their food buying patterns towards ecommerce as offerings continue to expand. We anticipate the opportunity to capitalize on those shifts in consumer purchasing and our ecommerce efforts will continue to focus on the niche, specialty and premium areas of the food ecommerce market as opposed to the everyday grocery needs.
 
For our continued growth within the specialty food space, we will continue to offer unique and premium quality products as well as new product introduction and innovation to our customers and potential customers. In addition, we plan on continuing to value and strive for a high level of personalized customer service.
 
We anticipate attempting to grow our business through:
 

- | Increased ecommerce conversion rates by improving the shopping experience on our website.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Growth in the number of unique visitors to our various ecommerce sites.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Maximize sales of current product catalog to our existing customers and potential new customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Introduction of new products to both our ecommerce and foodservice customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Expansion of availability of branded products and new brands which are consistent with the changing demands of customers in the U.S.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Leveraging Igourmet.com toward further expansion of our sales and distribution channels either organically or through acquisition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Leveraging our platform to partner with both foodservice and other consumer oriented entities such as stores and celebrity brands, to offer unique product offerings related to specialty food and specialty food gifting.

In addition to attempting to grow our current business, we believe that there are lateral opportunities in the food industry. We may consider the possibility of acquiring specialty food manufacturers, specialty food distributors, small specialty food brands, or specialty food e-commerce businesses, at some future point in time. We anticipate that, given our current cash flow levels, any acquisition could potentially involve the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or third party financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms. No acquisition will be consummated without thorough due diligence. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify and successfully conclude negotiations with any potential target.
 
General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food-prepared-away-from-home and, in turn, can impact our customers and our sales. We believe the current general economic conditions, including pressure on consumer disposable income, may contribute to a slow or declining growth in the overall broadline foodservice market but toward growth in the specialty foodservice and specialty CPG market.  We intend to continue our efforts to expand our market share and grow earnings by focusing on sales growth, margin management, expansion of distribution channels, productivity gains and supply chain management, and product and service differentiation.
 
Competition
 
While we face intense competition in the marketing of our products and services, it is our belief that there are few companies, that offers such a broad range of customer service oriented, quality, chef driven products and specialty gourmet products, for delivery from same day to 72 hours.  Our primary competition is from local purveyors that supply a limited local market and have a limited range of products and from the other specialty gourmet distributors and specialty food retail stores or ecommerce stores, and from the national, regional or local expansion of specialty and non-specialty food distributers and food stores and food focused ecommerce sites. In addition, many purveyors are well established, have reputations for success in the development and marketing of these types of products and services and have significantly greater financial, marketing, distribution, personnel and other resources. These financial and other capabilities permit such companies to implement extensive advertising and promotional campaigns, both generally and in response to efforts by additional competitors such as us, to enter into new markets and introduce new products and services.
Insurance
 
We maintain a general liability insurance policy with a per occurrence limit of $1,000,000 and aggregate policy covering $2,000,000 of liability for all entities except Innovative Gourmet, which carries a general liability insurance policy with a per occurrence limit of $2,000,000 and aggregate policy covering $4,000,000 of liability. All entities carry non-owned automobile bodily injury and property damage coverage with a limit of $1,000,000. The Company also carries an Umbrella policy of up to $10,000,000 which covers all entities except Artisan and Innovative Gourmet; Artisan carries a separate Umbrella policy of up to $5,000,000; Innovative Gourmet carries a separate Umbrella policy of up to $4,000,000; and Innovative Gourmet carries a separate Cyber policy of up to $2,000,000. Such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential claims against us and additional insurance may not be available in the future at a reasonable price
Government Regulation
 
Various federal and state laws currently exist, and more are sure to be adopted, regulating the delivery of fresh food products. We require specialty foodservice third-party vendors to certify that they maintain at least $3,000,000 liability insurance coverage and compliance with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP), an FDA- and USDA-mandated food safety program, or a similar standard. Any changes in the government regulation of delivering of fresh food products that hinders our current ability and/or cost to deliver fresh products, could adversely impact our net revenues and gross margins and, therefore, our profitability and cash flows could also be adversely affected.
Employees
 
We currently employ 112 full-time employees, including 8 chefs and 1 executive officer. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. None of our employees are represented by a union.
Transactions with Major Customers
 
Transactions with a major customer and related economic dependence information is set forth (1) following our discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, (2) Under the heading Major Customer in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, (3) in Business – Relationship with U.S. Foods, (4) as the second item under Risk Factors.
