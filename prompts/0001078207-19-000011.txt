Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
Founded in 1986, Nautilus, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, "Nautilus" or the "Company") is a consumer fitness products company headquartered in Vancouver, Washington and incorporated in the State of Washington in January 1993. We are committed to providing innovative, quality solutions to help people achieve their fitness goals through a fit and healthy lifestyle. Our principal business activities include designing, developing, sourcing and marketing high-quality cardio and strength fitness products and related accessories for consumer and commercial use, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, but also in international markets outside North America. Our products are sold under some of the most-recognized brand names in the fitness industry: Nautilus®, Bowflex®, Octane Fitness®, Schwinn® and Universal®.
We market our products through two distinct distribution channels, Direct and Retail, which we consider to be separate business segments. Our Direct business offers products directly to consumers through television advertising, the Internet and catalogs. Our Retail business offers our products through a network of independent companies to reach consumers in both the home use, as well as commercial use, markets in the U.S. and internationally. We also derive a portion of our revenue from the licensing of our brands and intellectual property.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
We are focused on developing and marketing consumer fitness equipment and related products to help people enjoy healthier lives. Our products are targeted to meet the needs of a broad range of consumers, including fitness enthusiasts and individuals who are seeking the benefits of regular exercise. We have diversified our business by expanding our portfolio of high quality fitness equipment into multiple product lines utilizing our well-recognized brand names. We are focused on consumer markets and specialty and commercial distribution channels, and view the continual innovation of our product offerings as a key aspect of our business strategy. We regularly refresh our existing product lines with new technologies and finishes, and focus significant effort and resources on the development or acquisition of innovative new fitness products and technologies for introduction to the marketplace at periodic intervals.

Our strategies incorporate the individual characteristics of our Direct and Retail businesses. Our Direct business focuses on: (i) the development of, or acquisition of rights to, unique, branded products and technologies; (ii) the application of creative, cost-effective ways to communicate the benefits of their use; and (iii) making various payment options available to our customers. We are particularly attentive to Direct business metrics that provide feedback regarding the effectiveness of our media marketing programs and attractiveness of third-party consumer financing programs. 
In our Retail business, we strive to develop long-term relationships with key retailers of sports or fitness equipment. The primary objectives of our Retail business are (i) to offer a selection of innovative, unique products at key price-points to capture market share; and (ii) to utilize the strength of our brands and long-standing customer relationships to secure more floor space with our Retail customers for our products, as well as support efforts to gain share in multi-user environments.
Our long-term strategy involves:

• | Creatively marketing our equipment, both directly to consumers and through our Retail customers, while leveraging our well-known brand names;


• | Enhancing our product lines by designing fitness equipment that meets or exceeds the high expectations of our customers;


• | Utilizing our strengths in product engineering to reduce product costs;


• | Continuing our investment in research and development activities aimed at acquiring or creating new technologies;


• | Increasing our international Retail sales and distribution; and


• | Maximizing available royalty revenues from the licensing of our brands and intellectual property.

PRODUCTS
We market quality cardiovascular and strength fitness products that cover a broad range of price points and features. Our products are designed for home use and multi-user environments by individuals with varying exercise needs. From the person who works out occasionally to the serious athlete, we have products that will help them achieve their fitness objectives.

• | Nautilus® is our corporate umbrella brand and is also used to differentiate certain specialized cardio, treadmills, ellipticals and bike products.


• | Our Bowflex® brand represents a highly-regarded line of fitness equipment comprised of both cardio and strength products, including the Max Trainer®, TreadClimber®, HVT® and LateralX® specialized cardio machines, PowerRod® and Revolution® home gyms and SelectTech® dumbbells. 


• | Our Octane Fitness® brand is known for its innovation around low-impact cardio products, including the perfection of the traditional elliptical machine, along with the creation of new categories of exercise, including the xRide® recumbent elliptical, the LateralX® elliptical, and the Zero Runner®. 


• | Our Schwinn® brand is known for its popular line of exercise bikes, including the Airdyne®, as well as Schwinn-branded treadmills and ellipticals.


• | Our Universal® brand, one of the oldest and most recognized names in the fitness industry, currently offers a line of weight benches.


We generally differentiate the product models offered in our Direct and Retail sales channels. We typically introduce innovative products in our Direct sales channel and build awareness through our traditional and digital media spending, and then look to cascade these into the Retail channels. We also have specific products targeted for commercial-grade requirements.
Approximately 82% of our revenue in 2018 was derived from sales of consumer cardio products. While we continue to be a leader in the consumer strength product category, we believe the much larger market for cardio products offers us greater opportunity for growth.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
We conduct our business in two segments, Direct and Retail. For further information regarding our segments and geographic information, see Note 21, Segment and Enterprise-Wide Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
SALES AND MARKETING
Direct
In our Direct business, we market and sell our products, principally Bowflex® cardio and strength products, directly to consumers. While we are, and plan to continue to be, a large direct marketer of strength products in the U.S., our advertising emphasis has shifted toward cardio products, especially the Max Trainer®, HVT® and LateralX®, as cardio products represent the largest component of the fitness equipment market and a majority of our business. Sales of cardio products represented 87% of our Direct channel revenues in 2018, compared to 90% and 93% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Our marketing efforts are based on an integrated combination of media and direct consumer contact. In addition to television advertising, which ranges in length from 30 seconds to as long as three minutes, we utilize Internet advertising, product websites, inquiry-response mailings, catalogs and inbound/outbound call centers. Marketing and media effectiveness is measured 
continuously based on sales inquiries generated, cost-per-lead, conversion rates, return on investment and other performance metrics and we strive to optimize the efficiency of our marketing and media expenditures based on this data. Almost all of our Direct customer orders are received either on our Internet websites or through company-owned and third-party call centers.
In order to facilitate consumer sales, we partner with several third-party credit providers. Credit approval rates are an important variable in the number of Direct products we sell in a given period. Combined consumer credit approvals by our primary and secondary U.S. third-party financing providers increased to 55% in 2018 from 54% in 2017 and 51% in 2016. The year-over-year increase in approval rates for 2018 compared to 2017 reflects a continued strong consumer credit environment. The increase in approval rates for 2017 versus 2016 was due to expansion of credit approval standards, primarily by our Tier 1 third-party credit provider.
Retail
In our Retail business, we market and sell a comprehensive line of consumer fitness equipment under the Nautilus®, Octane Fitness®, Schwinn®, Universal® and Bowflex® brands. Our products are marketed through a network of retail companies, consisting of sporting goods stores, Internet retailers, large-format and warehouse stores, smaller specialty retailers, independent bike dealers, and to specialty commercial customers purchasing our products for multi-user environments.
We offer programs that provide price discounts to our Retail customers for ordering container-sized shipments or placing orders early enough in the season to allow for more efficient manufacturing by our Asian suppliers. These programs are designed to reduce our shipping and handling costs, with much of the savings being passed on to our customers. In addition, we often offer other types of sales incentives to our Retail customers, including volume discounts and various forms of rebates or allowances, which generally are intended to increase product exposure and availability for consumers, reduce transportation costs, and encourage marketing and promotion of our brands or specific products.
PRODUCT DESIGN AND INNOVATION 
Innovation is a vital part of our business, and we continue to expand and diversify our product offerings by leveraging our research and development capabilities. We constantly search for new technologies and innovations that will help us grow our business, either through higher sales or increased production efficiencies. To accomplish this objective, we seek out ideas and concepts both within our company and from outside inventors.
We rely on financial and engineering models to assist us in assessing the potential operational and economic impacts of adopting new technologies and innovations. If we determine that a third-party technology or innovation concept meets certain technical and financial criteria, we may enter into a licensing arrangement to utilize the technology or, in certain circumstances, purchase the technology for our own use. Our product design and engineering teams also invest considerable effort to improve product design and quality. As a consumer-driven company, we invest from time-to-time in qualitative and quantitative consumer research to help us assess new product concepts, optimal features and anticipated consumer adoption.
Our research and development expenses were $16.8 million, $15.4 million and $13.9 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as we increased our investment in new product development resources and capabilities. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in 2019 as we continue to supplement our investment in new product development, technology initiatives, and engineering capabilities.
SEASONALITY
We expect our revenue from fitness equipment products to vary seasonally. Sales are typically strongest in the first and fourth quarters, followed by the third quarter, and are generally weakest in the second quarter. We believe that consumers tend to be involved in outdoor activities during the spring and summer months, including outdoor exercise, which impacts sales of indoor fitness equipment. This seasonality can have a significant effect on our inventory levels, working capital needs and resource utilization.
MERCHANDISE SOURCING 
All of our products are produced by third-party manufacturers, and, in 2018, our manufacturing partners were primarily located in Asia. Although multiple factories bid on and are able to produce most of our products, we typically select one factory to be the primary supplier of any given product. Lead times for inventory purchases from our Asian suppliers, from order placement to receipt of goods, generally range from approximately two to three months, of which transit time represents three-to-four weeks. The length of our lead times requires us to place advance manufacturing orders based on management forecasts of future demand 
for our products. We attempt to compensate for our long replenishment lead times by maintaining adequate levels of inventory at our warehousing facilities.
We monitor our suppliers' ability to meet our product needs and we participate in quality assurance activities to reinforce adherence to our quality standards. Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter duration, or manufactured products are sourced on the basis of individual purchase orders. Our manufacturing relationships are non-exclusive, and we are permitted to procure our products from other sources at our discretion. None of our manufacturing contracts include production volume or purchase commitments on the part of either party. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the sourcing of raw materials and producing parts and finished products to our specifications.
LOGISTICS
Our warehousing and distribution facilities are located in Oregon and Ohio. In addition to Company-operated distribution centers, we utilize third-party warehouses and logistics providers to fulfill orders. 
In our Direct business we strive to maintain inventory levels that will allow us to ship our products shortly after receiving a customer's order. We use common carriers for substantially all of our merchandise shipments to Direct customers.
In our Retail business we manage our inventory levels to accommodate anticipated seasonal changes in demand. Generally, we maintain higher inventory levels at the end of the third and fourth quarters to satisfy relatively higher consumer demand in the fourth and first quarters of each year. Many of our Retail customers place orders well in advance of peak periods of consumer demand to ensure an adequate supply for the anticipated selling season. 
In 2018, approximately 58% of our Retail customers' orders were shipped by our contract manufacturers in Asia directly to our Retail customers locations, typically in container loads. The use of such direct shipments allows us to maintain lower levels of inventory in our warehouses, resulting in lower storage, handling, freight, insurance and other costs, with much of the savings being passed on to our customers. We use various commercial truck lines for our merchandise shipments to Retail customers.
COMPETITION
The markets for all of our products are highly competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors affecting our business are quality, brand recognition, innovation and pricing. We believe we are well positioned to compete in markets in which we can take advantage of our strong brand names, and that our focus on innovative product design, quality, and performance distinguishes our products from the competition.
Our products compete directly with those offered by a large number of companies that market consumer fitness equipment and fitness programs. As the use of Internet websites for product sales by traditional retailers has increased, our competitors have become increasingly similar across our Direct and Retail sales channels.
Our principal competitors include: ICON Health & Fitness, Johnson Health Tech, Peloton, Beach Body, American Telecast, Life Fitness, Precor and Technogym. We also compete with marketers of mobile device applications focused on fitness training and coaching on both iOS® and Android™ platforms, such as Workout: Gym exercise planner and NIKE® Training Club. Additional marketers of competitive products include the following: activity trackers and content-driven physical activity products, such as Fitbit® and Garmin vivofit®; computer-based recreation products, such as the Microsoft Xbox®; weight management companies, such as Weight Watchers® and Nutrisystem®; group fitness, such as cross-fit classes; and gym memberships, each of which offers alternative solutions for a fit and healthy lifestyle.
EMPLOYEES
As of February 22, 2019, we had approximately 460 employees, substantially all of whom were full-time. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced a material interruption of our operations due to labor disputes.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Trademarks, patents and other forms of intellectual property are vital to the success of our business and are an essential factor in maintaining our competitive position in the health and fitness industry. We regularly monitor commercial activity in our industry to identify potential infringement of our intellectual property. We protect our proprietary rights and take prompt, reasonable actions to prevent counterfeit products and other infringement on our intellectual property.
Trademarks
We own many trademarks, including Nautilus®, Bowflex®, Max Trainer®, TreadClimber®, HVT®, Power Rod®, Bowflex Revolution®, SelectTech®, Octane Fitness®, LateralX®, xRide®, Zero Runner®, Airdyne®, Universal®, RunSocial®, and Max IntelligenceTM. Nautilus is the exclusive licensee under the Schwinn® mark for indoor fitness products. We believe that having distinctive trademarks that are readily identifiable by consumers is an important factor in creating a market for our products, maintaining a strong company identity and developing brand loyalty among our customers. In addition, we have granted licenses to a third party to use the Nautilus, Schwinn and TreadClimber trademarks on commercial fitness products, for which we receive royalty income and expanded consumer awareness of our brands.
Each federally registered trademark is renewable indefinitely if the trademark is still in use at the time of renewal.
Patents and Designs
Building our intellectual property portfolio is an important factor in maintaining our competitive position in the health and fitness equipment industry. We have followed a policy of filing applications for U.S. and non-U.S. patents on utility and design inventions that we deem valuable to our business.
We own or license patents and design registrations covering a variety of technologies, some of which are utilized in our selectorized dumbbells, treadmills, exercise bikes, and elliptical machines. Patent and design protection for these technologies, which are utilized in products sold in both the Direct and Retail segments, extends as far as 2034.
We maintain a portfolio of patents related to our TreadClimber® specialized cardio machines, which are sold primarily in our Direct segment. The portfolio includes patents with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2027. 
We maintain a portfolio of patents and patent applications related to our MaxTrainer® specialized cardio machines, which are sold in our Direct and Retail segments. The portfolio includes issued patents with expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2034, and additional pending patent applications.
Nautilus is also the licensee of patents related to the Bowflex Revolution® home gyms. These patents have expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2025. Through its Octane Fitness subsidiary, Nautilus owns and licenses certain patents related to Octane's LateralX®, xRide® and Zero Runner® products. These patents have expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2034.
BACKLOG
We define our customer order backlog to include firm orders for future shipment to our Retail customers, as well as unfulfilled consumer orders within the Direct segment. 
Backlog as of a given date fluctuates based on specific timing of product shipment within the typical shipment timeframes for each of our segments. Retail orders comprise the larger portion of our order backlog, while Direct orders comprise a smaller portion of our backlog due to shorter fulfillment timeframes. 
Our customer order backlog as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $2.9 million and $6.0 million, respectively. 
SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, Amazon.com and Dick's Sporting Goods accounted for more than 10% of total net sales as follows:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Amazon.com | 11.5 | % | | 11.9 | % | 11.4 | %
Dick's Sporting Goods | 13.8 | % | | * | | * | 

*Less than 10% of total net sales.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS
Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations both domestically and abroad. In the U.S., federal, state and local regulations impose standards on our workplace and our relationship with the environment. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that may impact our operations. In particular, we are subject to legislation placing restrictions on our generation, emission, treatment, storage and disposal of materials, substances and wastes. Such legislation includes: the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response and the Compensation and Liability Act (also known as Superfund). We are also subject to the requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, in addition to regulations concerning employee health and safety matters. 
Our operations and certain disposed components of our former Commercial business expose us to claims related to environmental matters. Although compliance with federal, state, local and international environmental legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cash flows in the past, there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such environmental matters in the future.
Our digital platforms may receive, process, transmit and store personal health and fitness information relating to identifiable individuals. Consumer demand for personalized fitness experiences, through mobile applications or wearable fitness trackers and our focus on digital fitness solutions for our products may increase the volume of identifiable individual information we receive on our platforms and through our products. We also receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals in our capacity as an employer. As a result, we may be subject to numerous United States (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect both individually identifiable information as well as personal health information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”) and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), each of which governs, among other things, the privacy, security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information. The GDPR includes, and a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies elsewhere in the world have adopted, consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. These breach notification laws continue to evolve and include jurisdiction-specific obligations.
We believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and our controls in place are adequate for our continued compliance.
