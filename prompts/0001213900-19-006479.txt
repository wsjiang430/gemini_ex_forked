ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Cruzani, Inc. (“Cruzani” or the “Company”) is a franchise development company that builds and represents popular franchise concepts, and other related businesses, throughout the United States as well as international markets. The Company was originally formed as a limited liability company on February 5, 1999 under the name The Powerhouse, L.L.C. pursuant to the laws of the State of Oklahoma. On November 9, 2006, Powerhouse Productions, L.L.C. filed Articles of Conversion changing the entity from a limited liability company to a corporation under the name Harcom Productions, Inc. On January 25, 2010, Articles of Merger were filed with the State of Oklahoma merging U.S. Highland, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation into Harcom Productions, Inc. and the name of the corporation was changed to US Highland, Inc. US Highland, Inc. was a recreational power sports Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”), developing motorcycles, quads, single cylinder engines, and v-twin engines under its own brand and for other OEMs. During 2017, the Company exited the recreational power sports OEM and leisure activity vehicles markets.
 
On June 29, 2018, the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada to change its name to Cruzani, Inc. The name change is subject to approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (known as “FINRA”).
 
On June 30, 2018, Supreme Sweets Acquisition Corp. (n/k/a Oventa, Inc.), a subsidiary of the Company, and the Company (collectively, the “Company”) entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Supreme Sweets Inc. and 2498411 Ontario, Inc., as sellers (collectively, the “Seller”), pursuant to which in exchange for CAD $200,000 and a twenty percent (20%) interest in Oventa, Inc., the Company agreed to acquire the trade secret assets of Seller upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. A second closing occurred on July 31, 2018, pursuant to which the Company acquired the furniture, fixtures and equipment of Seller in exchange for CAD $100,000. Seller is engaged in the business of preparing delicious snacks, pastries and baked goods with high quality ingredients for exceptional taste, including low calorie and gluten-free alternatives. The Asset Purchase Agreement included a provision, pursuant to which the Company could unwind the transaction if certain milestones were not achieved. The milestones contemplated in the Asset Purchase Agreement were not met, and accordingly, effective on December 31, 2018, by written notice to the Seller, the Company unwound the transaction. The capital injected into Oventa, Inc., however, has been secured pursuant to financing statements filed on behalf of the Company, and the Company expects to receive a return of its injected capital during the calendar year 2019. Subsequent to the December 31 notification, the parties searched for a resolution in an effort to salvage the transaction. In early February, however, it was determined that there wasn’t an acceptable path forward. At that time, the company filed a Form 8-K regarding the matter. 
 
On September 27, 2018, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Sandrea Gibson, as seller (the “Seller”), and Recipe Food Co., as the target (the “Target”), pursuant to which in exchange for up to CAD $237,000, the Company agreed to acquire 80% of the issued and outstanding stock of the Target from the Seller upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. Seller is engaged in the business of preparing and serving delicious, healthy meals on a counter-service basis with high quality ingredients, including low calorie alternatives. Difficulties integrating the Target into the Company group, forced the Company to cease injecting additional capital into the Target. The Target is currently on the market for disposition to a third-party buyer on an arms-length basis.

The Cruzani Platform
 
Cruzani’s core value proposition relates to the platform of services it offers to potential food entrepreneurs. Cruzani’s goal is to propel those entrepreneurs to the next level of success. Cruzani focuses on the following areas:
Performance Appreciation
 
We have the skills and connections to ascertain hidden value for food entrepreneurs. Private companies can experience higher valuations in the public capital market. Potential franchise partners may have assets, skills and concepts that don’t appear on its balance sheet that make all the difference in the world to the savvy public market, where investors have vision. Cruzani aims to help the food entrepreneur discover the qualities that they take for granted – and capitalize them to achieve the next level of success that they deserve.
Public Capital Market Experience
 
Navigating the public markets takes special knowledge, dedication and aptitude. Most private entrepreneurs could never make this leap by themselves. That’s were Cruzani comes in. If a potential food enterprise has the potential to satisfy customers and the investing public, both, then Cruzani has the ability to implement that plan. By being part of the Cruzani organization as a continuing co-venture partner or by divesting an entire enterprise to Cruzani, we have the goal of finding the right solution for our franchise partners.
Media Development
 
Public companies are in the public eye. Cruzani works to help food entrepreneurs to transition from being a local food enterprise that has looked for ways to create awareness, into a widely known operation. Public companies have communication resources and expertise that are just not practical for smaller firms to maintain. As Cruzani integrates itself into its franchise partners’ operations and discovers their food enterprise’s qualities, we can apply a national, and international, platform for getting the franchise’s message out for the benefit of all involved. As partners in success, Cruzani focuses on bringing select private food enterprises into our family of holdings so that they can benefit from group talents and resources.
Exit Horizon
 
No matter how much a food entrepreneur loves their food concept, there is always the potential for and exit to allow them to pursue other opportunities. Cruzani structures its platform to accommodate for operators to stay with their business in partnership or as a co-venturer with Cruzani as well as full scale acquisitions.
Facilities
 
The Company currently has no ownership or leases of property. The Company’s business mailing address is 3500 Lennox Road, Suite 1500, Atlanta, Georgia 30309. The Company’s primary phone number is (404) 419-2253.

Cruzani, Inc. does not have any employees other than our chief executive officer. There are no collective-bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced work interruptions or strikes. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
