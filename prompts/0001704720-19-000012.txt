Item 1. | Business

Introductory Note
The following describes the business of Cannae Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Except where otherwise noted, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” "Cannae", "Cannae Holdings", "the Company," or “CNNE” are to Cannae Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken together.
Company Background
On November 17, 2017, Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (“FNF”) redeemed each outstanding share of its FNF Ventures ("FNFV") Group common stock, par value $0.0001, for one share of common stock, par value $0.0001, of a newly formed entity, Cannae Holdings, Inc., with cash in lieu of fractional shares (the "Split-Off"). In conjunction with the Split-Off, FNF contributed to us its majority and minority equity investment stakes in a number of entities, including American Blue Ribbon Holdings, LLC ("ABRH"), Ceridian Holding, LLC, T-System Holdings, LLC ("T-System"), and various other controlled portfolio companies and other minority equity investments. On November 20, 2017, Cannae common stock began “regular-way” trading on The New York Stock Exchange under the “CNNE” stock symbol.
On April 26, 2018, our minority-owned subsidiary Ceridian HCM Holding, Inc. ("Ceridian"), the parent of Ceridian Holding, LLC, completed its initial public offering (the "Ceridian IPO"). Following the Ceridian IPO, Ceridian's shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") under the ticker symbol “CDAY.” We retained the majority of our investment in Ceridian following its IPO. As of December 31, 2018, we own 23.5% of the outstanding common stock of Ceridian. 
On February 8, 2019, Cannae and an investment consortium (the “Consortium”) including CC Capital Partners LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners along with other investors completed the previously announced acquisition of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Dun & Bradstreet")(the "DNB Acquisition"). Of our previously disclosed $900.0 million commitment to purchase common equity of the parent of Dun & Bradstreet, we retained and funded a $505.6 million investment, representing 24.5% of the outstanding common equity, and syndicated the remainder to other investors. 
Refer to discussion under Recent Developments in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report") for further information on the Ceridian IPO and DNB Acquisition and related transactions.
Description of Business
We are a holding company engaged in actively managing and operating a group of companies and investments with a net asset value of approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. Our business consists of managing and operating majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as making additional majority and minority equity portfolio investments in businesses, in order to achieve superior financial performance and maximize the value of these assets. Our primary investments as of December 31, 2018 include our ownership interest in Ceridian; majority equity ownership stakes in ABRH, 99 Restaurants Holdings, LLC ("99 Restaurants") and T-System and various other controlled portfolio companies and minority equity and debt investments.
As of December 31, 2018, we had the following reportable segments:
Restaurant Group.  This segment consists of the operations of ABRH and 99 Restaurants, in which we have 65.4% and 88.5% ownership interests, respectively. ABRH and its affiliates are the owners and operators of the O'Charley's, Village Inn and Bakers Square food service and restaurant concepts, as well as the Legendary Baking bakery operation. 99 Restaurants and its affiliates are the owners and operators of the Ninety Nine Restaurants & Pub restaurant concept. ABRH and 99 Restaurants collectively operate more than 550 company and franchise family and casual dining restaurants and bakery operations in 40 states and Guam. 
On November 6, 2018, we completed an internal restructuring of the Restaurant Group whereby 99 Restaurants was separated from ABRH. Refer to discussion under Recent Developments in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for further information.
Ceridian.  This segment consists of our 23.5% ownership interest in Ceridian. Ceridian is a global human capital management (“HCM”) software company. Dayforce, Ceridian's flagship cloud HCM platform, provides human resources (“HR”), payroll, benefits, workforce management, and talent management functionality. In addition to Dayforce, Ceridian sells Powerpay, a cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market, through both direct sales and established partner channels. Ceridian also continues to support customers using its Bureau solutions, which Ceridian generally stopped actively selling to new customers in 2012, following the acquisition of Dayforce. Ceridian invests in maintenance and necessary updates to support its Bureau customers and continues to migrate them to Dayforce. We account for our investment in Ceridian under the equity method of accounting and therefore its results of operations do not consolidate into ours. 
 1

T-System. This segment consists of the operations of our 97%-owned subsidiary, T-System, acquired on October 16, 2017. T-System is a provider of clinical documentation and coding solutions to hospital-based and free-standing emergency departments and urgent care facilities. T-System organizes itself into two businesses. The Clinical Documentation business offers software solutions providing clinical staff with full workflow operations that drive documentation completeness and revenue optimization to more than 240 customers at more than 450 customer sites. Additionally, the patented T-Sheet is the industry standard for emergency department documentation, with more than 200 customers at more than 475 customer sites. The Coding Software & Outsourced Solutions business provides a full-service outsourced coding solution as well as a cloud-based software-as-a-service solution for self-service coding. These offerings help more than 75 customers at over 400 sites optimize their revenue cycle workflow and customer revenue reimbursement through improved coding accuracy and compliance and coder productivity compared to in-house coding.
Corporate and Other.  This segment consists of our share in the operations of controlled and uncontrolled portfolio companies including our 24.8% equity interest in Triple Tree Holdings, LLC ("Triple Tree"), our wholly-owned subsidiary Cannae Timber Resources LLC ("CTR"), our interest in the debt of Colt Holding LLC ("Colt Defense"), and other various majority and minority equity investments. Triple Tree is an independent, research-driven investment banking firm focused on mergers and acquisitions, financial restructuring, and principal investing services for innovative, high-growth businesses in the healthcare industry. CTR and its subsidiaries currently operate and invest in golf and real estate properties and develop, manage and operate residential and recreational properties, including a 1,800-acre ranch-style luxury resort and residential community in Oregon and an 18-hole championship golf facility in Idaho. Colt Defense researches, develops, manufactures and sells firearms for military and personal defense and recreational purposes in the U.S. and internationally. As of December 31, 2018, we own debt of Colt Defense with a market value of $17.8 million.
Strategy
We actively manage a group of companies and investments with a net asset value of approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. Our strategy for the Company is to continue our activities with respect to such business investments to achieve superior financial performance, maximize and ultimately monetize the value of those assets and to continue to pursue similar investments in businesses and to grow and achieve superior financial performance with respect to such newly acquired businesses.
Restaurant Group. Our restaurant operations are focused in the family dining and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry. The Restaurant Group's strategy is to achieve long-term profit growth and drive increases in same store sales and guest counts. We have a highly experienced management team that is focused on enhancing the guest experience at our restaurants and building team member engagement. We also utilize a shared service platform that takes advantage of the combined back-office synergies of our restaurant operating companies. We expect to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet for our Restaurant Group to provide stability in all operating environments.
Ceridian. Ceridian's business has transformed from a legacy service-bureau model into a cloud-based provider model, and in the second half of 2016, Cloud revenue surpassed Bureau revenue for the first time. Ceridian's flagship cloud offering, Dayforce, is a cloud solution that meets HCM needs with one employee record and one user experience throughout the application. As evidenced by its more than 60% compound annual growth rate since 2012, we believe that the Dayforce cloud offering, built on a single database, enjoys a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We believe Ceridian's Dayforce offering is a market leader as shown by both extensive recognition and industry awards. Nucleus Research named Dayforce as the leader in both HCM technology and Workforce Management, based on functionality and usability. In addition, Gartner Peer Insights placed Ceridian's Dayforce offering in the leader quadrant in global payroll services, and Ventana Research found Dayforce as the leader in both usability and capability in its Value Index. During 2016, Ceridian won several awards for Dayforce, including a TekTonic Award from HRO Today Magazine, a Gold American Business Award for best new product, and a Ventana Research Technology Innovation Award, among others.
T-System. T-System is engaged in providing clinical, financial, operational, and regulatory solutions for hospital emergency room ("ER") departments, free-standing emergency departments ("ED"), and urgent care healthcare facilities. T-System offers documentation solutions, including EV, an emergency department information system; EV for physicians, a solution with ER-specific clinical content and workflow for emergency physicians; T Sheets Digital, a documentation solution for urgent care; and T Sheets, which provides patient care through medical records/documentation and optimized reimbursement. We also provide charge capture and coding solutions that combine intelligent coding technology with services to improve quality and compliance, and result in accurate coding and financial outcomes for various types of facilities ranging from critical access hospitals to children's hospitals; and Advanced Coding System, which facilitates accurate coding for simple encounters and multiple patient complaints, and ensures optimal reimbursement for care provided. In the past several years, there has been an increased push for interoperability across systems to address the fact that patient records will contain information from more than one health care IT system. We believe that we are positioned to take the steps to create interoperability between T-System solutions and other large IT systems.
Acquisitions, Dispositions, Minority Owned Operating Affiliates and Financings. Acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy. Dispositions have been an important aspect of our strategy of returning value to shareholders. On an ongoing 
 2

basis, with assistance from our advisors, we actively evaluate possible transactions, such as acquisitions and dispositions of business units and operating assets and business combination transactions.
In the future, we may seek to sell certain investments or other assets to increase our liquidity. Further, our management has stated that we may make acquisitions in lines of business that are not directly tied to, or synergistic with, our current operating segments. In the past we have obtained majority and minority investments in entities and securities where we see the potential to achieve above market returns. Fundamentally our goal is to acquire quality companies that are well-positioned in their respective industries, run by best-in-class management teams in industries that have attractive organic and acquired growth opportunities. We leverage our operational expertise and track record of growing industry leading companies and our active interaction with management of acquired companies, directly or through our board of directors, to ultimately provide value for our shareholders.
There can be no assurance that any suitable opportunities will arise or that any particular transaction will be completed. We have made a number of acquisitions and dispositions over the past several years to strengthen and expand our service offerings and customer base in our various businesses, to expand into other businesses or where we otherwise saw value, and to monetize investments in assets and businesses.
Through the date of this Annual Report, we have made significant progress both monetizing currently held investments and deploying capital toward new investments. Refer to discussion under Recent Developments in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for further information.
Intellectual Property
Restaurant Group. We regard our service marks, including "O'Charley's", "Ninety Nine", "Village Inn", "Legendary Baking", and "Bakers Square", and other service marks and trademarks as having significant value and as being important factors in the marketing of our restaurants. We have also obtained trademarks for several of our menu items and for various advertising slogans. We are aware of names and marks similar to our service marks and trademarks used by other persons in certain geographic areas where we have restaurants. However, we believe such uses will not adversely affect us. Our policy is to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks.
We license the use of our registered trademarks and service marks to franchisees and third parties through franchise arrangements and licenses. The franchise and license arrangements restrict franchisees' and licensees' activities with respect to the use of our trademarks and service marks, and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the trademarks and service marks.
Ceridian. Ceridian and its subsidiaries own or have the rights to various trademarks, trade names and service marks, including the following: Ceridian®, Dayforce® and various logos used in association with these terms.
T-System.T-System's intellectual property includes the following: T SheetsTM, T-System EVTM, and T-System EV4PTM. T Sheets is one of the most widely used and accepted documentation systems in emergency medicine. T Sheets is built with the most comprehensive and up-to-date clinical content and serves as the clinical documentation backbone of T-System’s industry leading software solutions. T-System EVTM and EV4PTM are category-leading best-of-breed software solutions used by the episodic care market.
Seasonality
Restaurant Group. Average weekly sales per restaurant are typically higher in the first and fourth quarters than in other quarters, and the Restaurant Group typically generates a disproportionate share of its earnings from operations in the first and fourth quarters. Holidays, severe weather and other disruptive conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. Our revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors that are beyond our control and, as a result, are likely to fluctuate.
Ceridian. Ceridian has in the past and expects in the future to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and new customer contracts with the fourth quarter historically being its strongest quarter for new customer contracts, renewals, and customer go-lives. Although the growth of Ceridian's cloud solutions and the ratable nature of its fees makes this seasonality less apparent in its overall results of operations, we expect Ceridian's revenue to fluctuate quarterly and to be higher in the fourth and first quarters of each year. Fourth quarter revenue is driven by year-end processing fees and Dayforce customer go-lives; and first quarter revenue is driven by revenue earned for printing of year-end tax packages.
T-System. The Clinical Documentation segment of T-System's business is impacted by seasonal volume increases in the first and fourth quarters compared to other quarters. The increase in charts coded is generated by seasonal flu volumes that impact the visits to health care facilities.

Inventory 
Restaurant Group. In the restaurant group's Legendary Baking business, sales of baked goods are greatest during the holiday season in the fourth quarter. As a result of inventory requirements to meet this demand, inventory is built up over the course of the first nine months of the year.
Competition
Restaurant Group. The restaurant industry is highly competitive and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns; changes in general economic conditions; public safety conditions or concerns; demographic trends; weather conditions; the cost of food products, labor, energy and other operating costs; and governmental regulations. Higher labor costs due to state and local minimum wage increases and shopping pattern shifts to e-commerce and “ready to eat” grocery and convenience stores have had a negative impact on restaurant performance, particularly in the casual and family dining restaurants in which the Company operates. 
The restaurant industry is also characterized by high capital investments for new restaurants and relatively high fixed or semi-variable restaurant operating expenses.  Because of the high fixed and semi-variable expenses, changes in sales in existing restaurants are generally expected to significantly affect restaurant profitability because many restaurant costs and expenses are not expected to change at the same rate as sales.  Restaurant profitability can also be negatively affected by inflationary and regulatory increases in operating costs and other factors.  The most significant commodities that may affect our cost of food and beverage are beef, seafood, poultry, and dairy, which accounted for approximately half of our overall cost of food and beverage in the past. Generally, temporary increases in these costs are not passed on to guests; however, in the past, we have adjusted menu prices to compensate for increased costs of a more permanent nature. Our revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors that are beyond our control and, as a result, are likely to fluctuate.
Ceridian. The market for HCM products is highly competitive. Ceridian's products compete primarily on the basis of technology, delivered functionality and performance, price, and service. Its competitors include (i) large service bureaus, primarily Automatic Data Processing Inc.; (ii) companies, such as Oracle, Kronos, Lawson, Ultimate Software and Workday that offer human resource management and payroll software products for use on mainframes, client/server environments and/or Web servers; and (iii) smaller service providers, such as Paychex.
T-System. The market for healthcare solutions is subject to intense competition and subject to rapid technological change. T-System offers solutions and services to support the clinical, financial, and operational needs for hospital ER departments, free-standing EDs, and urgent care and family practice healthcare facilities. Our competitors include companies such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Cerner Corporation, Medhost, and Epic Systems. 
Due to the pace of change within the market, we expect that major software information system companies, start-up companies, and other companies would produce new software solutions or services that would compete with evolving industry standards and requirements.
Competitive Strengths
Proven management team.  Our executive management team has a proven track record of investment identification and management. Our executive management's breadth of knowledge of capital markets allows us to identify companies and strategic assets with attractive value propositions, to structure investments to maximize their value, and to return the value created to shareholders. 
Information Security
We and our unconsolidated affiliates are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information. Attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities. These attacks can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, consumer data and proprietary business information.
We and our unconsolidated affiliates remain focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect the clients and information systems of our operating subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates. This includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses on hardware, software, personnel and consulting services. As the primary products and services of our operating subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates evolve, we apply a comprehensive approach to the mitigation of identified security risks. We have established risk management policies, including those related to information security and cybersecurity, designed to monitor and mitigate information security related risks.
Employees
As of February 1, 2019, Cannae and our consolidated subsidiaries had 26,413 full-time equivalent employees, which includes 25,920 in our Restaurant Group, 280 at T-System and 213 in the various businesses comprising our Corporate and other segment.

None of our employees are unionized or represented by any collective agency. We believe that our relations with employees are generally good.
