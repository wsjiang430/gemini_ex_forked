Item 1.    Business
Company Profile
 Getty Realty Corp., a Maryland corporation, is the leading publicly-traded real estate investment trust (“REIT”) in the United States specializing in the ownership, leasing and financing of convenience store and gasoline station properties. Our 933 properties are located in 30 states across the United States and Washington, D.C. Our properties are operated under a variety of nationally recognized brands including, among others, 76, BP, Citgo, Conoco, Exxon, Getty, Gulf, Mobil, Shell, Sunoco and Valero. We own the Getty® trademark and trade name in connection with our real estate and the petroleum marketing business in the United States.
 We are self-administered and self-managed by our management team, which has extensive experience in owning, leasing and managing convenience store and gasoline station properties. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in real estate and real estate related investments when appropriate opportunities arise. Our company is headquartered in Jericho, New York and as of February 27, 2019, we had 29 employees.
 Company Operations
 As of December 31, 2018, we owned 859 properties and leased 74 properties from third-party landlords. Our typical property is used as a convenience store and gasoline station, and is located on between one-half and one acre of land in a metropolitan area. In addition, many of our properties are located at highly trafficked urban intersections or conveniently close to highway entrances or exit ramps. We have a national portfolio of properties with a concentration in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. We believe our network of convenience store and gasoline station properties across the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States is unique and that comparable networks of properties are not readily available for purchase or lease from other owners or landlords.
 Substantially all of our properties are leased on a triple-net basis primarily to petroleum distributors, convenience store retailers and, to a lesser extent, individual operators. Generally, our tenants supply fuel and either operate our properties directly or sublet our properties to operators who operate their convenience stores, gasoline stations, automotive repair service facilities or other businesses at our properties. Our triple-net tenants are responsible for the payment of all taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance and other operating expenses relating to our properties, and are also responsible for environmental contamination occurring during the terms of their leases and in certain cases also for environmental contamination that existed before their leases commenced. For additional information regarding our environmental obligations, see Note 5 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.
 Convenience store and gasoline station properties are an integral component of the transportation infrastructure supported by highly inelastic demand for refined petroleum products, day-to-day consumer goods and convenience foods. Substantially all of our tenants’ financial results depend on the sale of refined petroleum products, convenience store sales or rental income from their subtenants. As a result, our tenants’ financial results are highly dependent on the performance of the petroleum marketing industry, which is highly competitive and subject to volatility. During the terms of our leases, we monitor the credit quality of our triple-net tenants by reviewing their published credit rating, if available, reviewing publicly available financial statements, or reviewing financial or other operating statements which are delivered to us pursuant to applicable lease agreements, monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and monitoring the timeliness of lease payments and the performance of other financial covenants under their leases.
 Our Properties 
 Net Lease. As of December 31, 2018, we leased 918 of our properties to tenants under triple-net leases.
 Our net lease properties include 814 properties leased under 26 separate unitary or master triple-net leases and 104 properties leased under single unit triple-net leases. These leases generally provide for an initial term of 15 or 20 years with options for successive renewal terms of up to 20 years and periodic rent escalations. As of December 31, 2018, our contractual rent weighted average lease term, excluding renewal options, was approximately 10 years. 
 Several of our leases provide for additional rent based on the aggregate volume of fuel sold. For the year ended December 31, 2018, additional rent based on the aggregate volume of fuel sold was not material to our financial results. In addition, certain of our leases require the tenants to invest capital in our properties, substantially all of which are related to the replacement of underground storage tanks (“UST” or “USTs”) that are owned by our tenants. As of December 31, 2018, we have a remaining commitment to fund up to $7.6 million in the aggregate with our tenants for our portion of such capital improvements. For additional information regarding our leases, see Note 2 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.
 Redevelopment. As of December 31, 2018, we were actively redeveloping six of our properties either as a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. For additional information regarding our redevelopment properties, see “Redevelopment Strategy and Activity” below.
 5


Vacancies. As of December 31, 2018, nine of our properties were vacant. We expect that we will either sell or enter into new leases on these properties over time.
 Investment Strategy and Activity
 As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition and financing opportunities to invest in additional convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. In addition to sale/leaseback and other real estate acquisitions, our investment activities include purchase money financing with respect to properties we sell, and real property loans relating to our leasehold portfolios. Our investment strategy seeks to generate current income and benefit from long-term appreciation in the underlying value of our real estate. To achieve that goal, we seek to invest in high quality individual properties and real estate portfolios that are in strong primary markets that serve high density population centers. A key element of our investment strategy is to invest in properties that will promote our geographic and tenant diversity.
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired fee simple interests in 41 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $78.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired fee simple interests in 103 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $214.0 million. For additional information regarding our property acquisitions, see Note 13 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.
 Over the last five years, we have acquired 238 properties, located in various states, for an aggregate purchase price of $536.5 million. These acquisitions included single property transactions and portfolio transactions.
 Redevelopment Strategy and Activity
 We believe that certain of our properties are located in geographic areas, which together with other factors, may make them well-suited for a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses, such as quick service restaurants, automotive parts and service stores, specialty retail stores and bank branch locations. We believe that the redeveloped properties can be leased or sold at higher values than their current use.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, rent commenced on six completed redevelopment projects that were placed back into service in our net lease portfolio. Since the inception of our redevelopment program in 2015, we have completed nine redevelopment projects.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $2.7 million of construction-in-progress costs related to our redevelopment activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we transferred $2.2 million of construction-in-progress to buildings and improvements on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $4.4 million to reimburse tenants for capital expenditures related to our redevelopment activities.
 As of December 31, 2018, we were actively redeveloping six of our properties either as a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. In addition, to the six properties currently classified as redevelopment, we are in various stages of feasibility and planning for the recapture of select properties from our net lease portfolio that are suitable for redevelopment to either a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. As of December 31, 2018, we have signed leases on seven properties, that are currently part of our net lease portfolio, which will be recaptured and transferred to redevelopment when the appropriate entitlements, permits and approvals have been secured.
 The History of Our Company
 Our founders started the business in 1955 with the ownership of one gasoline service station in New York City and combined real estate ownership, leasing and management with service station operation and petroleum distribution. We held our initial public offering in 1971 under the name Power Test Corp. In 1985, we acquired from Texaco the petroleum distribution and marketing assets of Getty Oil Company in the Northeast United States along with the Getty® name and trademark in connection with our real estate and the petroleum marketing business in the United States.
 Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. (“Marketing”), which was an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of OAO Lukoil (“Lukoil”) from December 2000 until March 2011, was our principal tenant under a long-term unitary triple-net master lease. In December 2011, Marketing filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy proceedings resulted in the termination of the master lease effective April 30, 2012, followed by the liquidation of Marketing. As of December 31, 2018, 374 of the properties we own or lease were previously leased to Marketing.
 We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. A REIT is a corporation, or a business trust that would otherwise be taxed as a corporation, which meets certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code permits a qualifying REIT to deduct dividends paid, thereby effectively eliminating corporate level federal income tax and making the REIT a pass-through vehicle for federal income tax purposes. To meet the applicable requirements of the

Internal Revenue Code, a REIT must, among other things, invest substantially all of its assets in interests in real estate (including mortgages and other REITs) or cash and government securities, derive most of its income from rents from real property or interest on loans secured by mortgages on real property, and distribute to stockholders annually a substantial portion of its taxable income. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders each year and would be subject to corporate level federal income taxes on any taxable income that is not distributed.
 Major Tenants
 As of December 31, 2018, we had three significant tenants by revenue:
  
• | We leased 157 convenience store and gasoline station properties in three separate unitary leases and three stand-alone leases to subsidiaries of Global Partners LP (NYSE: GLP) (“Global”). In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Global represented 17% and 21% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. All of our unitary leases with subsidiaries of Global are guaranteed by the parent company.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We leased 77 convenience store and gasoline station properties pursuant to three separate unitary leases to Apro, LLC (d/b/a “United Oil”). In the aggregate, our leases with United Oil represented 13% and 15% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We leased 76 convenience store and gasoline station properties pursuant to two separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Chestnut Petroleum Dist., Inc. (“Chestnut”). In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Chestnut represented 11% and 13% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The largest of these unitary leases, covering 57 of our properties, is guaranteed by the parent company, its principals and numerous Chestnut affiliates.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our major tenants are part of larger corporate organizations and the financial distress of one subsidiary or other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. For information regarding factors that could adversely affect us relating to our leases with these tenants, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.
 Competition
 The single-tenant net lease retail sector of the real estate industry in which we operate is highly competitive. In addition, we expect major real estate investors with significant capital will continue to compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, other REITs, public and private investment funds, and other individual and institutional investors.
Trademarks
 We own the Getty® name and trademark in connection with our real estate and the petroleum marketing business in the United States and we permit certain of our tenants to use the Getty® trademark at properties that they lease from us.
Regulation
 Our properties are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations including matters related to the protection of the environment such as the remediation of known contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. These laws include: (i) requirements to report to governmental authorities discharges of petroleum products into the environment and, under certain circumstances, to remediate soil and groundwater contamination, including pursuant to governmental order and directive, (ii) requirements to remove and replace USTs that have exceeded governmental-mandated age limitations and (iii) the requirement to provide a certificate of financial responsibility with respect to potential claims relating to UST failures. Our triple-net lease tenants are directly responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations with respect to their operations at our properties.
 We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with federal, state and local provisions pertaining to environmental matters. Although we are unable to predict what legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future with respect to environmental protection and waste disposal, we do not believe that existing legislation and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. For additional information regarding pending environmental lawsuits and claims, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this Form 10-K.
 For substantially all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term (the cost of which in certain cases is partially borne by us) and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leased to Marketing (substantially all of which commenced in 2012), we have agreed to be responsible for environmental

contamination at the premises that was known at the time the lease commenced, and for environmental contamination which existed prior to commencement of the lease and is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first 10 years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of such leases). After expiration of such 10-year (or, in certain cases, shorter) period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of the lease, is contractually allocated to our tenant. Our tenants at properties previously leased to Marketing are in all cases responsible for the cost of any remediation of contamination that results from their use and occupancy of our properties. Under substantially all of our other triple-net leases, responsibility for remediation of all environmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease) is the responsibility of our tenant.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and to Note 5 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.
