ITEM 1.  Business
 
Pending Merger Agreement with PDS
 
On November 23, 2018, Edge, Merger Sub and PDS, a privately-held clinical-stage cancer immunotherapy company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into PDS, with PDS surviving the merger as the wholly-owned subsidiary of the combined company.
 
If the merger is completed, the business of Edge will become the business of PDS. If the merger is not completed, Edge will reconsider its strategic alternatives and may pursue one of the following courses of action, which Edge currently believes are the most likely alternatives if the merger with PDS is not completed:
 
  
● | Pursue another strategic transaction similar to the merger. Edge may resume its process of evaluating other companies interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with Edge and, if a candidate is identified, focus its attention on negotiating and completing such a transaction with such candidate. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dissolve and liquidate its assets. If Edge is unable, or does not believe that it is able, to find a suitable candidate for another strategic transaction, Edge may dissolve and liquidate its assets. In the event of dissolution, Edge would be required to pay all of its debts and contractual obligations and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims. If Edge dissolves and liquidates its assets, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of available cash that will remain for distribution to Edge’s stockholders after paying Edge’ debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for its reserves.

Overview
 
Edge is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that seeks to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies capable of transforming treatment paradigms in the management of medical conditions.
 
On March 28, 2018, Edge announced that a pre-specified interim analysis performed on data from the Day 90 visit of the first 210 subjects randomized and treated in the Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, NEWTON 2 study of EG-1962 in adults with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage demonstrated a low probability of achieving a statistically-significant difference compared to the standard of care in the study’s primary endpoint, if the study were to be fully enrolled. The independent Data Monitoring Committee, or the DMC, for the NEWTON 2 study recommended that the study be stopped based on this demonstration. The DMC also reported that there were no safety concerns attributed to EG-1962.
 
Based on the DMC recommendation, Edge decided to discontinue the NEWTON 2 study and took steps to notify health authorities and clinical investigators participating in the study.
 
The NEWTON 2 study was designed to detect a 15% absolute improvement in favorable outcomes at Day 90 for the EG-1962 treatment group with a target enrollment of 374 subjects with WFNS grades 2-4 and an external ventricular drain, or EVD. Prior to discontinuation of the study, 289 subjects were randomized and 282 were treated. The final analysis showed that overall in the study’s primary endpoint, 46% (64/138) of subjects treated with a single intraventricular injection of EG-1962 experienced a favorable outcome (a score of 6 to 8 on the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, or GOSE) at Day 90, compared to 43% (62/144) of subjects treated with oral nimodipine. The GOSE is a clinically validated scale to assess recovery for patients who have suffered a brain injury.
 
In the NEWTON 2 study, at randomization, subjects were stratified by baseline severity as measured by the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons, or WFNS, grade. Results of a logistic regression analysis of Day 90 GOSE outcomes including interactions revealed a statistically significant treatment by WFNS group interaction (p=0.0381). In the pre-specified subgroup of subjects with WFNS grade 3 or 4 (i.e., severe aSAH subjects), 46% (32/69) of subjects treated with EG-1962 experienced a favorable outcome as measured by GOSE, compared to 32% (24/75) of subjects treated with oral nimodipine. While these results did not achieve statistical significance (as the NEWTON 2 study was not powered to provide statistical significance for subgroups), they suggest a clinically meaningful potential benefit for EG-1962 in subjects with WFNS grade 3 or 4. Further, these results are consistent with results from Edge’s Phase 1/2 NEWTON study. In that study, EG-1962 demonstrated a similar efficacy trend in favorable outcome rate compared to oral nimodipine in severe aSAH subjects with WFNS grades 3 or 4, with 37% (10/27) of the subjects treated with EG-1962 experiencing a favorable outcome, compared to 23% (3/13) of the subjects treated with oral nimodipine.

In the WFNS grade 2 subgroup (i.e., moderate aSAH subjects), favorable outcome rates from the NEWTON 2 study were inconsistent with those observed in the Phase 1/2 NEWTON study in both the EG-1962 and oral nimodipine treatment groups. In addition, the favorable response rate in the control group in NEWTON 2 was higher than, and inconsistent with, that reported in the medical literature.
 
Edge did not identify any safety concerns that would have halted the NEWTON 2 study or precluded further development of EG-1962. Notably, the incidence of vasospasm was significantly lower in the EG-1962 treatment group compared to the standard of care, oral nimodipine. In addition, there was a lower incidence of both mortality and hypotension in the EG-1962 treatment group.
 
Based on the overall findings of the NEWTON 2 study, Edge has explored whether any third party(ies) would be interested in acquiring rights to EG-1962.  To date, there has been no significant interest expressed by any third party.
 
On April 17, 2018, the Edge Board of Directors, or the Edge Board, established a committee of convenience, the Transactions Committee, to explore strategic alternatives for Edge in order to maximize both near and long-term value for Edge shareholders, which might have included, without limitation, an acquisition of another company, acquisitions or in-licensing of products or product candidates, technologies or other assets, the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Edge, a sale of stock, a strategic merger or other business combination transaction or other transaction between Edge and a third party.
 
In April 2018, the Edge Board retained Piper Jaffray & Co., or Piper Jaffray, to serve as its financial advisor in certain aspects of the strategic review process. Throughout the strategic alternatives review and selection process, Edge has continued to finance its operations with its existing cash. In addition, Edge has reduced the scope of its operations, including the size of its workforce, in order to preserve cash resources. Edge has ceased research and development on EG-1962, including the completion of the NEWTON 2 study, and all of Edge’s other product candidates.
 
After a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives, on November 23, 2018, Edge, Merger Sub and PDS entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into PDS, with PDS surviving the merger as the wholly-owned subsidiary of the combined company.  PDS is a private company with a growing pipeline of clinical-stage immunotherapies that are expected to treat various early-stage cancers, including head and neck cancer, cervical cancer, anal cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and other cancers.  Following the merger, the combined company expects to focus on developing PDS’s growing pipeline of next-generation cancer immunotherapies based on the proprietary, multi-functional Versamune® technology platform, the development of PDS0101 for the treatment of multiple human papilloma virus (HPV)-induced cancers, including cervical, anal and head and neck cancers, and multiple preclinical programs developing Versamune®-based cancer immunotherapies in combination with checkpoint inhibitors for various late-stage cancers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The protection of Edge’s product candidates, Edge’s manufacturing methods, delivery systems and patient treatment protocols, and associated trade secrets and know-how are important to Edge’s business. Edge has sought patent protection in the United States and internationally relating to EG-1962, a microparticulate formulation of nimodipine. Edge’s policy is to seek, maintain and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or in-licensed, and to protect technologies, improvements and trade secrets that may be important to Edge’s business.
 
Edge’s commercial success will depend in part upon obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for Edge’s product candidates, including components of Edge’s proprietary formulations, methods of manufacturing Edge’s product candidates, delivery systems, and methods of treating patients with Edge’s product candidates, as well as successfully defending Edge’s patent rights against third party challenges. Edge’s ability to prevent or stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing Edge’s product candidates will depend in part upon whether Edge has valid and enforceable patent rights that cover the activities of third parties.
 
Patent Rights
 
Edge has been building Edge’s patent portfolio. Where possible, Edge has pursued multi-tiered patent protection for Edge’s product candidates and their manufacture, delivery and use. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, Edge has filed counterpart patent applications in various countries and regions where Edge thinks such foreign filing is likely to be cost-effective.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which Edge files, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application, with up to an additional five-year patent term extension available for regulatory delay. In the United States, a patent’s term may also be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in granting a patent. However, the term of a United States patent may be shortened, if the patent term for a patent is terminally disclaimed by its owner, over another patent.

Patent Rights Associated with EG-1962
 
Edge wholly-owns one issued U.S. patent (expected to expire in 2029 if all maintenance fees are paid) directed to a method of treating a cerebral vasospasm in a human by administering a pharmaceutical composition via surgical injection into the subarachnoid space in a cistern closest to a cerebral artery at risk for vasospasm. Edge also has been granted patent protection for this invention in Australia (3), Canada, China, Germany, Great Britain, France, Switzerland, Spain, Israel, Japan, Korea (3), New Zealand (2) and Singapore.
 
Edge has wholly-owned patents (expected to expire in 2032 if all maintenance fees are paid) directed to a method of treating, and a microparticulate delivery system for treating, a delayed complication associated with brain injury where the brain injury includes interruption of at least one cerebral artery in Germany, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Italy and Hong Kong; a notice of allowance has issued in Israel.
 
Edge also has a wholly-owned U.S. patent (expected to expire in 2029 if all maintenance fees are paid) claiming a method of treating a cerebral artery in the subarachnoid space of a human at risk of interruption due to a brain injury by administering locally a microparticulate composition into a cerebral ventricle. Patent protection for these inventions has been granted in Australia, China,  Switzerland, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand, Russia and Singapore.
 
Edge also has a wholly-owned U.S. patent (expected to expire in 2029 if all maintenance fees are paid) claiming a method for treating a delayed complication of a brain injury that deposits blood in a subarachnoid space of the brain, wherein the brain injury is mediated by decreased cerebral perfusion, comprising providing a flowable particulate composition comprising a microparticulate suspension containing a calcium channel antagonist and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier comprising an agent that affects viscosity of the microparticulate suspension of claimed release characteristics, and a drug load of at least 40%; and administering the composition locally either intracisternally, intraventricularly or intrathecally. Patent protection for this invention has been granted in New Zealand and United Kingdom.
 
In addition to the foregoing, Edge has used Edge’s Precisa development platform, in collaboration with Evonik Industries, or Evonik, to seek to develop pharmaceutical compositions that contain particular polymorphic forms of nimodipine. Based on the collaboration, Edge co-owns, together with Evonik, two issued U.S. patents claiming a process for producing microparticles encapsulating a particular polymorphic form of nimodipine, a semisolid delivery system containing microparticles comprising the particular polymorphic form of nimodipine, and a method of treating a cerebral artery in a subarachnoid space at risk of interruption due to a brain injury using such a delivery system. These patents are expected to expire in 2033 if all maintenance fees are paid. Edge also co-owns, with Evonik, related patents granted in Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Singapore. The issued U.S. patents cover the microparticulate formulation used in the NEWTON study. Evonik, as successor to SurModics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or SurModics, under Edge’s license agreement initially with SurModics, has granted Edge an exclusive, field-restricted, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under its patent rights together with enforcement rights against infringers, all pursuant to Edge’s license agreement with Evonik relating to the co-owned patent rights.
 
Manufacturing
 
Edge has no present intention to manufacture EG-1962 or any other product. Edge currently has (1) an amended and restated master formulation development agreement and (2) a manufacturing and supply agreement, each for EG-1962 and each with Oakwood Laboratories, or Oakwood, but no work is being performed under either agreement.
Competition
 
Edge has no current plans to further develop or commercialize its portfolio of products. However, to the extent the merger with PDS results in the further development of the candidates in its portfolio, potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Key competitive factors are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Many of these potential competitors have substantial financial, technical and human resources and significant experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Further, mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of competitors. Accordingly, competitors may be more successful in obtaining FDA approval for therapies and achieving widespread market acceptance. Competitors’ products may also be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate that may be commercialized and may render Edge’ therapies obsolete or non-competitive before development and commercialization expenses can be recovered.

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of new drugs.
 
A number of different regulatory agencies may be involved, depending on the product at issue, and the type and stage of activity. These include the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other federal agencies, state boards of pharmacy, state-controlled substance agencies and more.
 
U.S. Government Regulation
 
Drug Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA is a primary regulator of drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and other compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject Edge to adverse consequences and administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Edge. These sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications; withdrawal or restriction of an approval; imposition of a clinical hold or other limitation on research; warning letters; product seizures; total or partial suspension of development, production, or distribution; or injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal payments or penalties.
 
The process required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 
  
● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal trials and formulation trials conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, animal welfare laws and other applicable regulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application which must become effective before clinical trials (trials in human subjects) in the United States may begin, obtaining similar authorizations in other jurisdictions where clinical research will be conducted and maintaining these authorizations on a continuing basis throughout the time that trials are performed and new data are collected; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices to demonstrate whether a proposed drug is safe and effective for its proposed intended use; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of a marketing authorization application, such as a new drug application, or NDA, and submitting similar marketing authorization applications in other jurisdictions where commercialization will be pursued; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or other marketing authorization application.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The development, testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, as well as bearing inherent risk that individual products will not exhibit relevant safety, effectiveness, or quality characteristics. Edge cannot be certain that any approvals for its product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or with the specific terms that Edge desires, if at all.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, Edge is subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, and governing any future distribution and commercial sales, if any, of Edge’ products. Whether or not FDA approval is obtained for a drug candidate, the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, must approve commencement of clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunction, viral diseases or orphan medicinal products, and optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization based on the favorable scientific opinion of the European Medicines Agency that is valid for all European Union member states and the European Economic Area Countries (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) through the EEA Treaty. The decentralized procedure provides for national approval to be granted in more than two or more member states based on an assessment of an application performed by the Member State leading the scientific evaluation, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether or not to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not accept the assessment of the reference member state on grounds relating to potential serious risk to public health, the points of disagreement are first referred to the coordination group on mutual recognition and decentralized procedures where all the member states are required to use their best endeavors to reach agreement on the action to be taken. If the Member States fail to reach an agreement within 60 days in the referral to the coordination group, the application will be referred to the European Medicines Agency for arbitration which will lead to a binding decision to be adopted by the European Commission.
 
The above overview describes the current drug approval framework in the European Union. In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The Brexit implementation process is complex and ongoing. When finalized, Brexit may have implications on the drug approval framework in the European Union. The specifics of the potential impact of Brexit on the drug approval process are unclear at this time.
