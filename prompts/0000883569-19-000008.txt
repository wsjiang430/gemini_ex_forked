Traditional Watches and Smartwatches
Traditional watches and smartwatches are our core global business. Sales of watches for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 accounted for approximately 80.0%, 78.9% and 76.6%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
Owned Brands
Our primary owned watch brands include FOSSIL, MICHELE, MISFIT, RELIC, SKAGEN and ZODIAC.
Licensed Brands
We have entered into multi-year, worldwide exclusive license agreements for the manufacture, distribution and sale of watches bearing the brand names of certain globally recognized fashion brands. The following table sets forth information with respect to our primary watch licenses:

 _______________________________________

1. | Subject to early termination

We signed license agreements with BMW and Puma in 2018 and expect to launch products under these brands in the first and second quarters of 2018, respectively. The Tory Burch license was extended to February 28, 2019 from its original expiration date of December 31, 2018, and we are negotiating a new long-term agreement to continue the distribution of our Tory Burch products.
Fashion Accessories
In addition to our core watch business, we also design and create jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, and belts across our owned brands and watches and jewelry under our licensed brands. In the U.S. and certain international markets, we generally market our fashion accessory lines through the same distribution channels as our watches using similar marketing approaches. Our fashion accessories are typically sold in locations adjacent to watch departments, which may lead to purchases by persons who are familiar with our watch brands. Sales of our accessory lines accounted for 18.4%, 19.7% and 21.6% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The following table sets forth information about our fashion accessories:

Brand | Accessory Category 
DIESEL | Jewelry 
EMPORIO ARMANI | Jewelry 
FOSSIL | Handbags, small leather goods, belts, eyewear, jewelry
MICHAEL KORS | Jewelry 
RELIC | Handbags, small leather goods, belts 
SKAGEN | Jewelry, small leather goods 

Licensed Eyewear
In January 2014, we entered into a license agreement with the Safilo Group for both FOSSIL branded sunglasses and optical frames worldwide. The license agreement provides for royalties to be paid to us based on a percentage of net sales and includes certain guaranteed minimum royalties. Sales of licensed eyewear accounted for approximately 0.4% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Private Label
We design, market and source manufacturing of certain retailers' private label and owned brand watches as well as other company brands to be used as premium and incentive items in various corporate events. Under these arrangements, we perform design and product development functions, as well as act as a sourcing agent for our customers by contracting for and managing the manufacturing process, purchasing and inspecting of the finished product and arranging for shipment. Participation in the private label and premium businesses provides us with certain advantages, including increased assembly volume, which may reduce the costs of assembling our other products, and strengthen business relationships with our manufacturing sources.
Building Strong Brands
Brand building is critical to the success of our Company. We take a consumer-first approach to creating product and brand experiences, with the goal of building meaningful, long-term relationships with our consumers.
Product Design and Development
Our product designs are fueled by a combination of creativity, fashion trends and consumer insights. Over the past 30 plus years, we have built an incredible in-house design team that works in partnership with our consumer insights and trend teams to ideate, design, test and deliver new product concepts to market. We also employ more than 200 research and development ("R&D") team members who focus on innovation and product development across our watch and smartwatch categories.
In order to respond to and capitalize on fast-paced changes in the global marketplace, we have created a process that allows us to design and develop consumer insight driven product in as little as 30 days. We have found speed coupled with insight-driven product to be a true differentiator and key revenue driver across our business.
Marketing and Promotion
We are embracing the changing retail environment and meeting consumers where they are, both on and offline. Our focus on creating the best possible brand experiences requires a blend of art and science—which means prioritizing both creativity and data in everything we do. We have created an in-house digital marketing center of excellence serving both our owned and licensed brands to connect with consumers and to serve up personalized, engaging content. This allows us to learn about their behavior across all channels including digital marketing, social media, Customer Relationship Management ("CRM") and digital media. We drive innovation using a rapid test-and-learn approach with continuous optimization. We are also able to deliver a high level of personalization through the consumer insight and predictive analytics capabilities we have built over the past few years and through our partnerships with leading online third-party retailers.

Operating Strategy
Our goal is to drive shareholder value by increasing earnings and making a positive impact on our people, planet and communities. While we currently operate in a challenging business environment we are leveraging our business strengths while continuing to lead a significant internal transformation to strengthen our business model. We plan to achieve our business strategy by focusing on the following strategic initiatives:
Profitability
We are focused on improving our overall profitability through revenue-management strategies to price and position our products optimally and most effectively. This includes improving our gross margins by increasing economies of scale with our smartwatches, re-negotiating pricing with our suppliers, and further reducing our supply chain costs. We are also focused on lowering our base expenses by leveraging lower sales with lower variable expenses and by achieving organizational efficiencies through our New World Fossil initiatives. We continue to close our low-performing stores and exit unprofitable businesses as we improve our net income and working capital and reduce our outstanding debt position.
Innovation
We are driving innovation across every aspect of our business. We continue to form new partnerships with leading brands, which helps us leverage our vertical structure, size and scale. We are bringing new and innovative functions to smartwatches across both our hybrid and display platforms—as well as expanding our distribution and increasing our addressable market. We are also driving innovations in traditional watches and our accessory categories through our investment in R&D and data analytics.
E-commerce and Digitalization
We are investing in our digital infrastructure and commerce capabilities across our owned and third-party e-commerce sites. We plan to continue to expand our digital capabilities for consumer insight, analytics and the use of data throughout our organization, as well as shifting to a new marketing and commerce platform to drive greater personalization and a better consumer experience.
We will continue to collaborate with our wholesale partners to optimize online performance, and we will seek out opportunities to expand our direct to consumer e-commerce business into new markets, with a focus on the Asia Pacific region. Based on the success of our digital marketing campaigns in fiscal year 2018, we intend to expand our social media and digital marketing programs in fiscal 2019 and across more global markets.
Sustainability
We care about our people, our customers, our shareholders, our communities and our planet. Our newly-launched sustainability platform, Make Time for Good, is setting the tone for our innovative efforts to make a positive social and environmental impact. We are committed to challenging the norms of the watch and accessory industry by designing our products with the future in mind, reducing our footprint, empowering women, respecting human rights, enhancing our communities and strengthening diversity.
Distribution
We have an extensive distribution network that allows us to reach a diverse global customer base. We sell our products through a range of channels including e-commerce, Company-owned retail stores, department and specialty retail stores, airlines, mass markets and concessions.
Stores
Internationally, our products are sold across approximately 150 countries worldwide through 23 Company-owned sales subsidiaries and through a network of approximately 70 independent distributors. Our products are offered on airlines and cruise ships and in international Company-owned retail stores. Our international network of Company-owned stores included 181 retail stores and 127 outlet stores as of December 29, 2018. In certain international markets, our products are also sold through licensed and franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks, as well as through owned and third-party websites. 
4

E-commerce
Our owned global e-commerce websites deliver engaging brand content, mobile-friendly experiences, and seamless integration with retail stores, including the ability to buy certain products online and pick them up in one of our retail stores and shipping consumer orders from our stores. Our websites work in conjunction with our digital marketing efforts to deliver personalized and compelling brand experiences that strengthen consumer loyalty and ultimately drive profitability. We also distribute our products through leading third-party e-commerce retailers, as well as our wholesalers’ e-commerce websites and a wide network of additional online retailers. We take a holistic approach to our e-commerce distribution to ensure that both owned and licensed brands deliver an engaging customer experience at every digital touch point.
Sourcing
The vast majority of our products are sourced internationally, with a substantial percentage of our watches and jewelry products assembled or manufactured by entities that are majority owned by us. Most watch product sourcing is coordinated through our Hong Kong subsidiary, Fossil (East) Limited ("Fossil East"). During fiscal year 2018, approximately 49% of our global watch production was assembled or sourced through wholly or majority owned factories. This vertical integration of our business allows for better flow of communication, consistent quality, product design protection and improved supply chain speed, while still allowing us to utilize non-owned production facilities for their unique capabilities and to cover production needs over internal capacities. Establishing our watch assembly facilities near the component manufacturers also allows us to operate a more efficient supply chain. In addition, although we do not have long-term contracts with our unrelated watch and accessory manufacturers, we maintain long-term relationships with several manufacturers. These relationships developed due to the significant length of time we have conducted business with the same manufacturers. We believe that we are able to exert significant operational control with regard to our principal watch assemblers because of our level of ownership and long standing relationships. In addition, we believe that the relative size of our business with non-owned watch manufacturers gives us priority within their production schedules. Furthermore, the manufacturers understand our quality standards, which allow us to produce quality products and reduce the delivery time to market, improving overall operating margins. We have also added new third-party facilities and relationships for manufacturing our wearable technology products as well as enhanced our own factories to enable assembly and production of hybrid smartwatches. Increased volume in the wearables category would allow us to further reduce costs through improved volume pricing and enable our suppliers to continue to invest in automation.
Trademarks and Patents
We use our FOSSIL, MICHELE, MISFIT, RELIC, SKAGEN and ZODIAC trademarks, as well as other trademarks, on certain watches, smartwatches, activity trackers, jewelry, leather goods and other fashion accessories in the U.S. and in a significant number of foreign countries. We also use FOSSIL, SKAGEN, WATCH STATION INTERNATIONAL®, and WSI® as trademarks on retail stores and FOSSIL, SKAGEN, WATCH STATION INTERNATIONAL, WSI, MISFIT, ZODIAC and MICHELE as trademarks on online e-commerce sites. We have taken steps to establish or provide additional protection for our trademarks by registering or applying to register our trademarks for relevant classes of products in each country where our products are sold in addition to certain foreign countries where it is our intent to market our products in the future. Each registered trademark may be renewable indefinitely, so long as we continue to use the mark in the applicable jurisdiction and make the appropriate filings when required. We aggressively protect our trademarks and trade dress and pursue infringement claims both domestically and internationally. We also pursue counterfeiters both domestically and internationally through third-party online monitoring tools and through leads generated internally, as well as through our business partners worldwide.
Patents
We continue to explore innovations in the design and assembly of our watch, smartwatch, activity tracker and related products. As a result, we have been granted, and have pending, various U.S. and international design and utility patents related to certain product designs, features, and technologies. As of December 29, 2018, none of our patents were material to our business.
Other
We rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, particularly in the wearable technology space. We strive to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with current and prospective product development partners, confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and others that may have access to our proprietary information and through the use of other security measures.
Seasonality 
5

Our business has a seasonal pattern, with a significant portion of our sales occurring during the end-of-year holiday period.
Inventory Control
We maintain inventory control systems at our facilities that enable us to track each product from the time it is shipped from our factory through shipment to our customers, the end consumer, concessions locations and websites. To facilitate this tracking, a significant number of products sold by us are pre-ticketed and bar coded. Our inventory control systems report shipping, sales and individual stock keeping unit level inventory information. We manage the retail sales process by monitoring customer sales and inventory levels of our products by product category and style, primarily through electronic data interchange. We believe that our distribution capabilities enable us to reduce inventory risk and increase flexibility in responding to the delivery requirements of our customers. We believe that our electronic data interchange efforts will continue to grow in the future as customers focus further on increasing operating efficiencies. In addition, we maintain systems that are designed to track inventory movement through our Company-owned stores. We monitor store inventory movement through review of detailed sales transaction records, which are accumulated on each store’s point-of-sale system.
Upon completion of assembly/manufacturing, the majority of our products are shipped to one of our warehousing and distribution centers in Texas, Germany or Hong Kong, from which they are shipped to subsidiary warehouses or directly to customers in selected markets. Our centralized warehouse and distribution facilities allow us to maximize our inventory management and distribution capabilities and more readily meet the varying distribution requirements placed on us by our customers at a lower cost. Our facilities in Texas and Germany are equipped with automated material handling equipment. The automated equipment and operating systems, in conjunction with the continual sampling of our outgoing orders prior to shipment, are important in maintaining the quality, accuracy, speed and reputation of our products and distribution service.
Significant Customer
No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Backlog
It is the practice of a substantial number of our customers not to confirm orders by delivering a formal purchase order until a relatively short time prior to the shipment of goods. As a result, the amount of unfilled customer orders includes confirmed orders and orders that we believe will be confirmed by delivery of a formal purchase order. A majority of such amounts represent orders that have been confirmed. The remainder of such amounts represents orders that we believe, based on industry practice and prior experience, will be confirmed in the ordinary course of business. Our backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality and the scheduling of the manufacture and shipment of our products. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments. At the end of fiscal year 2018, we had unfilled customer orders of approximately $96.2 million, compared to $74.1 million and $104.5 million at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Competition
The businesses in which we compete are highly competitive and fragmented. The current market for traditional watches can be divided into tiers ranging from lower price point watches that are typically distributed through mass market channels to luxury watches at higher price points that are typically distributed through fine watch departments of upscale department stores or upscale specialty watch and fine jewelry stores. Our watch business generally competes in these tiers with a number of established manufacturers, importers and distributors, including Armitron, Citizen, Gucci, Guess?, Kenneth Cole, LVMH Group, Movado, Raymond Weil, Seiko, Swatch, Swiss Army, TAG Heuer and Timex. In addition, our leather goods, sunglasses, and jewelry businesses compete with a large number of established companies that have significant experience developing, marketing and distributing such products. Our competitors include distributors that import watches and accessories from abroad, U.S. companies that have established foreign manufacturing relationships and companies that produce accessories domestically.
We believe the risk of significant new competitors for traditional watches is mitigated to some extent by barriers to entry such as high startup costs and the development of long-term relationships with customers and manufacturing sources. However, in the expanding wearable technology industry, we face competition from technology brands such as Apple and Samsung, from fitness brands such as Fitbit, as well as from many established traditional watch manufacturers that have launched wearable technology products. As this industry evolves and grows, there will likely be increased competition as well. However, we believe our design, branding, significant scale and distribution are strong competitive advantages.
6

Although the level and nature of competition varies among our product categories and geographic regions, we compete on the basis of style and technical features, price, value, quality, brand name, advertising, marketing, distribution and customer service. Our ability to identify and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences (including wearable technology), to maintain existing relationships and develop new relationships with manufacturing sources, to deliver quality merchandise in a timely manner, to manage the retail sales process, and to continue to integrate technology into our business model are important factors in our ability to compete. Our distinctive business model of owning the distribution in many key markets and offering a globally recognized portfolio of proprietary and licensed products allows for many competitive advantages over smaller, regional or local competitors. This allows us to bypass the local distributor's cost structure in certain countries, resulting in more competitively priced products, while also generating higher product and operating margins.
Governmental Regulation
Imports and Import Restrictions
Most of our products are assembled or manufactured overseas. As a result, the U.S. and countries in which our products are sourced or sold may from time to time modify existing or impose new quotas, duties (including anti-dumping or countervailing duties), tariffs or other restrictions in a manner that adversely affects us. For example, our products imported to the U.S. are subject to U.S. customs duties, and in the ordinary course of our business, we may from time to time be subject to claims by the U.S. Customs Service for duties and other charges. Factors that may influence the modification or imposition of these restrictions include the determination by the U.S. Trade Representative that a country has denied adequate intellectual property rights or fair and equitable market access to U.S. firms that rely on intellectual property, trade disputes between the U.S. and a country that leads to withdrawal of "most favored nation" status for that country and economic and political changes within a country that are viewed unfavorably by the U.S. government. We cannot predict the effect these events would have on our operations, if any, especially in light of the concentration of our assembly and manufacturing operations in Hong Kong and China.
General
We are subject to laws regarding customs, tax, employment, privacy, truth-in-advertising, consumer product safety, zoning and occupancy and other laws and regulations that regulate and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of consumer products and our corporate, retail and distribution operations.
Compliance and Trade
Code of Conduct for Manufacturers
We are committed to ethical and responsible conduct in all of our operations and respect for the rights of all individuals. We strive to ensure that human rights are upheld for all workers involved in our supply chain, and that individuals experience safe, fair and non-discriminatory working conditions. In addition, we are committed to compliance with applicable environmental requirements and are committed to seeing that all of our products are manufactured and distributed in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We expect that our business partners will share these commitments, which we enforce through our Manufacturer Code.
Our Manufacturer Code specifically requires our manufacturers to not use child, forced or involuntary labor and to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We provide training to our factories related to our Manufacturer Code and the applicable laws in the country in which the factory is located. The training provides the factories with a more in-depth explanation of our Manufacturer Code.
In addition to the contractual obligation, we evaluate our suppliers' compliance with our Manufacturer Code through audits conducted both by our employees and third-party compliance auditing firms. In most cases, the audits are announced. If we believe that a supplier is failing to live up to the standards of our Manufacturer Code, we may terminate the supplier or provide the supplier with an opportunity to remedy the non-compliance through the implementation of a corrective action plan. For those suppliers on a corrective action plan, we will work with the supplier as necessary to help them understand the non-compliance and provide advice on how to remedy the non-compliance. We conduct a follow-up audit to confirm compliance after the implementation of the corrective action plan. Should the supplier continue to fail to meet our standards, we may seek to eliminate such supplier from our supply chain.
7

Quality Control
Our quality control program attempts to ensure that our products meet the standards established by our product development staff. Samples of products are inspected by us prior to placing orders with factories to ensure compliance with our technical design specifications. We also typically inspect "top of production" prototypes of each product before commencing production. The operations of our Hong Kong and Chinese factories are monitored on a periodic basis by Fossil East, and the operations of our Swiss factories are monitored on a periodic basis by Montres Antima SA, one of our foreign operating subsidiaries. Substantially all of our watches, jewelry and certain of our other accessories are inspected by personnel of Fossil East or by the assembly/manufacturing facility prior to shipment to our distribution centers. Final inspections, on a sampling basis, occur when the products are received in our distribution centers. We believe that our policy of inspecting our products at the assembly/manufacturing facility, upon receipt at our distribution facilities and prior to shipment to our customers is important to maintain the quality, consistency and reputation of our products.
Trade
Our warehouse and distribution facilities in Texas operate in a special purpose sub-zone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board. This sub-zone provides the following economic and operational advantages to us: (i) we do not have to pay duty on imported merchandise until it leaves the sub-zone and enters the U.S. market; (ii) we do not have to pay any U.S. duty on merchandise if the imported merchandise is subsequently shipped to locations outside the U.S.; and (iii) we do not have to pay local property tax on inventory located within the sub-zone.
Employees
As of December 29, 2018, we employed approximately 10,800 persons, including approximately 6,600 persons employed by our foreign operating subsidiaries.
None of our domestic or foreign-based employees are represented by a trade union. However, certain European-based employees are represented by work councils, which include certain of our current employees who negotiate with management on behalf of all the employees. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our working relationship with our employees and work councils to be good.
