The Company
 Flowers Foods, Inc. (references to “we,” “our,” “us,” the “company,” “Flowers” or “Flowers Foods” ) was founded in 1919 as a Georgia corporation when two brothers — William Howard and Joseph Hampton Flowers — opened Flowers Baking Company in Thomasville, Georgia. Flowers’ operating strategy from the beginning was to invest in efficient and technologically advanced bakeries, offer excellent baked foods, build strong brands, provide extraordinary service to customers, offer a workplace that fosters a team spirit, develop innovations to improve the business, and grow through strategic acquisitions. 
 Flowers is focused on opportunities for growth within the baked foods category and seeks to have its products available wherever bakery foods are sold or consumed — whether in homes, supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants, fast food outlets, institutions, or vending machines. The company produces a wide range of breads, buns, rolls, snack cakes, and tortillas.   
 Project Centennial
 In June 2016, the company launched Project Centennial, an enterprise-wide business and operational review to evaluate opportunities to streamline our operations, drive efficiencies, and invest in strategic capabilities that we believe will strengthen our competitive position and drive profitable revenue growth. Based upon the results of this review, Flowers has begun executing on four primary strategic initiatives:

• | reinvigorate the core business – invest in the growth and innovation of our core brands, streamline our brand and product portfolio, improve trade promotion management, and strengthen our partnership with distributors so they can grow their businesses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | capitalize on product adjacencies – greater focus on growing segments of the bakery category, such as foodservice, in-store bakery, impulse items, and healthy snacking;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduce costs to fuel growth – reduce complexity and better leverage scale to lower costs; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | develop leading capabilities – invest in capabilities to become a more centralized and analytics-focused company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The company implemented a plan to transition to these primary strategies beginning in fiscal 2017, with the transition intended to be completed by fiscal 2021. By executing on Project Centennial, the company expects to deliver on its stated long-term goals of sales growth in the range of 2% to 4% and EBITDA margins in the range of 12% to 14%.  The company defines EBITDA as earnings from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other items that impact comparability.
 In fiscal 2019 and beyond, Flowers expects to fully realize the benefits of a lower-cost operating model, stronger brand architecture, and increased strategic investments. These benefits are expected to drive sales growth and EBITDA margins to the upper end of our stated long-term goals discussed above.
 During fiscal 2016, we completed the diagnostic phase of Project Centennial, which identified the aforementioned four strategic initiatives and outlined the timeline and financial targets described above.
 During fiscal 2017, the company began the implementation phase of Project Centennial, and made significant progress on several initiatives, including  streamlining our brand assortment in key retail categories, reducing spend on purchased goods and services, closing a Warehouse Segment snack cake plant, hiring a chief marketing officer, completing the VSIP and other workforce reductions, and beginning to transition to the company’s new organization structure, which establishes two business units (“BUs”), Fresh Packaged Bread and Snacking/Specialty, and realigns key leadership roles.
 In fiscal 2018, we continued to execute on key strategic initiatives, including the following accomplishments during the year:
  
• | Realized continued growth from new product introductions: Nature’s Own Perfectly Crafted breads, a line of artisan-inspired, thick-sliced bakery breads, and Dave’s Killer Bread bagels and English muffins.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquired Canyon Bakehouse, LLC (“Canyon”), a privately held, leading producer of gluten-free bakery foods.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conducted a foundational consumer research study to inform and accelerate product innovation and engaged a leading consumer-focused advertising agency.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4


 
• | Appointed a chief operating officer to enhance execution and accountability.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Refined its organizational structure to better align operating functions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Activated a trade promotion management system to increase promotional effectiveness, enhance price realizations, and improve profitability.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Realized total gross savings above the upper end of the $38-million to $48-million target for fiscal 2018, primarily through a more efficient organizational structure and reduced spending on purchased goods and services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Added a high-speed bun line to a Pennsylvania bakery and closed an inefficient bakery in Vermont.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implemented working capital policies that improved the cash conversion cycle and generated incremental cash flow.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During 2018, the company continued to transition to an enhanced organizational structure announced in the second quarter of 2017.  The new organizational structure is designed to emphasize brand growth and innovation in line with a national branded food company, drive enhanced accountability, reduce costs, strengthen long-term strategy and provide greater focus on the strategic initiatives under Project Centennial.  The company anticipates full implementation to be completed at the beginning of fiscal 2019. The company continues to manage the business and report segment information based on our current segments, the DSD Segment and the Warehouse Segment.
 The new organizational structure establishes two BUs, Fresh Packaged Bread and Snacking/Specialty, and realigns key leadership roles. The new structure also provides for centralized marketing, sales, supply chain, shared-services/administrative, and corporate strategy functions.  On July 2, 2018, the company announced the creation of the COO position.  This role is responsible for executing the company’s strategies under Project Centennial, as well as, overseeing the BUs, supply chain, sales, corporate strategy and ventures, and communications.  We continue to explore additional opportunities to streamline our core operations, but as of December 29, 2018, we cannot estimate the costs to be incurred related to these initiatives.  
 The company previously announced in the third quarter of 2017 a voluntary employee separation incentive plan (the “VSIP”) as part of its effort to restructure, streamline operations, and better position the company for profitable growth.  Costs associated with the VSIP were recorded in the company’s results of operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and the VSIP was substantially completed as of the end of fiscal 2017.  Payments of $24.2 million for the VSIP were paid during fiscal 2018.
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the company provided targets for gross cost savings associated with the primary cost savings programs under Project Centennial: the above-mentioned initiative to reduce spending on purchased goods and services, a supply chain optimization plan, and the new organizational structure described above.  By the end of fiscal 2018, the company targeted cumulative gross cost savings under these three programs of $70 million to $80 million, of which approximately $32 million was realized in fiscal 2017 and in excess of $48 million was realized in fiscal 2018.
 Segments
 We currently manage our business by product delivery method.  Our two operating segments reflect our two distinct methods of delivering products to the market:  
 Direct-Store-Delivery Segment (the “DSD Segment”)
  
• | Produces fresh breads, buns, rolls, tortillas and snack cakes sold primarily by a network of independent distributors to retail and foodservice customers in the following areas of the U.S.: East, South, Southwest, West Coast, and select markets in the Midwest, Nevada, and Colorado.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Has a 39-bakery network with a highly developed reciprocal baking system (where bakeries can produce for its market and that of other bakeries within the direct-store-delivery (“DSD” network), which results in long and efficient production runs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Major DSD Segment brands include Nature’s Own, Dave’s Killer Bread, Tastykake, Wonder, and Cobblestone Bread Company.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5


Warehouse Delivery Segment (the “Warehouse Segment”)
  
• | Produces fresh snack cakes and frozen breads and rolls.
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Delivers its products fresh or frozen to customers’ warehouses nationwide via contract carriers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Major brands include Mrs. Freshley’s, Alpine Valley Bread, and European Bakers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The table below presents the sales, percent of total sales, and the number of plants by each segment:
 
 
Segment | Sales | | Percent of total sales | | Plants
------------------+-------+-----------+------------------------+-----+-------
DSD Segment | $ | 3,340,047 | | 85 | % | 39
Warehouse Segment | $ | 611,805 | | 15 | % | 8 
Consolidated | $ | 3,951,852 | | 100 | % | 47

 See Note 25, Segment Reporting, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for more detailed financial information about our segments.  Our brands are among the best known in the baking industry. Many of our DSD Segment’s brands have a major presence in the product categories in which they compete. They have a leading share of fresh packaged branded sales measured in both dollars and units in the major metropolitan areas we serve in Southern markets.
 On May 3, 2017, the company announced, as part of Project Centennial, an enhanced organizational structure designed to provide greater focus on the company’s strategic objectives, emphasize brand growth and innovation in line with a national branded food company, drive enhanced accountability, reduce costs, and strengthen long-term strategy.  The new structure also provides for centralized marketing, sales, supply chain, shared-services/administrative, and corporate strategy functions, each with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.  The transition to the new structure will be completed early in fiscal 2019.  Management will continue to review financial information for the DSD Segment and Warehouse Segment until the new organizational structure is fully implemented.  Based on the preliminary segment reporting analysis, we expect changes to the organization structure to have a significant impact on our segment reporting. We expect to complete our segment reporting analysis in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.    
 Operating Strategies
 Flowers Foods has focused on developing and refining operating strategies to create competitive advantages in the marketplace. We believe these operating strategies help us achieve our long-term objectives and work to build value for our shareholders. Put simply, our strategies are to:

• | Grow Sales. We develop new and core markets through new customers, new products, strong brands, and acquisitions. We have a three-pronged strategy for growing sales through market expansions, core markets, and acquisitions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest Wisely. We use technology and efficiencies to be the low-cost producer of delicious bakery foods. We invest to improve the effectiveness of our bakeries, distribution networks, and information systems. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bake Smart. We innovate to improve processes, enhance quality, reduce costs, and conserve resources. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Give Extraordinary Service. We go beyond the expected to meet our customers’ needs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Appreciate the Team. We respect every individual, embrace diversity, and promote the career growth of our team members. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Strengths and core competencies
  
• | Seasoned Team – Executive management team with an average of more than 20 years of baking industry experience
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Brands – More than $3.3 billion at retail in total branded retail sales, including vending
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Geographic Reach – Fresh products available to more than 85% of the U.S. population; frozen products available nationally
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Financial Position – Driven by solid cash flows
--+-------------------------------------------------------

We aim to achieve consistent and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by focusing on improvements in the operating results of our existing bakeries and, after detailed analysis, acquiring companies and properties that add value to the company. We believe this strategy has resulted in consistent and sustainable growth that builds value for our shareholders.
 We regularly articulate our core business strategies to the investment community and internally to our team members, including long-term (five-year) goals. Compensation and bonus programs are linked to the company’s short and long-term goals. The majority of our employees participate in an annual formula-driven, performance-based cash bonus program. In addition, certain employees participate in a long-term incentive program that includes grants of various types of common stock awards. We believe these incentive programs provide both a short and long-term goal for our most senior management team and aligns their interests with those of our shareholders. 
 Grow Sales
 This strategy encompasses specific efforts for growth through acquisitions, market expansions, product innovation, and core markets.  As a leading U.S. baker, our products are available to consumers through traditional supermarkets, foodservice distributors, convenience stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, wholesalers, casual dining and quick-serve restaurants, schools, hospitals, dollar stores, and vending machines. To enhance our ability to grow sales, we develop bakery foods that meet changing consumer needs and preferences using market research and the strength of our well-established brands. We maintain and strengthen our brands in both existing and new markets by focusing on consistent product quality, a broad and diverse product line, and exceptional customer service. We expand our geographic reach through strategic acquisitions and by expanding the market reach of our existing bakeries. We believe our growth strategy has been successful, as evidenced by our sales compound average annual growth rate of 1.1% over the last five years. 
Acquisitions
 Acquisitions have been an important component of our growth strategy. Since our initial public offering in 1968, we have made more than 100 acquisitions. Since 2003, we have completed 17 acquisitions that, in the aggregate, added approximately $2.1 billion in annual revenue. Our primary acquisition targets have historically been independent/regional baking companies in areas of the country where our fresh products have not had access to those markets. See Note 11, Acquisition, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for more details of each of the acquisitions described below.
 Canyon Bakehouse Acquisition (2018)
 On December 14, 2018, the company completed the acquisition of Canyon.  Prior to acquisition, almost 90% of Canyon’s sales were distributed frozen through natural, specialty, grocery, and mass retailers around the country.  The company intends to continue distributing Canyon’s gluten-free products frozen through our Warehouse Segment and expand fresh distribution through our DSD Segment.  This results in Canyon being included in both segments for financial reporting purposes.
Core Markets
 Core markets are those served by our DSD Segment for more than five years. These are markets where our brands are established. Our primary growth strategy for core markets is to increase brand relevance. We strive to develop innovative, new products for both retail and foodservice customers that will drive excitement and consumers to our brands and products. In addition, in conjunction with the independent distributors, we focus on continually building relationships with both new and potential retail and foodservice customers, which helps grow sales.
Expansion Markets
 Expansion markets are defined as new DSD Segment markets entered within the last five fiscal years. In 2011, we announced a DSD market expansion goal to serve a geographical area reaching at least 75% of the U.S. population by 2016. At the end of fiscal 2016, we had exceeded that goal and currently serve more than 85% of the U.S. population.  
 Our market expansion efforts are driven by our bakery subsidiaries.  They accomplish this by reaching out to new and existing retail and foodservice customers in the new territory and expanding the DSD model by creating new territories and new independent distributor partnerships.

Invest Wisely and Bake Smart
 Throughout our history, we have devoted significant resources to automate our bakeries and improve our distribution capabilities. We believe these investments have made us one of the most efficient, low-cost producers of packaged bakery products in the United States. We believe our capital investments yield valuable long-term benefits, such as more consistent product quality and greater production volume at a lower cost per unit.
 From 2014 through 2018, we invested $450.9 million in capital projects. We believe our annual capital investments have given us a competitive edge and we are committed to maintaining that advantage by investing in new technologies and improved processes.
 We have established a reciprocal baking system that allows us to shift production among our DSD Segment bakeries. Because of this system, we have the flexibility to meet changing market needs, can respond effectively to hurricanes and other wide-spread natural disasters, and be a low-cost producer and marketer of a full line of bakery products both regionally and nationally. For efficient movement of products from bakery to market, we use company-owned and leased warehouses and distribution centers.
 We believe our company also invests wisely and bakes smart by:
  
• | Engaging in research and development to increase brand relevance, improve the quality of existing products, and improve production processes and techniques.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing and evaluating new processing techniques for both current and proposed product lines.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving the efficiency and accuracy of our shipping logistics. We have been installing a paperless, user-directed automated shipping system at our bakeries that uses barcode labels, displays, and door scanners. The system streamlines the finished goods product flow, provides for greater accountability of finished goods received and shipped, improves order fulfillment, and minimizes shortage costs. At the end of fiscal 2018, we had installed this automated shipping system in the majority of our bakeries. We will continue to implement the system throughout the remainder of fiscal 2019 and intend to have it fully implemented by fiscal 2020. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Give Extraordinary Service
 When it comes to our retail and foodservice partnerships, our strategy is simple: Go beyond the expected. Our bakery, sales, and national account teams forge strong business relationships built on providing the best quality products at the best price when and where our customers need them. Focusing on extraordinary service helps grow sales in both core and new markets. Also critical to this strategy within our DSD Segment is the professionalism and service provided by the independent distributors who provide daily customer service and build strong retail and foodservice relationships.
Appreciate the Team
 We strive to treat all our team members and associates with respect and dignity and work to maintain good relationships and open communication. We are committed to equal employment opportunities and operating our facilities under all federal and state employment laws and regulations. In addition, our subsidiaries provide:

• | fair and equitable compensation and a balanced program of benefits;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | working conditions that promote employees’ health and safety;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | training opportunities that encourage professional development; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ways for team members to discuss concerns through an open door policy, peer review program, and anonymous toll-free hotline.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We employ approximately 9,200 people. Approximately 1,100 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

The table below presents our sales by channel for fiscal 2018 on a consolidated basis (internal sales data warehouse – “SDW”, amounts not compute due to rounding):
 

Marketing
 We support our key brands with an advertising and marketing effort that reaches out to consumers through electronic and in-store coupons, social media (such as Facebook and Twitter), digital media (including e-newsletters to consumers), websites (our brand sites and third-party sites), event and sports marketing, on-package promotional offers and sweepstakes, and print advertising. When appropriate, we may join other sponsors with promotional tie-ins. We often focus our marketing efforts on specific products and holidays, such as hamburger and hot dog bun sales during Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and Labor Day, and snack cakes for specific seasons.
 10


Customers
 Our top 10 customers in fiscal 2018 accounted for 50.3% of sales. During fiscal 2018, our largest customer, Walmart/Sam’s Club, represented 20.3% of the company’s sales. The loss of, or a material negative change in our relationship with, Walmart/Sam’s Club or any other major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business. Walmart/Sam’s Club was the only customer to account for 10.0% or more of our sales during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.
 Fresh baked foods’ customers include mass merchandisers, supermarkets and other retailers, restaurants, quick-serve chains, food wholesalers, institutions, dollar stores, and vending companies. We also sell returned and surplus product through a system of thrift stores. The company currently operates 286 such stores, and reported sales of $71.4 million during fiscal 2018 from these outlets.
 Our Warehouse Segment supplies national and regional restaurants, institutions and foodservice distributors, and retail in-store bakeries with breads and rolls. It also sells packaged bakery products to wholesale distributors for ultimate sale to a wide variety of food outlets. It sells packaged snack cakes primarily to customers who distribute the product nationwide through multiple channels of distribution, including mass merchandisers, supermarkets, vending outlets and convenience stores. In certain circumstances, we enter into co-packing arrangements with retail customers or other food companies, some of which are competitors.
 Distribution
 Distributing fresh bakery foods through a DSD model that involves aggregating order levels and delivering products from bakeries to independent distributors for sale and direct delivery to customer stores. The independent distributors are responsible for ordering products, stocking shelves, maintaining special displays, and developing and maintaining good customer relations to ensure adequate inventory and removing unsold goods.
 The company has sold the majority of the distribution rights for these territories to independent distributors under long-term financing arrangements. Independent distributors, highly motivated by financial incentives from their distribution rights ownership, strive to increase sales by offering outstanding service and merchandising. Independent distributors have the opportunity to benefit directly from the enhanced value of their distribution rights resulting from higher branded sales volume.
 Our DSD model is comprised of three types of territories.  Independent distributors who own the rights to distribute certain brands of our fresh packaged bakery foods in defined geographic markets. Company-owned and operated territories with the distribution rights that are classified as available for sale and company owned and operated territories with the distribution rights that are classified as held and used.  The table below presents the approximate number of territories used by the company on December 29, 2018:
 
 
Type of territory | Number of territories | 
-----------------------------------------------+-----------------------+------
Independent distributor distribution rights | | 5,881
Company owned classified as available for sale | | 140 
Company owned classified as held and used | | 90 
Total territories | | 6,111

 The company has developed proprietary software on the hand-held computers that independent distributors use for ordering, sales transactions, and to manage their businesses. The company provides these hand-held computers to the independent distributors and charges them an administrative fee for their use and other administrative services.  This fee is recognized as a reduction to the company’s selling, distribution and administrative expenses.  Our proprietary software permits distributors to track and communicate inventory data to bakeries and to calculate recommended order levels based on historical sales data and recent trends. These orders are electronically transmitted to the appropriate bakery on a nightly basis. We believe this system assists us in minimizing returns of unsold goods.  The fees collected for each of the last three fiscal years were as follows (amounts in thousands):
 
 
Year | Fees collected | 
------------+----------------+------
Fiscal 2018 | $ | 7,399
Fiscal 2017 | $ | 6,965
Fiscal 2016 | $ | 6,544

 11


In addition to hand-held computers, we maintain an information technology (“IT”) platform that allows us to track sales, product returns, and profitability by selling location, bakery, day, and other criteria. The system provides us with daily, on-line access to sales and gross margin reports, allowing us to make prompt operational adjustments when appropriate. It also permits us to better forecast sales and improve independent distributors’ in-store product ordering by customer. This IT platform is integral to our hand-held computers.
 We also use scan-based trading technology (referred to as “pay by scan” or “PBS”) to track and monitor sales and inventories more effectively. PBS allows the independent distributors to bypass the often lengthy product check-in at retail stores, which gives them more time to service customers and merchandise products. PBS also benefits retailers, who only pay suppliers for what they actually sell, or what is scanned at checkout. During the last three fiscal years, PBS sales were as follows (amounts in thousands):
 
 
Year | PBS sales | 
------------+-----------+----------
Fiscal 2018 | $ | 1,729,429
Fiscal 2017 | $ | 1,390,974
Fiscal 2016 | $ | 1,273,660

 Our Warehouse Segment distributes a portion of our packaged bakery snack products from a central distribution facility located near our Crossville, Tennessee snack cake bakery. We believe this centralized distribution method allows us to achieve both production and distribution efficiencies. Products coming from different bakeries are then cross-docked and shipped directly to customers’ warehouses nationwide. Our frozen bread and roll products are shipped to various outside freezer facilities for distribution to our customers.
 Intellectual Property
 We own a number of trademarks, trade names, patents, and licenses. The company also sells products under franchised and licensed trademarks and trade names that we do not own (Sunbeam, Bunny, and Sara Lee – only in California – among others). We consider all of our trademarks and trade names important to our business since we use them to build strong brand awareness and consumer loyalty.
Raw Materials
 Our primary baking ingredients are flour, sweeteners, shortening, yeast and water. We also use paper products, such as corrugated cardboard, films and plastics to package our bakery foods. We strive to maintain diversified sources for all of our baking ingredients and packaging products.  In addition, we are dependent on natural gas or propane as fuel for firing our ovens. 
 Commodities, such as our baking ingredients, periodically experience price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage the impact of such volatility in raw material prices, but some organic and specialty ingredients do not offer the same hedging opportunities to reduce the impact of price volatility.  Any decrease in the supply available under these agreements and instruments could increase the effective price of these raw materials to us and significantly impact our earnings.
 Regulations
 As a producer and marketer of food items, our operations are subject to regulation by various federal governmental agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”).  We also are subject to the regulations of various state agencies, with respect to production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, labor, and local regulations regarding the licensing of bakeries and the enforcement of state standards and facility inspections.  Under various statutes and regulations, these federal and state agencies prescribe requirements and establish standards for quality, purity, and labeling.  Failure to comply with one or more regulatory requirements could result in a variety of sanctions, including monetary fines or compulsory withdrawal of products from store shelves.  In August 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor (the “Department”) notified the company that it was scheduled for a compliance review under the Fair Labor Standards Act.  On November 5, 2018, the company was advised by the Department that the compliance review has been closed.
 Advertising of our businesses is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, and we are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
 12


The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the company’s business.  We believe that we are currently in material compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.  
 Our operations, like those of similar businesses, are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air and water quality and underground fuel storage tanks, as well as other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment.  The company is not a party to any material proceedings arising under these laws and regulations.  We believe compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect the Consolidated Financial Statements or the competitive position of the company.  The company is currently in substantial compliance with all material environmental laws and regulations affecting the company and its properties.
 Competitive Overview
 The U.S. market for fresh and frozen bakery products is estimated at $36 billion at retail. This category is intensely competitive and has experienced significant change in the last several years. From a national standpoint, Flowers Foods is currently the second largest company in the U.S. fresh baking industry based on market share as presented in the following chart (amounts may not compute due to rounding):
 
The current competitive landscape for breads and rolls in the U.S. baking industry now consists of Bimbo Bakeries USA, Flowers Foods, and Campbell Soup Company (Pepperidge Farm) along with smaller independent regional bakers, local bakeries, and retailer-owned bakeries. 
 There are a number of smaller regional bakers in the U.S. Some of these do not enjoy the competitive advantages of larger operations, including greater brand awareness and economies of scale in purchasing, distribution, production, information technology, advertising and marketing. However, size alone is not sufficient to ensure success in our industry. The company faces significant competition from regional and independent bakeries in certain geographic areas.
 Competition in the baking industry continues to be driven by a number of factors. These include the ability to serve consolidated retail and foodservice customers, generational changes in family-owned businesses, and competitors’ promotional efforts on branded bread and store brands.
