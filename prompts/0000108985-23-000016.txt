Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 
The York Water Company (the “Company”) is the oldest investor-owned water utility in the United States and is duly organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  The Company has operated continuously since 1816.  The primary business of the Company is to impound, purify to meet or exceed safe drinking water standards and distribute water.  The Company also owns and operates three wastewater collection systems and eight wastewater collection and treatment systems.  The Company operates within its franchised water and wastewater territory, which covers portions of 54 municipalities within three counties in south-central Pennsylvania.  The Company is regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, or PPUC, for both water and wastewater in the areas of billing, payment procedures, dispute processing, terminations, service territory, debt and equity financing and rate setting.  The Company must obtain PPUC approval before changing any practices associated with the aforementioned areas.
 
Water service is supplied through the Company’s own distribution system.  The Company obtains the bulk of its water supply for its primary system for York and Adams Counties from both the South Branch and East Branch of the Codorus Creek, which together have an average daily flow of 73.0 million gallons from a combined watershed area of approximately 117 square miles.  The Company has two reservoirs on this primary system, Lake Williams and Lake Redman, which together hold up to approximately 2.2 billion gallons of water.  The Company supplements these reservoirs with a 15-mile pipeline from the Susquehanna River to Lake Redman which provides access to an additional supply of 12.0 million gallons of untreated water per day.  The Company obtains its water supply for its system for Franklin County from the Roxbury Dam on the Conodoguinet Creek, which has an average daily flow of approximately 26.0 million gallons from a watershed area of approximately 33 square miles.  The Company has a reservoir on this system which holds up to approximately 330 million gallons of water.  The Company also owns eleven wells which are capable of providing a safe yield of approximately 637,000 gallons per day to supply water to the customers of its groundwater satellite systems in York and Adams Counties.  As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s average daily availability was 40.8 million gallons, and average daily consumption was approximately 21.1 million gallons.  The Company’s service territory had an estimated population of 208,000 as of December 31, 2022.  Industry within the Company’s service territory is diversified, manufacturing such items as fixtures and furniture, electrical machinery, food products, paper, ordnance units, textile products, air conditioning systems, laundry detergent, barbells, and motorcycles.
 
The Company’s water business is somewhat dependent on weather conditions, particularly the amount and timing of precipitation.  Revenues are particularly vulnerable to weather conditions in the summer months.  Prolonged periods of hot and dry weather generally cause increased water usage for watering lawns, washing cars, and keeping golf courses and sports fields irrigated.  Conversely, prolonged periods of dry weather could lead to drought restrictions from governmental authorities.  Despite the Company’s adequate water supply, customers may be required to cut back water usage under such drought restrictions which would negatively impact revenues.  The Company has addressed some of this vulnerability by instituting minimum customer charges which are intended to cover fixed costs of operations under all likely weather conditions.
 
The Company’s business does not require large amounts of working capital and is not dependent on any single customer or a very few customers for a material portion of its business.  Increases in revenues are generally dependent on the Company’s ability to obtain rate increases from the PPUC in a timely manner and in adequate amounts and to increase volumes of water sold through increased consumption and increases in the number of customers served.  The Company continuously looks for water and wastewater acquisition and expansion opportunities both within and outside its current service territory as well as additional opportunities to enter into bulk water contracts with municipalities and other entities to supply water.
 
The Company has agreements with several municipalities to provide billing and collection services.  The Company also has a service line protection program on a targeted basis in order to further diversify its business.  Under this optional program, customers pay a fixed monthly fee, and the Company will repair or replace damaged customer service lines, as needed, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount.  The Company continues to review and consider opportunities to expand both initiatives.

Competition
 
 As a regulated utility, the Company operates within an exclusive franchised territory that is substantially free from direct competition with other public utilities, municipalities, and other entities.  Although the Company has been granted an exclusive franchise for each of its existing community water and wastewater systems, the ability of the Company to expand or acquire new service territories may be affected by currently unknown competitors obtaining franchises to surrounding systems by application or acquisition.  These competitors may include other investor-owned utilities, nearby municipally-owned utilities and sometimes competition from strategic or financial purchasers seeking to enter or expand in the water and wastewater industry.  The addition of new service territory and the acquisition of other utilities are generally subject to review and approval by the PPUC.
Water and Wastewater Quality and Environmental Regulations
 
Provisions of water and wastewater service are subject to regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act and related state laws, and under federal and state regulations issued under these laws.  In addition, the Company is subject to federal and state laws and other regulations relating to solid waste disposal, dam safety and other aspects of its operations.
 
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act establishes criteria and procedures for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, to develop national quality standards.  Regulations issued under the Act, and its amendments, set standards on the amount of certain contaminants allowable in drinking water.  Current requirements are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations or financial condition as it already meets or exceeds standards.  In the future, the Company may be required to change its method of treating drinking water and may incur additional capital investments if new regulations become effective.
 
Under the requirements of the Pennsylvania Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, or DEP, regulates the quality of the finished water supplied to customers.  The DEP requires the Company to submit monthly reports showing the results of daily bacteriological and other chemical and physical analyses. As part of this requirement, the Company conducts over 70,000 laboratory tests annually.  Management believes that the Company complies with the standards established by the agency under the SDWA.  The DEP assists the Company by regulating discharges into the Company’s watershed area to prevent and eliminate pollution.
 
The federal Groundwater Rule establishes protections against microbial pathogens in community water supplies.  This rule requires additional testing of water from well sources, and under certain circumstances requires demonstration and maintenance of effective disinfection.  The Company holds public water supply permits issued by the DEP, which establishes the groundwater source operating conditions for its wells, including demonstrated 4-log treatment of viruses.  All of the groundwater satellite systems operated by the Company are in compliance with the federal Groundwater Rule.
 
The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams, and groundwater.  The Company complies with this Act by obtaining and maintaining all required permits and approvals for discharges from its water and wastewater facilities and by satisfying all conditions and regulatory requirements associated with the permits.
 
The DEP monitors the quality of wastewater discharge effluent under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES.  The Company submits monthly reports to the DEP showing the results of its daily effluent monitoring and removal of sludge and biosolids.  The Company is not aware of any significant environmental remediation costs necessary from the handling and disposal of waste material from its wastewater operations.

Lead and copper may enter drinking water primarily through plumbing materials.  The Company is required to comply with the Lead and Copper Rule established by the EPA and administered by the DEP.  The Company must monitor drinking water at customer taps for compliance with this rule.  If lead concentrations exceed an action level, the Company must undertake a number of additional actions to control corrosion, inform the public about steps they should take to protect their health and may be required to replace lead service lines under its control.  The Company is currently in compliance with standards under the Lead and Copper Rule.
 
The DEP and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, or SRBC, regulate the amount of water withdrawn from streams in the watershed to assure that sufficient quantities are available to meet the needs of the Company and other regulated users.  Through its Division of Dam Safety, the DEP regulates the operation and maintenance of the Company’s impounding dams.  The Company routinely inspects its dams and prepares annual reports of their condition as required by DEP regulations.  The DEP reviews these reports and inspects the Company’s dams.  The DEP most recently inspected some of the Company’s dams in 2022.
 
Since 1980, the DEP has required any new dam to have a spillway that is capable of passing the design flood without overtopping the dam.  The design flood is either the Probable Maximum Flood, or PMF, or some fraction of it, depending on the size and location of the dam.  PMF is very conservative and is calculated using the most severe combination of meteorological and hydrologic conditions reasonably possible in the watershed area of a dam.
 
The Company engaged a professional engineer to analyze the spillway capacities at the Lake Williams and Lake Redman dams and validate the DEP’s recommended flood design for the dams.  Management presented the results of the study to the DEP in December 2004, and DEP then requested that the Company submit a proposed schedule for the actions to address the spillway capacities.  Thereafter, the Company retained an engineering firm to prepare preliminary designs for increasing the spillway capacities to pass the PMF through armoring the dams with roller compacted concrete.  Management met with the DEP on a regular basis to review the preliminary design and discuss scheduling, permitting, and construction requirements including their concern regarding the stability of the Lake Williams spillway in light of current design standards.  The Company completed the final design and the permitting process to armor and replace the spillway of the Lake Williams dam and began construction in 2022 at a total cost of approximately $39 million.  The Lake Redman dam will be reviewed following the completion of the work on the Lake Williams dam.
 
Capital expenditures and operating costs required as a result of water quality standards and environmental requirements have been traditionally recognized by state public utility commissions as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates.  The capital expenditures currently required as a result of water quality standards and environmental requirements have been budgeted in the Company’s capital program and represent less than 15% of its expected total capital expenditures over the next five years.  The Company is currently in compliance with wastewater environmental standards and does not anticipate any major capital expenditures for its current wastewater business.
 
Growth
 
(All dollar amounts are stated in thousands of dollars)
 
The Company continues to grow its number of customers and distribution facilities.
 
The growth in the number of customers is due primarily to the acquisition of water and wastewater systems and organic growth. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company increased its number of customers from 73,144 to 76,731.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Acquisitions and Growth” for a discussion of the Company’s recent acquisitions.
 
The Company continues to grow its water distribution and wastewater collection systems to provide reliable service to its expanding franchised service territory and the increasing population within that territory.  During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company installed an additional 97,800 feet of water distribution mains and acquired an additional 235,200 feet of water distribution mains resulting in 1,065 miles of water mains as of December 31, 2022.  During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired an additional 114,100 feet of wastewater collection mains resulting in 94 miles of wastewater mains as of December 31, 2022.

 The Company’s growth in revenues is primarily a result of customer growth and increases in water and wastewater rates.  During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $60,061, an increase of $4,942, or 9.0%, as compared to $55,119 during the year ended December 31, 2021.  In 2022, operating revenue was derived from the following sources and in the following percentages: residential, 65%; commercial and industrial, 27%; and other, 8%, which is primarily from the provision for fire service but includes other water and wastewater service-related income.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Rate Matters” for a discussion of the Company’s rate case management.
