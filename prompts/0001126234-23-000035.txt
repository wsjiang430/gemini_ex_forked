Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Lumos Pharma, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. References in this Annual Report to “us,” “we,” “our,” the “Company,” or “Lumos” are to Lumos Pharma, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. With our principal executive offices located in Austin, Texas and additional executive and administrative offices located in Ames, Iowa, we are engaged in advancing our clinical program and focused on identifying, acquiring, developing, and commercializing novel products and new therapies for people with rare diseases on a global level, for which there is currently a significant unmet need for safe and effective therapies. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) and trades under the ticker symbol “LUMO.”
We have focused our efforts on the development of our sole product candidate, growth hormone secretagogue ibutamoren (“LUM-201”), a potential oral therapy for idiopathic pediatric growth hormone deficiency (“PGHD”) and other rare endocrine disorders.
PGHD is a rare endocrine disorder occurring in approximately one in 3,500 persons aged birth to 17 years. Causes of PGHD can be congenital (children are born with the condition), acquired (brain tumor, head injuries or other causes), iatrogenic (induced by medical treatment) or idiopathic (of unknown cause). Children with untreated PGHD will have significant growth failure, potential adult heights significantly less than five feet, and may have abnormal body composition with decreased bone mineralization, decreased lean body mass, and increased fat mass.
The main therapeutic goal in PGHD is to restore growth, enabling short children to achieve normal height and prevent complications that could involve metabolic abnormalities, cognitive deficits and reduced quality of life. The current standard of care for PGHD is limited to daily subcutaneous injections of rhGH with a treatment cycle lasting up to an average of seven years. Poor compliance with daily rhGH injections during treatment can result in an adverse impact on growth. In August 2021, the FDA approved a new treatment, Skytrofa, a once-weekly injection that would reduce the number of injections over the course of treatment for a patient; however, based on our market research, we believe that many providers and patients will have a preference for an orally administered treatment, when available. 
On March 18, 2020, we closed the business combination (the “Merger”) among the Company, formerly known as NewLink Genetics Corporation (“NewLink”), Cyclone Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly owned subsidiary of NewLink, and Lumos Pharma, Inc., (“Private Lumos”) which has since been renamed “Lumos Pharma Sub, Inc.” whereby Merger Sub merged with and into Private Lumos, with Private Lumos surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, the shares of NewLink common stock were adjusted with a reverse split ratio of 1‑for‑9. Under the terms of the Merger, Private Lumos stockholders received an aggregate of 4,146,398 shares of NewLink common stock (after giving effect to the reverse split). Immediately following the reverse stock split and the completion of the Merger, there were 8,292,803 shares of our common stock outstanding, of which approximately 50% was held by each of Private Lumos and NewLink security holders. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse asset acquisition. 
Strategy
Our strategy is to identify, acquire, develop, and commercialize novel products for the treatment of rare diseases on a global scale, prioritizing direct commercialization in selected markets, beginning with the United States and seeking to enter into partnerships or licensing arrangements in other markets. The critical components of our business strategy include the following:
•continue focus on rare diseases with limited or no treatment options;
•focus on diseases and therapies with clear pathophysiology and mechanisms of action;
•leverage our experience and relationships to in-license promising product candidates from academic institutions, rare disease patient foundations, and/or partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies;
•focus on creative, adaptive and rapid clinical and regulatory execution; and
•where possible, seek to retain global or broad commercialization rights to product candidates to maximize long-term value.
Driven by a sense of commitment to rare disease patients, their families, and the rare disease community, our goal is to be a leading rare disease drug company.
LUM-201 Growth Hormone Secretagogue
Our pipeline is focused on the development of an orally administered small molecule, LUM-201, which is a growth hormone (“GH”) secretagogue, also called ibutamoren, for rare endocrine disorders where injectable recombinant human growth hormone (“rhGH”) is currently approved. LUM-201 is a tablet formulation that will be administered once daily. 
Lumos acquired LUM-201 from Ammonett Pharma LLC (“Ammonett”) in July 2018. LUM-201 received an Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) in the United States and the European Union for Growth Hormone Deficiency (“GHD”) in 2017. The United States patent “Detecting and Treating Growth Hormone Deficiency” has been issued with an expiration in 2036. Related patents have been issued in the European Union (where validations are ongoing), Australia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Ukraine with related patent applications pending in multiple other jurisdictions. If approved, LUM-201 has the potential to become the first approved oral GH secretagogue to treat rare endocrine disorders associated with GH deficiencies, starting with PGHD, providing an alternative to the current standard regimen of recombinant growth hormone product injections. A secretagogue is a substance that stimulates the secretion or release of another substance. LUM-201 stimulates the release of GH and is referred to as a GH secretagogue. 
LUM-201 stimulates GH via the GH secretagogue receptor (GHSR1a), also known as the ghrelin receptor, and also suppresses the release of somatostatin, thus providing a differentiated mechanism of action to treat some rare endocrine disorders (involving a deficiency of GH) by increasing the amplitude of endogenous, pulsatile GH secretion. LUM-201’s stimulatory effect is regulated by both circulating levels of GH and its down-stream mediator insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) which at supraphysiological levels feedback or negatively regulate additional release of GH from the pituitary, hence protecting against hyperstimulation of the pituitary. 
The PGHD population consists of patients diagnosed with organic PGHD (a more severe GH deficiency) and idiopathic PGHD (a less severe GH deficiency). LUM-201 has been observed to stimulate endogenous GH secretion in patients who have a functional but reduced hypothalamic pituitary GH axis, also known as moderate or idiopathic PGHD patients. We believe that patients with idiopathic PGHD (i.e., those who have a functional but reduced hypothalamic pituitary GH axis) represent approximately 60% of PGHD patients and are expected to respond to LUM-201. 
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we launched a program to study the effects of LUM-201 in PGHD and initiated our Phase 2 clinical trial (“OraGrowtH210 Trial” or the “Phase 2 Trial”) with the opening of the initial sites participating in this study. The OraGrowtH210 Trial is a global multi-site randomized study evaluating orally administered LUM-201 at three dose levels (0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 mg/kg/day) against a standard dose of daily injectable rhGH in approximately 80 subjects diagnosed with idiopathic PGHD.
The primary endpoint of the study is preliminary validation of our predictive enrichment marker (“PEM”) patient selection strategy as evidenced by the percentage of selected patients who grow in response to LUM-201. Each patient enrolled in our Phase 2 clinical trials is given a single dose of LUM-201 at the 0.8 mg/kg/day dose to determine if they meet the cut-off criteria for enrollment, which is a baseline IGF-1 > 30 ng/ml and stimulated GH ≥5 ng/ml. The primary efficacy endpoint is annualized height velocity. Secondary endpoints include selection of a pediatric dose of LUM-201 for future studies including Phase 3 and determination of the degree of repeatability of the PEM selection process in PEM positive patients screened for participation in OraGrowtH210. 
We announced on February 28, 2023 that we have completed enrollment for our OraGrowtH210 Trial with 82 subjects and that we anticipate the complete set of six-month, primary outcome data on all 82 subjects in the fourth quarter of 2023.
A second concurrent trial of LUM-201 in PGHD exploring the effects of the novel mechanism of action of LUM-201 in amplifying the pulsatile secretion of growth hormone (the “OraGrowtH212 Trial”) was initiated in the second quarter of 2021. The OraGrowtH212 Trial in PGHD is being run in parallel with the OraGrowtH210 Trial. The OraGrowtH212 Trial is a single site, open-label trial evaluating the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (“PK/PD”) effects of LUM-201 in up to 24 PGHD subjects at two different dose levels, 1.6 and 3.2 mg/kg/day. The objective of the OraGrowtH212 Trial is to confirm prior clinical data illustrating the increased pulsatile release of endogenous growth hormone unique to LUM-201 and its potential for this mechanism of action to contribute to efficacy in PGHD. Our OraGrowtH212 Trial is being conducted at a single specialized pediatric center with the capacity to conduct the more frequent sample acquisition and monitoring required for this type of clinical trial. Data from the OraGrowtH212 Trial may be supportive in future regulatory filings; however, this trial is not required for regulatory approval of LUM-201. The primary endpoint for this trial is six months of PK/PD and height velocity 
data in up to 24 subjects. As we announced on February 28, 2023, we have completed enrollment for this trial with 22 subjects and the primary data readout for all 22 subjects is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
In response to the FDA's request in a letter dated July 16, 2021, we announced in July 2021 that the FDA had restricted treatment with LUM-201 to no more than 12 months. At that time, we extended the treatment period from six months to 12 months for both our OraGrowtH210 and OraGrowtH212 Trials to gather additional efficacy data for LUM-201 in PGHD prior to starting our originally planned long-term extension trial (the “OraGrowtH211 trial”). As announced on May 10, 2022, after review of preliminary safety and efficacy data from both the OraGrowtH210 and OraGrowtH212 Trials, the FDA removed the partial hold and now permits treatment with LUM-201 beyond 12 months. As a result, the OraGrowtH210 Trial has been extended to 24 months to allow subjects to continue LUM-201 therapy uninterrupted. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2022, the protocol for the OraGrowtH212 Trial was amended to allow treatment until subjects reach a bone age of 14 for females and 16 for males, reflecting near-adult height. 
The extension of the treatment period will not impact the primary outcome data read out for the OraGrowtH210 or OraGrowtH212 trials, which will be based on the annualized data from the first six months of treatment. We continue to review the timing of the start of the long-term extension study in context of the OraGrowtH210 Trial extension and will initiate the extension study when appropriate. We do not anticipate these protocol changes, on a stand-alone basis, will extend the time to the initiation of our Phase 3 clinical trial.
During the first quarter of 2022, we initiated our OraGrowtH213 Trial (the “OraGrowtH213 Trial,” and together with the OraGrowtH210 Trial, the OraGrowtH211 Trial, and the OraGrowtH212 Trial, the “OraGrowtH Trials”), an open-label, multi-center, Phase 2 study evaluating the growth effects and safety of LUM-201 following 12 months of daily rhGH in up to 20 idiopathic PGHD subjects who have completed the OraGrowtH210 Trial. Subjects will be administered LUM-201 at a dose level of 3.2 mg/kg/day for up to 12 months. 
The graphic below depicts the clinical development plan for LUM-201. 
Potential expansion of LUM-201 into additional indications 
In May 2022, we announced a clinical collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital (“MGH”) to evaluate oral LUM-201 in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”) in an investigator-initiated trial. This trial will evaluate a dose of 25 mg/day of LUM-201 in 10 men and women with NAFLD. Enrollment in the trial has begun and the first subject has been dosed. GH is a critical stimulator of lipolysis, and preclinical data suggest that amplifying GH secretion has the potential to reduce hepatic steatosis and prevent NAFLD progression. Enhancing the natural pulsatile release of GH has been shown clinically in short-term studies to be more efficacious in inducing lipolysis than continuous infusions of GH. The primary endpoints will be to determine the changes in intrahepatic lipid content, hepatic inflammation and fibrosis with GH augmentation as measured by H-MRS and Perspectum’s LiverMultiScan®. Biopsies will be conducted on a subset of subjects to obtain additional information at the genetic and cellular level in this indication.
We approved an unsolicited grant application for this study and will supply LUM-201 for this pilot trial. Lumos has a pending application for a method-of-use patent for LUM-201 in NAFLD and retains intellectual property rights for LUM-201 in this indication. 
We continue to explore our development path to expand into additional indications for LUM-201. We are actively reviewing the mechanism of action of LUM-201 in a subset of affected patients in other potential indications. Based on our initial review to date, we have narrowed our focus for the next indications to include Idiopathic Short Stature, with a focus on the Asia markets, and Prader Willi Syndrome, where we see an attractive global opportunity. We have prioritized our resources for PGHD and plan to advance planning for Prader Willi Syndrome and Idiopathic Short Stature indications subsequent to the data read-out for OraGrowtH210. 
Mechanism of action of LUM-201
Merck originally developed LUM-201 as a GH secretagogue that selectively acts on GHSR1a specifically in the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus to stimulate the ultradian release of GH. LUM-201 has demonstrated stimulatory GH responses following oral administration in mice, rats, dogs, pigs, and humans. The mechanism of action of LUM-201 is illustrated below.
GHSR1a activation via LUM-201 binding induces GH release, as demonstrated in vitro in rat pituicytes (LUM-201 EC50 1.3 nM). In addition, the treatment of pituicytes with LUM-201 augments the effect of exogenous GHRH on GH secretion, as the two compounds synergistically stimulated GH release from rat pituitary cells, demonstrating distinct mechanisms of action.
Rare Disease Focus
Patient-focused drug development for rare diseases is the foundational focal point at Lumos. We are committed to developing potential therapies with the utmost urgency and care by advancing product candidates through approval by engaging, early and often, with patients to better understand their perspective during the continuum of the drug development process. We are dedicated to promoting a strong patient-centric philosophy among our partners and stakeholders and have initiated work on collaborative patient-focused projects such as increasing disease awareness, enabling better diagnostic modalities and access, and providing education and services to support patient and healthcare communities.
Market Demand
In the United States, approximately one in 3,500 children are born with PGHD. Children with PGHD are characterized by short stature, metabolic abnormalities, cognitive deficiencies, and poor quality of life. The current standard of care for PGHD is 
daily subcutaneous injections of rhGH, which dates back to 1985, and with donor-sourced GH since the 1950s. In August 2021, the FDA approved a competitive treatment, Skytrofa, a once-weekly injection that would reduce the number of injections over the course of treatment for a patient; however, our market research indicates that many providers and patients will have a preference for an orally administered daily treatment.
GH-deficient children who are fully in adherence with their daily injectable treatment regimen may achieve a height in adulthood that is comparable to that of their family members and national norms. Despite the demonstrated benefits of rhGH therapy, compliance continues to be a challenge, as patients treated with daily rhGH typically receive thousands of injections over the course of many years. For caregivers of young children and teenagers who likely have had to endure daily injections of rhGH for many years, the problem of needle fatigue - missing injections because of the pain, bruising or other effects of daily treatment - remains an important reason for noncompliance with daily treatment.
There are various approaches adopted by the pharmaceutical industry to develop rhGH products to reduce the patient burden of daily injections and increase patient compliance with the dosing regimen, including longer-acting GH treatments that would require less frequent injections, like Skytrofa. We believe that an oral treatment would help the idiopathic subset of PGHD patients achieve better treatment results through better treatment compliance than is typical for the current standard of care.
LUM-201 is intended to stimulate the release of endogenous GH in PGHD patients who are idiopathic and have a functional but reduced hypothalamic pituitary GH axis. We believe that the proportion that fits such criteria is approximately 60% of all PGHD patients. If approved, LUM-201 has the potential to become the first approved oral GH secretagogue to treat rare endocrine disorders associated with GH deficiencies, starting with PGHD, providing an alternative to the current standard regimen of daily injections.
In addition to PGHD, there are multiple other indications for which treatment with rhGH has been previously approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), including Prader Willi Syndrome and Idiopathic Short Stature. Prader Willi Syndrome occurs in approximately 1 out of every 15,000 persons. The FDA defines pediatric short stature as being 2.25 standard deviations below average stature for the age group, which is equivalent to 1.2% of the corresponding population. Approximately 60% to 80% of this population is estimated to be defined as Idiopathic Short Stature1, or an estimated approximately 390,000 to 520,000 children in the U.S. in 2022. We intend to investigate the safety and efficacy of LUM-201 in some of these other indications, including Prader Willi Syndrome and Idiopathic Short Stature, subject to corporate prioritization and funding resources. 
Commercialization Strategy
We intend to commercialize LUM-201 for PGHD in markets for which marketing exclusivity or patent protection can be obtained, provided we receive regulatory marketing authorization (an “MA”) and anticipated product sales are sufficiently robust to justify the expenses required. The initial markets for LUM-201 are expected to include the United States and the European Union, which both offer marketing exclusivity for approved products in orphan diseases. We have received ODD in both territories, which is one necessary component of receiving such exclusivity if approved. We may also target additional markets including China, Japan and Korea. We intend to seek ODD in additional countries at the appropriate time. Some territories, such as China, do not offer ODD exclusivity. In order to protect against generic product market intrusion in these markets we will seek patent protection through our existing PEM patent and possible future patent applications.
We currently have no sales, manufacturing, production or distribution capabilities. We expect to enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture, produce, market and sell LUM-201 and any other product candidates in one or multiple geographies. If one or more of our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we expect to establish a specialty sales organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to co-promote and/or commercialize our product candidates. We may choose to work with third parties that have direct sales forces and established manufacturing, production and distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and systems or in lieu of our own sales force and systems. 
Patients with rare disorders are typically treated by a small number of specialists. As a result, we expect our commercial structure to be modest in size with an emphasis on supporting programs to expedite patient identification, diagnosis, and assistance to patients and healthcare providers to support market access relating to treatment and reimbursement support.

Competition
The development and commercialization of new therapeutic products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to LUM-201 and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell rhGH therapies to our target patient group. These companies typically are well established and have extensive experience within our targeted indications. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization, as well as manufacturers and sellers of the LUM-201 compound that may sell the compound illegally or for other indications. Many of these competitors are attempting to develop therapeutics for our target indications.
We are developing our product candidate, LUM-201, for treatment of a subset of PGHD patients based on a once daily weight-based oral dosing regimen. The current standard of care for growth therapies for patients in the United States is a daily subcutaneous injection of rhGH. There are a variety of currently marketed rhGH therapies administered by daily subcutaneous injection and used for the treatment of GHD, principally Norditropin® (Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk”)), Humatrope® (Eli Lilly and Company), Nutropin-AQ® (F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd./Genentech, Inc.), Genotropin® (Pfizer Inc.), Saizen® (Merck Serono S.A.), Tev-tropin® (Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.), Omnitrope® (Sandoz GmbH), Valtropin® (LG Life Science and Biopartners GmbH) and Zomacton® (Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), as well as Skytrofa® (Ascendis Pharma), which is administered by weekly subcutaneous injection. These rhGH drugs, apart from Valtropin and Skytrofa, are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients, caregivers, third-party payors and pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”), as the standard of care for the treatment of GHD. Physicians, patients, third-party payors and PBMs may not accept the addition of LUM-201 to their current treatment regimens for a variety of potential reasons, including the perception that the use of LUM-201 will be of limited additional benefit to patients, or limited long-term safety data compared to currently available rhGH treatments.
In addition to the currently approved and marketed daily rhGH therapies, there are a variety of experimental therapies and devices that are in various stages of clinical development by companies already participating in the rhGH market as well as potential new entrants, principally Novo Nordisk, OPKO Health, Inc. (in collaboration with Pfizer) and Genexine Inc.
Intellectual Property
We have been assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 9763919, 10898472, 10105352 and 11234969 and European Patent No. 3352752, “Detecting and Treating Growth Hormone Deficiency.” The patents are not due to expire in the United States or Europe before 2036 and have also been issued in Australia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Ukraine, with related patent applications pending in multiple other jurisdictions. More specifically, related patent applications have been filed by Ammonett (such patent applications now owned by Lumos) in Brazil, Canada, China, the European Patent Office, New Zealand, and Singapore. The composition of matter patent for LUM-201 has expired and the chemical structure for LUM-201 is in the public domain. However, we have been granted a U.S. method of use patent (and similar applications pending in other regions) directed at growth hormone deficiency disorders.
The claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 9763919, 10105352 and 11234969 are directed to the use of LUM-201 (previously MK-0677) in a method of treating GH deficiency in children. The patents require patients meet certain PEMs related to a partially functioning hypothalamic-pituitary GH axis.
We also have exclusive rights to a patent application PCT/US19/017964 titled “Compositions for the Treatment of NAFLD and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis.” The United States application was converted to a non-provisional application in February of 2019. We may elect to seek collaborations to develop LUM-201 for these indications in the future.
In November 2022, we filed a patent application PCT/US22/050700 titled “Compactable Oral Formulations of Ibutamoren.” The application is currently pending and contains claims directed to certain improved formulations we intend to utilize in our Phase 3 trial and ultimately commercialize. If granted, this patent would provide composition of matter protection through November 2042 for the commercialized version of LUM-201.
License and Asset Purchase Agreement 
In July 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “APA”) with Ammonett and acquired substantially all of the assets related to LUM-201, which Ammonett had licensed from Merck Sharpe and Dohme Corp. (“Merck”) in October 2013 (the “Lumos Merck Agreement”).
The Lumos Merck Agreement grants Lumos (as successor in interest to Ammonett) worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable (subject to Merck’s consent in the United States, major European countries and Japan, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) rights under specified patents and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize LUM-201 for any and all indications, excluding Autism Spectrum Disorders as defined in the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 
On August 12, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Lumos Merck Agreement with Merck (the “Lumos Merck Agreement Amendment”). Pursuant to the Lumos Merck Agreement Amendment, we obtained from Merck a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable (subject to Merck’s consent in the United States, specified major European countries and Japan, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) license under the specified patents and know-how that are the subject of our exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize LUM-201 for diagnostic purposes, excluding Autism Spectrum Disorders. 
Under the APA, we paid Ammonett an upfront fee of $3.5 million in 2018. We may also incur development milestone payments totaling up to $17.0 million for achievement of specified milestones on the first indication that we pursue and up to $14.0 million for achievements of specified milestones on the second indication that we pursue, sales milestone payments totaling up to $55.0 million on worldwide product sales, and royalty payments based on worldwide product sales, as discussed below.
Under the Lumos Merck Agreement, we will be required to pay Merck substantial development milestone payments for achievement of specified milestones relating to each of the first and second indications. Total potential development milestone payments are required of up to $14.0 million for the first indication that we pursue and up to $8.5 million for the second indication that we pursue. Tiered sales milestone payments totaling up to $80.0 million are required on worldwide net product sales up to $1.0 billion, and substantial royalty payments based on product sales are required if product sales are achieved. 
If product sales are ever achieved, we are required to make royalty payments under both the APA and the Lumos Merck Agreement collectively of 10% to 12% of total annual product net sales, subject to standard reductions for generic erosion. The royalty obligations under the Lumos Merck Agreement are on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis and will last until the later of expiration of the last licensed patent covering the product in such country and expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country. The royalty obligations under the APA are on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis for the duration of the royalty obligations under the Merck License and thereafter until the expiration of the last patent assigned to us under the APA covering such product in such country.
The Lumos Merck Agreement shall continue in force until the expiration of royalty obligations on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, or unless terminated by us at will by submitting 180 days’ advance written notice to Merck or by either party for the other party’s uncured material breach or specified bankruptcy events. Upon expiry of the royalty obligations the Lumos Merck Agreement converts to a fully paid-up, perpetual non-exclusive license.
If the Lumos Merck Agreement is terminated, and upon Merck’s written request, we are obligated to use reasonable and diligent efforts to assign to Merck any sublicenses previously granted by us.
Manufacturing
We currently do not own nor do we plan to own, facilities for clinical or commercial manufacturing of our sole product candidate, LUM-201. We have an existing supply of the LUM-201 active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) obtained in connection with the Lumos Merck Agreement that we believe will be sufficient for our current clinical trials of LUM-201, including the OraGrowtH210 Trial. We are in the process of performing a technology evaluation and optimization with a third-party to manufacture additional API to further support our clinical trials. We have an existing arrangement with a contract manufacturer to produce clinical drug product supply for the OraGrowtH210 Trial. 
Ebola Vaccine
In November 2014, NewLink entered into the NewLink Merck Agreement with Merck to develop and potentially commercialize its Ebola vaccine rVSV∆G-ZEBOV that it licensed from PHAC. rVSV∆G-ZEBOV was also eligible to receive a PRV if approval was granted by the FDA, with the Company entitled to 60% of the PRV value obtained through sale, transfer or other disposition of the PRV. On December 20, 2019, Merck announced that the FDA approved its application for ERVEBO® (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live) for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire Ebola virus in individuals 18 years of age and older. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, Merck agreed, among other things, to pay us for the PRV in two installments. As required by the agreement, Merck paid us $34.0 million at the closing during the three months ended September 30, 2020 and $26.0 million on January 11, 2021.
We have received and have the potential to continue to earn royalties on sales of the vaccine in certain countries. However, we believe that the market for the vaccine will be limited primarily to areas in the developing world that are excluded from royalty payment or where the vaccine is donated or sold at low or no margin and, therefore, we do not expect to receive material royalty payments from Merck in the foreseeable future.
Oncology Candidates
We have two small-molecule product candidates, which we acquired from NewLink in the merger. These product candidates, indoximod, NLG802 (a prodrug of indoximod) and NLG919 (a direct IDO1 enzymatic inhibitor) are indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase pathway inhibitors. 
Two U.S. patents covering both the salt and prodrug formulations of indoximod were issued in the United States on August 15, 2017 and February 19, 2019, respectively, providing exclusivity until at least 2036. We are continuing to pursue international patent coverage for these formulations in some countries. We may explore the potential for further development and licensing opportunities for these product candidates; however, we currently do not have any active program for these acquired small molecule product candidates.
Government Regulations
United States-FDA process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drugs. FDA permission to proceed under an investigational new drug (“IND”) application must be obtained before clinical testing of drugs is initiated, and each clinical trial protocol for drug candidates is reviewed by the FDA prior to initiation in the United States. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of drugs in the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, provincial, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
Approval process
The FDA must approve any new drug or a drug with certain changes to a previously approved drug before a manufacturer can market it in the United States. If a company does not comply with applicable United States requirements it may be subject to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, warning or untitled letters, clinical holds, drug recalls, drug seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. The steps we must complete before we can market a drug include:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies performed in accordance with the applicable good laboratory practice (“GLP”) and other regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials start; the sponsor must update the IND annually;
•approval of the trial by an institutional review boards (“IRBs”), or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial begins;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) and current good clinical practices (“GCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication to the FDA’s satisfaction;
•submission to the FDA of a new drug application (an “NDA”);
•potential review of the drug application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to assess compliance with cGMP or other regulations, including licensing requirements and regulations promulgated by state regulatory authorities; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA.
It generally takes companies many years to satisfy the FDA approval requirements, but this varies substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the drug or disease. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a drug’s chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the drug. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The company submits the results of the preclinical testing to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about the product drug’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after submitting the initial IND.
The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND before the company can begin clinical testing in humans. The FDA may, within the 30-day time period, raise concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and place the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the company and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the company begins the clinical trial. Accordingly, the submission of an IND may or may not be sufficient for the FDA to permit the sponsor to start a clinical trial. The company must also make a separate submission to an existing IND for each successive clinical trial conducted during drug development.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for ensuring the quality of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its labeled shelf life.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
As product candidates are developed through pre-clinical to late-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize products, processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives. Any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials. This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidates and/or jeopardize our ability or our collaborators’ ability to commence product sales and generate revenue.
Clinical trials
Clinical trials involve administering the IND to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The company must conduct clinical trials:
•in compliance with federal regulations;
•in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors, and requirements of the IRB; as well as
•under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the safety monitoring parameters, and the effectiveness criteria.
The company must submit each protocol involving testing on United States patients and subsequent protocol amendments to the FDA as part of the IND application. The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the sponsor is not conducting the clinical trial in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The sponsor must also submit the trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials to an IRB for approval. An IRB may halt the clinical trial, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Companies generally divide the clinical investigation of a drug into three or four phases. While companies usually conduct these phases sequentially, they are sometimes overlapped or combined.
•Phase 1. The company evaluates the drug in healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These trials typically evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the IND in humans, the adverse events associated with increasing doses, and if possible, gain early evidence on effectiveness.
•Phase 2. The company administers the drug to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse events and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
•Phase 3. The company administers the drug to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
•Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a drug on the company’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the drug. We typically refer to such post-approval trials as Phase 4 clinical trials.
A pivotal trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements to evaluate a drug’s efficacy and safety to justify the approval of the drug. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but the FDA may accept results from Phase 2 trials if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations in which there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust.
The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, may oversee some clinical trials. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and the competitive climate.
As a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency, we may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures and/or benefit risk analysis designed to help protect subjects from the COVID-19 virus. For example, in March 2020, the FDA issued a guidance, which the FDA subsequently updated, on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, which describes a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including the requirement to include in the clinical trial report contingency measures implemented to manage the clinical trial, and any disruption of the clinical trial as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other factors. In June 2020, FDA also issued a guidance on good manufacturing practice considerations for responding to COVID-19 infection in employees in drug products manufacturing, including recommendations for manufacturing controls to prevent contamination of drugs. The FDA has also published other COVID-19-related industry guidance, including updates to previous guidance, regarding remote interactive evaluations of drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring facilities, and drug product manufacturing and supply chain inspections, among others. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, including new regulatory requirements and changes to existing regulations. Recently, President Biden announced that the administration intends to end the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, 2023. The full impact of the termination of the public health emergencies on FDA and other regulatory policies and operations are unclear.
Submission of an NDA
After completing the required clinical testing, we can prepare and submit an NDA to the FDA, who must approve the NDA before we can start marketing the drug in the United States. An NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the drug’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials on a drug, or from a number of alternative sources, including trials initiated by investigators. To support an NDA, the data we submit must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug to the FDA’s satisfaction.
The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program user fees. The FDA typically increases these fees annually. ODD entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether it will accept the application for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the FDA accepts the filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to standard review NDAs within ten months after the 60-day filing review period, but this timeframe is often extended. The FDA reviews most applications for standard review drugs within ten to 12 months and most applications for priority review drugs within six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee. This is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts that will review, evaluate, and recommend whether the FDA should approve the application. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP, and will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the drug unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
The FDA’s decision on an NDA
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter indicates that the FDA has completed its review of the application, and the agency has determined that it will not approve the application in its present form. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional clinical data and/or other significant, expensive, and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies and/or manufacturing. The FDA has committed to reviewing resubmissions of the NDA addressing such deficiencies in two or six months, depending on the type of information included. Even if we submit such data the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Also, the government may establish additional requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our drugs under development.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”), to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, the FDA may condition approval on substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, the FDA may withdraw drug approvals if the company fails to comply with regulatory standards or identifies problems following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before we can implement the change. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing new NDAs. As with new NDAs, the FDA often significantly extends the review process with requests for additional information or clarification.
Post-approval requirements
The FDA regulates drugs that are manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals and has specific requirements pertaining to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, drug sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. After approval, the FDA must provide review and approval for most changes to the approved drug, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed drugs and the establishments who manufacture its drugs, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a drug on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. There are strict regulations regarding changes to the manufacturing process, and, depending on the 
significance of the change, it may require prior FDA approval before we can implement it. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if a company does not comply with regulatory requirements and maintain standards or if problems occur after the drug reaches the market. If a company or the FDA discovers previously unknown problems with a drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, issues with manufacturing processes, or the company’s failure to comply with regulatory requirements, the FDA may revise the approved labeling to add new safety information; impose post-marketing trials or other clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or impose distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences may include:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the drug, complete withdrawal of the drug from the market or drug recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•the FDA refusing to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspending or revoking of drug license approvals;
•drug seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of drugs; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drugs that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. We could be subject to significant liability if we violated these laws and regulations.
Orphan drug designation
The FDA may grant ODD to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
ODD entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a drug receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the drug may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity.
In Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), the court disagreed with the FDA’s longstanding position that the orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication within an eligible disease. In particular, the circuit court held that the orphan-drug exclusivity for Catalyst’s drug blocked FDA’s approval of another drug for all uses or indications within the same orphan-designated disease, or Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), even though Catalyst’s drug was approved at that time only for use in the treatment of LEMS in adults. Accordingly, the court ordered the FDA to set aside the approval of a drug indicated for LEMS in children. This decision created uncertainty in the application of the orphan drug exclusivity. On January 24, 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies with the court’s order in Catalyst, FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to matters outside of the scope of the Catalyst order – that is, the agency will continue tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a drug for new uses or indications within the same orphan designated disease or condition that have not yet been approved. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity.
Pediatric information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (the “PREA”), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing 
and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which the FDA has granted an orphan designation.
Healthcare reform
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect its future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reform the way in which healthcare is funded and reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of PPACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
•an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
•a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 70% starting January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
•extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program;
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
•expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statue, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
•requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for applicable drug manufacturers to report annually information related to payments and other transfers of value made in the previous year to covered recipients, including physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, among others), and teaching hospitals as well as information regarding ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
•Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on covered entities, which are health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain health care providers, as those terms are defined by HIPAA, and their respective business associates, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
•new requirement to annually report certain drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to licensed practitioners, or to pharmacies of hospitals or other healthcare entities; and
•analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance regulations promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, or drug pricing; state and local 
laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives; state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
The PPACA continues to significantly impact the United States’ pharmaceutical industry. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the PPACA, dismissing the case on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the PPACA. Thus, the PPACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is possible that the PPACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how future challenges and healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact the PPACA, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the PPACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. The PPACA contained provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, or HHS Secretary, as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extending the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations. The PPACA also established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (increased pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. 
In addition, other health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since PPACA was enacted. For example, as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, providers are subject to Medicare payment reductions of two percent per fiscal year through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments from providers from three to five years.
There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. The impact of these legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved.
At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, a number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to 
greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of our products. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
European Union-European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) process
In the European Union, our product candidates may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if an MA has been issued, from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, guidelines on GCP. Although the European Union Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the European Union clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the European Union Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the Member State regimes. To improve the current system, Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (“Clinical Trials Regulation”) on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, which repealed Directive 2001/20/EC, was adopted on April 16, 2014 and published in the European Official Journal on May 27, 2014. The Clinical Trials Regulation entered into application on January 31, 2022 and is intended to simplify the current rules for clinical trial authorization and standards of performance. For instance, there will be a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, a European Union portal and database. The new clinical trial portal and database will be maintained by the EMA in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Union Member States. The objectives of the new Regulation include consistent rules for conducting trials throughout the European Union, consistent data standards and adverse events listing, and consistent information on the authorization status. Additionally, information on the conduct and results of each clinical trial carried out in the European Union will be made publicly available. 
Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the European Union Member States where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (the “NCA”), and one or more Ethics Committees (“ECs”). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
Approval process
Under the centralized procedure, after the EMA issues an opinion, the European Commission issues a single MA valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and officially designated orphan drugs. For drugs that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized MA to the EMA, as long as the drug concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
There are also three other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in the European Union, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
•National procedure. National MAs, issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, are available however these only cover their respective territory;
•Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any European Union country; and
•Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Thereafter, further MA can be sought 
from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national MA.
We do not foresee that any of our current product candidates will be suitable for a national MA as they fall within the mandatory criteria for the Centralized Procedure. Therefore, our product candidates will be approved through Centralized Procedure.
Starting in January 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) took on additional regulatory responsibilities for medical products marketed in the UK, as pan-EU regulatory procedures before the EMA will no longer apply in the UK. MHRA recently issued new guidance to the industry regarding regulation under the UK system. Proposals set forth in the new MHRA guidance will take effect through legislative changes that are subject to parliamentary approval, which may increase the amount of resources and time needed for obtaining regulatory approval in the UK and delay our clinical development and commercialization. The full impact of Brexit on our business remains unclear. 
Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, all applications for MA for new medicines must include the results of trials as described in a pediatric investigation plan (a “PIP”), agreed between regulatory authorities and the applicant, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). Before the EMA is able to begin its assessment of a centralized procedure MA application, it will validate that the applicant has complied with the agreed pediatric investigation plan. The applicant and the EMA may, where such a step is adequately justified, agree to modify a pediatric investigation plan to assist validation. Modifications are not always possible; it may take longer to agree than the period of validation permits; and may still require the applicant to withdraw its Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”), and to conduct additional non-clinical and clinical trials. Products that are granted an MA on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
Orphan drug designation
In the European Union, Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, as amended, states that a drug will be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish:
•that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment; and
•that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, that the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Regulation (EC) No 847/2000 sets out further provisions for implementation of the criteria for designation of a drug as an orphan drug. An application for the designation of a drug as an orphan drug may be submitted at any stage of development of the drug but must be submitted before filing of an MA application.
If a centralized procedure MA in respect of an orphan drug is granted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, regulatory authorities will not, for a period of usually 10 years, accept another application for an MA, or grant an MA or accept an application to extend an existing MA, for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar drug. This period may however be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established, in respect of the drug concerned, that the criteria for ODD are no longer met, in other words, when it is shown on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The exclusivity period may increase to 12 years if, among other things, the MAA includes the results of trials from an agreed pediatric investigation plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an MA may be granted for the same therapeutic indication to a similar drug if:
•the holder of the MA for the original orphan drug has given its consent to the second applicant;
•the holder of the MA for the original orphan drug is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the drug; or
•the second applicant can establish in the application that the second drug, although similar to the orphan drug already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior.
Regulation (EC) No 847/2000 lays down definitions of the concepts ‘similar drug’ and ‘clinical superiority.’ Other incentives available to orphan drugs in the European Union include financial incentives such as a reduction of fees or fee waivers and protocol assistance. ODD does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
Good manufacturing practices
Like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing of drugs prior to approving a drug.
If, after receiving clearance from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. Once we or our partners commercialize drugs, we will be required to comply with cGMP, and drug-specific regulations enforced by the European Commission, the EMA and the competent authorities of European Union Member States following drug approval. Also like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to reinspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a drug. If, as a result of these inspections, the regulatory agencies determine that our or our partners’ equipment, facilities, or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of drug approval, they may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations or the withdrawal of our drug from the market.
Post-approval controls
The holder of a European MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (“PSURs”).
All new MAAs must include a risk management plan (an “RMP”), describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under European Union directives, the details are governed by regulations in each European Union Member State and can differ from one country to another.
Data and market exclusivity
Similar to the United States, there is a process to authorize generic versions of innovative drugs in the European Union. Generic competitors can, where data exclusivity has expired, submit abridged applications to authorize generic versions of drugs authorized by EMA through a centralized procedure referencing the innovator’s data and demonstrating bioequivalence to the reference drug, among other things. If an MA is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic MA applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. This system is usually referred to as “8+2”. There is also a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product.
Other international markets-drug approval process
In some international markets (such as China or Japan), although data generated in United States or European Union trials may be submitted in support of a MAA, regulators may require additional clinical trials conducted in the host territory, or studying people of the ethnicity of the host territory, prior to the filing or approval of MAs within the country.
Pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drugs for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any drugs for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drugs on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drugs can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of drugs and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any drug that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic trials to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our drug. These trials will be in addition to the trials required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a drug to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the drug after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its drugs at a profit.
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, PPACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drugs, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our drugs.
In the European Community, governments influence the price of drugs through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those drugs to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which drugs may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new drugs. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any drugs for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if government and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, the focus on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if Lumos attains favorable coverage and reimbursement status for one or more drugs for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Other healthcare laws impacting sales, marketing, and other company activities
Numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the CMS, other divisions of the HHS, the U.S. Department of Justice, and similar foreign, state, and local government authorities, regulate and enforce laws and regulations applicable to sales, promotion and other activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers. These laws and regulations may impact, among other things, our clinical research programs, proposed sales and marketing and education activities, and financial and business relationships with future prescribers of our product candidates, once approved. These laws and regulations include U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign anti-kickback, false claims, and data privacy and security laws, which are described below, among other legal requirements that may affect our current and future operations.
The FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for drugs under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. Only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that the FDA has approved may be used in labeling once the drug is approved. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those we tested and the FDA approved. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician’s belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. If we do not comply with applicable FDA requirements we may face adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. Promotion of off-label uses of drugs can also implicate the false claims laws described below.
Anti-kickback laws including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that applies to items and services reimbursable under governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, make it illegal for a person or entity to, among other things, knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item, or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions, limited statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, and the scarcity of guidance in the form of regulations, agency advisory opinions, sub-regulatory guidance and judicial decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, PPACA among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statute to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a crime. In addition, PPACA clarifies that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
False claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to the federal government (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursement for, among other things, drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sales and marketing of our drugs may be subject to scrutiny under these laws, as well as civil monetary penalties laws and the criminal healthcare fraud provisions enacted as part of HIPAA.
HIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and imposes requirements with respect to safeguarding the security and privacy of protected health information on HIPAA covered entities and their business associates who provide services involving HIPAA protected health information to such covered entities.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (including physician assistants and nurse practitioners, among others) and teaching hospitals, as well as other information regarding ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members. 
In addition, we may be subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback, self-referral, and false claims laws which may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and submitting claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to file reports with states regarding drug pricing and/or marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the 
registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities, including the conduct of independent contractors or third parties who act or perform services for or on our behalf, and any sales and marketing activities after a product candidate has been approved for marketing, could be subject to legal challenge and enforcement actions. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and/or administrative penalties and adverse actions, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Violations of these laws may result in criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm and the imposition of corporate integrity agreements or other similar agreements with governmental entities, which may impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as individual imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called “responsible corporate officer” doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing. Given the significant penalties and fines that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions and additional corporate integrity obligations. If the government were to allege or convict us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed.
Similar rigid restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of drugs in the European Union and other countries. Even in those countries where we may not be directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our drugs, if our potential international distribution partners engage in inappropriate activity it can have adverse implications for us.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters are in Austin, Texas, where we lease approximately 5,000 square feet of office space under a lease expiring in November 2023. We also lease approximately 6,000 square feet of additional executive and administrative office space in Ames, Iowa under a lease that expires in March 2026. In January 2023, we renewed our lease in Ames, Iowa. The renewed lease expiration date is March 31, 2026. We believe we have convenient access to additional space on reasonable terms for our future needs.
Employees and Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 32 employees. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
We are committed to attracting and retaining the best possible talent. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants.
