 Overview
 Our focus is on developing Ampion, which is a compound that decreases inflammation by inhibiting specific pro-inflammatory compounds.
 Ampion has advanced through late-stage clinical trials in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, provided guidance that we should complete a trial of Kellgren Lawrence Grade 4, or KL 4, osteoarthritis patients with concurrent controls that would be carried out under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, or otherwise with FDA feedback. An SPA is a process in which sponsors reach agreement with the FDA on the design and size of a proposed clinical trial to assure a study adequately addresses scientific and regulatory requirements to support marketing approval. However, the FDA still reserves the right to make changes at a future time which could include requiring additional trials.  AMPION
 Ampion for Osteoarthritis and Other Inflammatory Conditions
 Ampion is the < 5 kDa ultrafiltrate of 5% Human Serum Albumin, or HSA, an FDA, approved biologic product. Ampion is a non-steroidal, low molecular weight, anti-inflammatory biologic, which has the potential to be used in a wide variety of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, as well as immune-mediated diseases. Ampion and its known components have demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity which supports the mechanism of action. 
 We are currently developing Ampion as an intra-articular injection to treat the signs and symptoms of severe osteoarthritis of the knee, or OAK, which is a growing epidemic in the United States. OAK is a progressive disease characterized by gradual degradation and loss of cartilage due to inflammation of the soft tissue and bony structures of the knee joint. Progression of the most severe form of OAK leaves patients with little to no treatment options other than a total knee arthroplasty. The FDA has stated that severe OAK is an ‘unmet medical need’ with no licensed therapies for this indication.  While we believe that Ampion could treat this ‘unmet medical need’, our ability to market this product is subject to FDA approval.
 Market Opportunity
 Osteoarthritis, or OA, is the most common form of arthritis, affecting over 30 million people in the United States. It is a progressive disorder of the joints involving degradation of the intra-articular cartilage, joint lining, ligaments, and bone. Certain risk factors in conjunction with natural wear and tear lead to the breakdown of cartilage. Osteoarthritis is caused by inflammation of the soft tissue and bony structures of the joint, which worsens over time and leads to progressive thinning of articular cartilage. Other progressive effects include narrowing of the joint space, synovial membrane thickening, osteophyte formation and increased density of the subchondral bone. The global market size for treatments that currently address moderate to moderately severe OA was valued at approximately $3.0 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow with a compound annual growth rate of 9.04% through 2025.  The global demand for osteoarthritis of the knee treatment is expected to be fueled by aging demographics and increased awareness of treatment options. Despite the size and growth of the osteoarthritis of the knee market, only a few treatment options currently exist, especially in the severely diseased patient population. Ampion Development 
 Since our inception, we have conducted multiple clinical trials and have advanced through late-stage clinical trials in the United States, initially under the guidance of the FDA’s Office of Blood Research and Review, or OBRR, and most recently under the guidance of the FDA’s Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, or OTAT.

 Study AP-003-A was a U.S. multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of 329 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive Ampion or saline control via intra-articular injection. The study showed a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to the control, with an average of greater than 40% reduction in pain from baseline at 12 weeks. Patients who received Ampion also showed a significant improvement in function and quality of life (quality of life was assessed using the Patient Global Assessment, or PGA) compared to patients who received the saline control at 12 weeks. Furthermore, the trial included severely diseased patients (defined as KL 4). From this patient population, those patients who received Ampion had a significantly greater reduction in pain than those who received the saline control. Ampion was well tolerated with minimal adverse events reported across the Ampion and saline groups in the study. There were no drug-related serious adverse events.
 The trial design of AP-003-C was initiated while we were under the guidance of OBRR and modified when guidance was transferred to OTAT in 2017. The study evaluated the responder rate of Ampion-treated patients as defined by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (“OARSI”) Standing Committee for Clinical Trials Response Criteria Initiative (OMERACT), which included pain, function, and PGA in support of a label for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of severe OAK at 12 weeks. 
     Both OBRR and OTAT have confirmed that our successful pivotal phase III clinical trial, AP-003-A, was adequate and well-controlled and provided evidence of the effectiveness of Ampion and can contribute to the substantial evidence of effectiveness necessary for the approval of a Biologics License Application, or BLA. However, OTAT does not consider the AP-003-C trial to be an adequate and well-controlled pivotal trial and provided guidance that we should complete an additional trial of KL 4 osteoarthritis patients with concurrent controls that would be carried out under an SPA to obtain FDA concurrence on the trial design. An SPA would provide a written agreement between us and the FDA indicating concurrence by the FDA on the adequacy and acceptability of critical elements of the overall protocol design for a study intended to support a future marketing application. The existence of an SPA agreement does not guarantee that the FDA will accept a new BLA or that the trial results will be adequate to support marketing approval. Those issues are addressed during the review of a submitted application and are determined based on the adequacy of the overall submission. We do not plan to begin our clinical trial until we are awarded an SPA from the FDA. Should the FDA award the SPA, we plan to commence enrollment of patients. Even if this proposed trial is completed, the FDA may require additional clinical trials in the future. We cannot ensure that the data derived from a subsequent trial or trials will be sufficient to support marketing approval for Ampion.  
     Ampion Manufacturing Facility
 In December 2013, we entered into a ten-year lease of a multi-purpose facility containing approximately 19,000 square feet. This facility includes a clean room to manufacture Ampion, research laboratories and our corporate offices.  Ampion manufactured at our facilities is used in our clinical trials.
 We moved into this manufacturing facility in the summer of 2014 and it was placed into service during the first quarter of 2016. Since then, we have implemented a quality system, validated the facility for human-use products and produced Ampion.   
 Optina
 In 2018, we reviewed our product portfolio and made the decision to delay the development of Optina or any other product in an effort to focus available resources on the development for Ampion.     Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments. Significant competitive factors in our industry include product efficacy and safety; quality and breadth of an organization’s technology; skill of an organization’s employees and its ability to recruit and retain key employees; timing and scope of regulatory approvals; government reimbursement rates for, and the average selling price of, products; the availability of raw materials and qualified manufacturing capacity; manufacturing costs; intellectual property and patent rights and their protection; and sales and marketing capabilities.

 If we develop a successful product, we cannot guarantee it will be clinically superior or scientifically preferable to products developed or introduced by our competitors.
 Among our smaller competitors, many of these companies have established co-development and collaboration relationships with larger pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, which may make it more difficult for us to attract strategic partners. Our current and potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms, universities and research institutions. Some of these companies and institutions, either alone or together with their collaborators, have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than do we. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborators, have significantly greater experience than us in discovering, developing, manufacturing, and marketing pharmaceutical products. If one of our competitors realizes a significant advancement in a pharmaceutical drug or biologic that addresses the disease targeted by Ampion, our product could be rendered uncompetitive or obsolete.
 Our competitors may also succeed in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals for their product candidates more rapidly than us, which could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage or deny us marketing exclusivity rights. Market acceptance of Ampion will depend on a number of factors, including: (i) potential advantages over existing or alternative therapies, (ii) the actual or perceived safety of similar classes of products, (iii) the effectiveness of sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities and (iv) the scope of any approval provided by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.
 Although we believe Ampion possesses attractive attributes, we cannot assure that it will achieve regulatory or market acceptance, or that we will be able to compete effectively in the pharmaceutical drug markets. If Ampion fails to gain regulatory approvals and acceptance in its intended markets, we may not generate meaningful revenues or achieve profitability.
 The available treatments for osteoarthritis of the knee include:

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, or AAOS, issued their second edition of clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee in May 2013. The AAOS was unable to recommend for or against the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections as studies designed to indicate efficacy are inconclusive. Further, the AAOS was also unable to recommend for or against the use of acetaminophen, opioids, or pain patches as the efficacy studies in this area are also inconclusive. Most importantly, the AAOS does not recommend (with a strong ‘strength of recommendation’) the use of hyaluronic acid injections as, in the AAOS’ assessment, the clinical evidence does not support their use. This clinical practice guideline emphasizes the ‘unmet medical need’ for osteoarthritis of the knee

given the few accepted and available treatments. We believe Ampion is a novel treatment option that, if approved, would be the first non-steroidal, non-hyaluronic-based intra-articular treatment available for pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee.
 Government Regulation
 FDA Approval Process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, record keeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve a pending New Drug Application, or NDA, or Biologics License Application, or BLA, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical and biologic product development in the United States typically involves: 

· | the performance of satisfactory preclinical laboratory and animal studies under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, regulation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the development and demonstration of manufacturing processes, which conform to the FDA mandated current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, a quality system regulating manufacturing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the submission and acceptance of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtaining the approval of Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, at each site where we plan to conduct a clinical trial to protect the welfare and rights of human subjects in clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the biologic for each indication for which FDA approval is sought; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the submission to the FDA for review and approval of an NDA or a BLA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. Preclinical tests generally include laboratory evaluation of a product candidate, its chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as certain animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy. Results of these preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information (in compliance with GLP and cGMP), analytical data and the clinical trial protocol (detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated), must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials can begin.
 An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30‑day time period, raises concerns or questions about the intended conduct of the trial and imposes what is referred to as a clinical hold. Preclinical studies generally take several years to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND based on those studies will become effective, allowing clinical testing to begin. In addition to the FDA review of an IND, each medical site that desires to participate in a proposed clinical trial must have the protocol reviewed and approved by an independent IRB or Ethics Committee, or EC, for sites located outside of the United States. The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, and the selection and safety of human subjects. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, requirements. The FDA and/or IRB/EC may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial or a specific clinical trial site to be halted at any time, or impose other sanctions for failure to comply with requirements under the appropriate entity jurisdiction.

 Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Ampio is seeking a BLA for Ampion. In Phase I clinical trials, a product candidate is typically introduced either into healthy human subjects or patients with the medical condition for which the new drug is intended to be used. The main purpose of the trial is to assess a product candidate’s safety and the ability of the human body to tolerate the product candidate. Phase I clinical trials generally include less than 50 subjects or patients. During Phase II trials, a product candidate is studied in an exploratory trial or trials in a limited number of patients with the disease or medical condition for which it is intended to be used in order to: (i) further identify any possible adverse side effects and safety risks, (ii) assess the preliminary or potential efficacy of the product candidate for specific target diseases or medical conditions, and (iii) assess dosage tolerance and determine the optimal dose for Phase III trials. Phase III trials are generally undertaken to demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population with the goal of evaluating the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product candidate. Phase III trials will generally be designed to reach a specific goal or endpoint, the achievement of which is intended to demonstrate the product candidate’s clinical efficacy and provide adequate information for labeling of the biologic.
 A drug being studied in clinical trials may be made available to individual patients in certain circumstances. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the later of 60 calendar days after the date of enactment of the Cures Act or the first initiation of a Phase II or Phase III trial of the investigational drug.
 After completion of clinical testing under an IND, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs are subject to an application user fee, currently $2.6 million. However, the FDA will waive the application user fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. Small businesses are defined as businesses with less than 500 employees, therefore Ampio is considered a small business. The manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved BLA are also subject to an annual program fee, currently $310,000. The annual program fee replaced the product and establishment user fees that the FDA charged in prior years. These fees typically increase annually.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard biologic products are reviewed within ten months; most applications for priority biologics are reviewed in six months. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities where the biologic is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of the BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, 

 
  8

 
dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug.  Product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 There are accelerated review processes at the FDA, including Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval, none of which Ampio is seeking.
 Foreign Regulatory Approval
 Outside of the United States, our ability to market Ampion will be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities, whether or not FDA approval has been obtained. The foreign regulatory approval process in most industrialized countries generally encompasses risks similar to those we will encounter in the FDA approval process. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorizations, and the time required to obtain the requisite approvals, may vary widely from country to country and differ from those required for FDA approval.
 Under European Union, or EU, regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
 The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. The mutual recognition process results in separate national marketing authorizations in the reference member state and each concerned member state. We will seek to choose the appropriate route of European regulatory filing in an attempt to accomplish the most rapid regulatory approvals for Ampion when ready for review. However, the chosen regulatory strategy may not secure regulatory approval of the chosen product indications. In addition, these approvals, if obtained, may take longer than anticipated. We can provide no assurance that Ampion will prove to be safe or effective, will receive required regulatory approvals, or will be successfully commercialized.
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the Public Health Services Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, requires that there can be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, and can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times. The biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 A novel biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the 

 
  9

 
lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) eighteen months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) eighteen months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42‑month period.
 Post-Approval Regulation
 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval is typically limited to specific clinical indications. Furthermore, after regulatory approval is obtained, subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on its use or complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Any FDA-approved products manufactured or distributed by us are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse events or experiences. Further, biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose rigorous procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future contract manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, total or partial suspension of production activities, failure of the FDA to grant approval for marketing, and withdrawal, suspension, or revocation of marketing approvals.
 If the FDA approves Ampion, we and the contract manufacturers of clinical supplies and commercial supplies must provide certain updated safety and efficacy information. Product changes, as well as certain changes in the manufacturing process or facilities where the manufacturing occurs or other post-approval changes may necessitate additional FDA review and approval. The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a biologic product must also be in compliance with FDA and Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. In addition, we are prohibited from promoting our products off-label. The FDA and FTC have very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter or untitled letter directing us to correct deviations from regulatory requirements and enforcement actions that can include seizures, fines, injunctions and criminal prosecution.
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 We are also subject to regulation by other regional, national, state and local agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory bodies. Our current and future partners are subject to many of the same requirements.
 In addition, we are subject to other regulations, including regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Toxic Substance Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and regulations under other federal, state and local laws.
 Violations of any of the foregoing requirements could result in penalties being assessed against us.
 Privacy
 Most health care providers, including research institutions from whom we or our partners obtain patient information, are subject to privacy and security rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the amendments to HIPAA under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. Additionally, strict personal privacy laws in other countries affect pharmaceutical companies’ activities in those countries. Such laws include the EU Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, as well as individual EU Member States implementing additional laws. Although our clinical development efforts are not barred by these privacy regulations, we could face substantial criminal penalties if we knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a health care provider that has not satisfied HIPAA’s or the EU’s disclosure standards. Failure by EU clinical trial partners to obey requirements of national laws on private personal data, including laws implementing the EU Data Protection Directive, might result in liability and/or adverse publicity.

 Information Systems
 We believe that our Information Systems, or IS, capabilities are adequate to manage our core business.  In addition, our internal controls related to IS are operating effectively. Intellectual Property Summary
 Ampion
 In 2018, we reviewed our patent portfolio relative to Ampion. We made the decision to focus available resources by limiting the maintenance of patent protection for Ampion based on the relative importance of technologies covered by patents, the geographic jurisdiction of patents and remaining patent term. This allowed us to reduce the overall number of patents while maintaining our strategic coverage. The portfolio primarily consists of seven families filed in the United States and throughout the world. 
     The first family includes U.S. patents and a European patent, validated and being maintained in Germany, Great Britain and France with claims relating to methods of treating inflammatory disease and compositions of matter comprising diketopiperazine derivatives, including aspartyl-alanyl diketopiperazine, or DA-DKP. This family also includes issued patents in China, Hong Kong, and Japan. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family is in 2021.
     The second family includes U.S. patents with claims directed to methods of treating inflammation and T-cell mediated or inflammatory diseases with compositions of matter comprising DA-DKP. This family also includes issued patents in Australia, China, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Africa and a European patent (validated in Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy, and the Netherlands) and pending applications in the United States, Canada, China, and Hong Kong. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family is in 2024.
     The third family includes U.S. patents, a pending U.S. application, and issued patents in Australia, China, Eurasia (Russia), Israel, Japan, New Zealand, and Philippines and pending applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, EPO, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, Singapore, United States, and South Africa. The claims in this family are directed to the use of DA-DKP for the treatment of degenerative joint diseases. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family is in 2032.
     The fourth family includes a U.S. patent, a pending U.S. application and pending applications in Australia, Canada, China, EPO, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand with claims directed to the use of DA-DKP to mobilize, home, expand and differentiate stem cells in the treatment of subjects. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family is in 2034.
     The fifth family includes a U.S. patent, a pending U.S. application and pending applications in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Korea and Russia with claims directed to the use of DA-DKP for the treatment of degenerative joint diseases in a multi-dose treatment regimen. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family is in 2035.
     The sixth family includes a pending U.S. application and pending applications in Europe and Hong Kong with claims directed to the use of DA-DKP in the absence of cyclooxygenase-2, or COX-2 antagonist treatment. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2036.
     The seventh family includes a Patent Cooperation Treaty international application with claims directed to the use of N-acetyl-kynurenine for treatment of T-cell mediated diseases, degenerative joint disease and diseases mediated by platelet activating factor and composition of matter. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be 2037.
     Optina
 In 2018, we reviewed our patent portfolio relative to Optina. We made the decision to delay the development of Optina and allow existing patents and applications to lapse by non-payment of annuities and maintenance fees and non-responses to actions in the future in an effort to focus available resources on patent protection for Ampion.

 Barriers to Entry – General
 We also maintain trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect through confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements. We expect to seek U.S. and foreign patent protection for our therapeutic product. These patents may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information. If we do not adequately protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, our competitive position and business prospects could be materially harmed.
 The patent positions of companies such as ours involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, their enforceability cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our issued and licensed patents, and those that may be issued to us in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under the patents or licenses may not provide us with meaningful protection or competitive advantages. Our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us, which could offset any advantages we might otherwise realize from our intellectual property. Furthermore, even if Ampion receives regulatory approval, the time required for development, testing, and regulatory review could mean that protection afforded to us by our patents may only remain in effect for a short period after commercialization. The expiration of patents or license rights we hold could adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our biologic, thus harming our operating results and financial position.
 We will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that such rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If we must litigate to protect our intellectual property from infringement, we may incur substantial costs and our officers may be forced to devote significant time to litigation-related matters. The laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
 Our pending patent applications, or those we may file or license from third parties in the future, may not result in patents being issued. Until a patent is issued, the claims covered by an application for patent may be narrowed or removed entirely, thus depriving us of adequate protection. As a result, we may face unanticipated competition, or conclude that without patent rights the risk of bringing Ampion to market exceeds the returns we are likely to obtain. We are generally aware of the scientific research being conducted in the areas in which we focus our research and development efforts, but patent applications filed by others are maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months and, in some cases in the United States, until the patent is issued. The publication of discoveries in scientific literature often occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. As a result, it is possible that patent applications for products similar to our biologic candidate may have already been filed by others without our knowledge. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and it is possible that development of Ampion could be challenged by other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. If we become involved in litigation concerning the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others, we may incur significant litigation or licensing expenses, be prevented from further developing or commercializing Ampion, be required to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, or subject us to compensatory or punitive damage awards.

 Product Liability and Insurance
 The development, manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products involve inherent risks of adverse side effects or reactions that can cause bodily injury or even death. Ampion, if we succeed in commercializing, could adversely affect consumers even after obtaining regulatory approval and, if so, we could be required to withdraw our product from the market or be subject to administrative or other proceedings. We obtain clinical trial liability coverage for human clinical trials, and will obtain appropriate product liability insurance coverage for Ampion that we manufacture and sell for human consumption. The amount, nature and pricing of such insurance coverage will likely vary due to a number of factors such as Ampion’s clinical profile, efficacy and safety record, and other characteristics. We may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage to address our exposure to product recall or liability actions, or the cost of that coverage may be such that we will be limited in the types or amount of coverage we can obtain. Any uninsured loss we suffer could materially and adversely affect our business and financial position. Employees
 As of March 1, 2019, we had 22 full-time employees and utilized the services of a number of consultants on a temporary basis.
