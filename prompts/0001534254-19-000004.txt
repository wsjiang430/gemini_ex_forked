Item 1. Business

CĪON Investment Corporation, or the Company, was incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on August 9, 2011. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms refer to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. In addition, the term “portfolio companies” refers to companies in which we have invested, either directly or indirectly through our total return swap, or TRS (described in further detail under “Item 1. Business – Financing Arrangements – Total Return Swap” below).

We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. We elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code.

We are managed by CIM, our affiliate and a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with us, CIM oversees the management of our activities and is responsible for making investment decisions for our portfolio. CIM is a joint venture between CION Investment Group, LLC, or CIG, and AIM. Pursuant to the joint venture between CIG and AIM, CIG’s investment professionals provide investment advisory services, including advice, evaluation and recommendations with respect to our investments, and AIM’s investment professionals perform sourcing services for CIM, which include, among other services, (i) assistance with identifying and providing information about potential investment opportunities for approval by CIM’s investment committee; (ii) providing (a) trade and settlement support; (b) portfolio and cash reconciliation; (c) market pipeline information regarding syndicated deals, in each case, as reasonably requested by CIM; and (d) monthly valuation reports and support for all broker-quoted investments. All of our investment decisions are the sole responsibility of, and are made at the sole discretion of CIM’s investment committee, which consists entirely of CIG senior personnel.
Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation for investors. We seek to meet our investment objective by utilizing the experienced management team of CIM, which includes its access to the relationships and human capital of its affiliates in sourcing, evaluating and structuring transactions, as well as monitoring and servicing our investments. Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in senior secured debt, including first lien loans, second lien loans and unitranche loans, and, to a lesser extent, collateralized securities, structured products and other similar securities, and equity, of private and thinly-traded U.S. middle-market companies. See “Item 1. Business – Investment Types” below for a detailed description of the types of investments that may comprise our portfolio.  We define middle-market companies as companies that generally possess annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of $50 million or less, with experienced management teams, significant free cash flow, strong competitive positions and potential for growth.

In addition, we may from time to time invest up to 30% of our assets opportunistically in other types of investments, including collateralized securities, structured products and other similar securities and the securities of larger public companies and foreign securities, which may be deemed “non-qualifying assets” for the purpose of complying with investment restrictions under the 1940 Act.  This treatment extended to the TRS, as we treated each loan underlying the TRS as a qualifying asset if the obligor on such loan was an eligible portfolio company and as a non-qualifying asset if the obligor was not an eligible portfolio company. See “Item 1. Business - Qualifying Assets” below.
In connection with our debt investments, we may receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase equity interests in the form of common or preferred stock in our target companies, typically in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor. We expect that our investments will generally range between $5 million and $50 million each, although investments may vary as the size of our capital base changes and will ultimately be at the discretion of CIM subject to oversight by our board of directors. We have made and intend to make smaller investments in syndicated loan opportunities, which typically include investments in companies with annual EBITDA of greater than $50 million, subject to liquidity and diversification constraints.

To enhance our opportunity for gain, we employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of CIM. On March 23, 2018, an amendment to Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act was signed into law to permit BDCs to reduce the minimum “asset coverage” ratio from 200% to 150% and, as a result, to potentially increase the ratio of a BDC's debt to equity to a maximum 2-to-1 from a maximum of 1-to-1, so long as certain approval and disclosure requirements are satisfied. We currently have not determined whether to seek to utilize such additional leverage. For purposes of the asset coverage ratio test applicable to us as a BDC, we treated the outstanding notional amount of the TRS, less the total amount of cash collateral posted by Flatiron Funding, LLC, or Flatiron, under the TRS, as a senior security for the life of that instrument.

Portfolio and Investment Activity

As of December 31, 2018, we engaged in the direct purchase of debt securities primarily issued by portfolio companies and lend directly to portfolio companies. The following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio at amortized cost and fair value as of December 31, 2018:

 | December 31, 2018 
 | Investments Cost(1) | | Investments FairValue | | Percentage ofInvestmentPortfolio
Senior secured first lien debt | $ | 1,492,034 | | | $ | 1,462,989 | | | 79.0 | %
Senior secured second lien debt | 341,595 | | | 323,365 | | | 17.4 | %
Collateralized securities and structured products - debt | 15,193 | | | 15,193 | | | 0.8 | %
Collateralized securities and structured products - equity | 16,794 | | | 14,827 | | | 0.8 | %
Equity | 38,610 | | | 36,399 | | | 2.0 | %

Number of portfolio companies | | | | 153 | 
Purchased at a weighted average price of par | 97.35 | % 
Gross annual portfolio yield based upon the purchase price(3) | 9.83 | % 


(1) | Represents amortized cost for debt investments and cost for equity investments. Amortized cost represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums and/or accretion of discounts, as applicable, on our investments.


(2) | Short term investments represent an investment in a fund that invests in highly liquid investments with average original maturity dates of three months or less.


(3) | The gross annual portfolio yield does not represent and may be higher than an actual investment return to shareholders because it excludes our expenses and all sales commissions and dealer manager fees and does not consider the cost of leverage.

Our common stock is not currently listed on an exchange. To provide our shareholders with limited liquidity, we conduct quarterly tender offers pursuant to our share repurchase program. In connection with that program, we intend, but are not required, to continue conducting quarterly repurchase offers. This is the only method of liquidity that we will offer prior to a liquidity event. We limit the number of shares of common stock to be repurchased in any calendar year to the lesser of (i) 15% of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding in the prior calendar year, or 3.75% in each quarter; and (ii) the number of shares of common stock we can repurchase with the proceeds we receive from the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to our fifth amended and restated distribution reinvestment plan. Accordingly, it is unlikely that shareholders will be able to sell their common stock when desired or at a desired price.

Although our common stock is not currently listed on an exchange, we intend to seek to complete a liquidity event within three to five years following the completion of our offering stage or at such earlier time as our board of directors may determine, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors. We closed the public offering of our shares on January 25, 2019. We will view our offering stage as complete as of the termination date of our most recent public equity offering if we have not conducted a public equity offering in any continuous two-year period. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete a liquidity event.

As a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in negotiating or investing in certain investments with entities with which we may be prohibited from doing so under the 1940 Act, such as CIM and its affiliates, unless we obtain an exemptive order from the SEC. Furthermore, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions on investing with AIM and its affiliates in transactions where AIM or its affiliates negotiate terms other than price on our behalf. We are limited in our ability to engage in co-investment transactions with AIM and its affiliates and CIM and its affiliates without exemptive relief from the SEC. Even if we receive exemptive relief, CIM’s investment committee may determine that we should not participate in a co-investment transaction.

Status of Our Continuous Public Offerings

On December 17, 2012, we met our minimum offering requirement of $2,500 in capital raised from persons not affiliated with us, admitted our initial public investors as shareholders and officially commenced operations. Our initial continuous public offering ended on December 31, 2015, and our follow-on continuous public offering commenced on January 25, 2016 and ended on January 25, 2019. Since commencing our initial continuous public offering on July 2, 2012 through March 14, 2019, we sold 114,154,265 shares of common stock for corresponding net proceeds of $1,161,817 at an average price per share of $10.18, including shares purchased by our affiliates.  The net proceeds received include gross proceeds received from reinvested shareholder distributions of $169,392 pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, as amended and restated, for which we issued 18,645,057 shares of common stock, and gross proceeds paid for shares of common stock tendered for repurchase of $162,864 pursuant to our share repurchase program, for which we repurchased 17,982,537 shares of common stock.
Distributions

In January 2013, we began authorizing monthly distributions to our shareholders. On February 1, 2014, we changed from semi-monthly closings to weekly closings for the sale of our shares. As a result, from February 1, 2014 through July 17, 2017, our board of directors authorized and declared on a monthly basis a weekly distribution amount per share of our common stock.  On July 18, 2017, our board of directors authorized and declared on a quarterly basis a weekly distribution amount per share of our common stock. Effective September 28, 2017, our board of directors delegated to management the authority to determine the amount, record dates, payment dates and other terms of distributions to shareholders, which will be ratified by our board of directors, each on a quarterly basis. Subject to our board of directors’ discretion and applicable legal restrictions, our management intends to continue to authorize and declare, and our board of directors intends to continue to ratify, each on a quarterly basis, a weekly distribution amount per share of our common stock. Declared distributions are paid monthly. 

Our board of directors declared or ratified distributions for 52 record dates during each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The following table presents cash distributions per share that were declared during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

About CIM

CIM is a registered investment adviser. CIM is a joint venture between CIG and AIM and part of the CION Investments group of companies, or CION Investments. We believe that CION Investments is a leading manager of alternative investment solutions that focuses on alternative credit strategies for individual investors. CION Investments is headquartered in New York, with an office in Boston.

Mark Gatto and Michael A. Reisner, together with Keith S. Franz, Gregg A. Bresner and Stephen Roman, form the senior management team of CIM. Both Messrs. Gatto and Reisner have significant managerial and investing experience and serve as our co-chairmen and co-chief executive officers.

CIM’s senior management team has extensive experience in lending to private U.S. middle-market companies and has developed an expertise in using all levels of a firm’s capital structure to produce income-generating investments, focusing on risk management and delivering risk-adjusted returns that typically are collateralized by a company’s business-essential equipment or corporate infrastructure.

About CION Investments

With more than 30 years of experience in the alternative asset management industry, CION Investments, through its managed funds, provides direct secured financing to private and public companies worldwide primarily in industries such as marine, manufacturing, transportation, automotive, energy and power, telecommunications, industrial and mining. CION Investments provides distribution services as well through CION Securities, LLC, or CION Securities, one of our affiliates.
Pursuant to an administration agreement, through March 31, 2018, ICON Capital, LLC, or ICON Capital, furnished us with office facilities and equipment, and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services. ICON Capital also oversaw our financial records and prepared our reports to shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. ICON Capital also performed the calculation and publication of our net asset value, and oversaw the preparation and filing of our tax returns, the payment of our expenses and the performance of various third party service providers. Furthermore, ICON Capital provided on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we were required to provide such assistance.
On April 1, 2018, we entered into an administration agreement with CIM for the purpose of replacing ICON Capital with CIM as our administrator pursuant to the terms of the administration agreement. No other material terms of the administration agreement with ICON Capital were amended in connection with the administration agreement with CIM. On November 1, 2018, our board of directors, including a majority of the board of directors who are not interested persons, approved the renewal of the administration agreement with CIM for a period of twelve months commencing December 17, 2018.

About AIM

We believe that AIM possesses skills that will aid us in achieving our investment objective.
5

AIM is a subsidiary of Apollo (NYSE: APO) and is the investment adviser to Apollo Investment Corporation (NASDAQ: AINV), or AINV. AINV is a publicly traded BDC that invests primarily in various forms of debt investments, including secured and unsecured loan investments and/or equity in private U.S. middle-market companies.
Pursuant to the joint venture between CIG and AIM, AIM’s investment professionals perform sourcing services for CIM, which include, among other services, (i) assistance with identifying and providing information about potential investment opportunities for approval by CIM’s investment committee; (ii) providing (a) trade and settlement support; (b) portfolio and cash reconciliation; (c) market pipeline information regarding syndicated deals, in each case, as reasonably requested by CIM; and (d) monthly valuation reports and support for all broker-quoted investments.
Market Opportunity

We believe that the market for lending to private U.S. middle-market companies presents a compelling investment opportunity. CIM’s management team has witnessed significant demand for debt capital among middle-market companies that have the characteristics we target. We believe that this demand, coupled with the fragmented availability of funding within our target market, will enable us to achieve favorable transaction pricing. We believe that the following characteristics and market trends support our belief:

•The middle-market is a large addressable market.  According to GE Capital’s National Center for the Middle Market 4th Quarter 2018 Middle Market Indicator, there are approximately 200,000 U.S. middle-market companies employing approximately 47.9 million people. The U.S. middle-market accounts for approximately one-third of private sector gross domestic product, or GDP, which, measured on a global scale, would be the third largest global economy. GE defines middle-market companies as those with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, which we believe has significant overlap with our definition of middle-market companies that generally possess EBITDA of $50 million or less.
•Greater demand for non-traditional sources of debt financing.  We believe that commercial banks in the U.S., which have traditionally been the primary source of capital to middle-market companies, have experienced consolidation, capital impairments and stricter regulatory scrutiny. Consequently, we believe there is an increasing trend for middle-market companies to seek financing from other sources, such as us.
•Disruptions within the credit markets have reduced middle-market companies’ access to the capital markets for senior debt.  While many middle-market companies were previously able to raise senior debt financing through traditional large financial institutions, we believe this approach to financing will become more difficult as implementation of U.S. and international financial reforms, such as Basel 3, are expected to limit the capacity of large financial institutions to hold loans of middle-market companies on their balance sheets.
•There is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital likely to seek additional senior debt capital to finance strategic transactions.  We expect that middle-market private equity firms will continue to invest the approximately $780 billion raised since 2010 in middle-market companies, as reported in Pitchbook’s 4Q 2018 U.S. PE Middle Market Report, and that these private equity firms will seek to support their investments with senior loans from other sources, such as us.
•Specialized lending and unfunded private equity commitments drive demand for debt capital.  Lending to small- and middle-market companies requires in-depth diligence, credit expertise, structuring experience and active portfolio management. In addition, middle-market companies may require more active monitoring and participation on the lender’s part. As such, we believe that, of the U.S. financial institutions that are not liquidity constrained, few are capable of pursuing a sustained lending strategy successfully. We believe this creates a significant supply/demand imbalance for small and middle-market credit. We also expect that private equity firms will continue to pursue acquisitions and will seek to leverage their equity investments with debt financing, including senior debt, unitranche debt, and mezzanine loans provided by companies such as ours. Historically, according to the S&P LCD Leveraged Lending Review, such leverage has represented approximately 62% of a private equity acquisition. Therefore, adding to the imbalance in the availability of credit is the significant amount of unallocated private equity capital raised since 2010 described above, much of which will require debt financing in the coming years. As depicted in the chart below, almost $677 billion of unfunded private equity commitments were outstanding through the end of 2017.

U.S. PE Capital Overhang ($B) by Year

•Active private equity focus on small- and middle-market firms.  Private equity firms have continued their active roles investing in small- and middle-market companies, and CIM expects this trend to continue. Private equity funds often seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured and mezzanine loans from other sources. Thus, we believe that significant private equity investment in middle-market firms will create substantial investment opportunities for us to fill the role of leverage provider. We believe that the network of relationships between CIM’s senior management team, Apollo’s management team and the private equity community will be a key channel through which we will seek to access significant investment opportunities.
•Middle-market companies compared to larger companies.  We believe that middle-market companies compare favorably to larger companies with respect to our investment objective and strategy. According to the GE Capital 2012 National Middle Market Summit Report, almost 70% of middle-market companies have been in business for more than 20 years and are, on average, less financially leveraged than large companies. During the economic downturn from 2007 to 2010, surviving middle-market companies created more than two million jobs, as compared to nearly four million jobs eliminated by larger companies.
•Attractive market segment.  We believe that the underserved nature of such a large segment of the market can at times create a significant opportunity for investment. In particular, we believe that middle-market companies are more likely to offer attractive economics in terms of transaction pricing (including higher debt yields), upfront and ongoing fees, prepayment penalties and more attractive security features in the form of stricter covenants and quality collateral. In addition, as compared to larger companies, middle-market companies often have simpler capital structures and carry less leverage, thus aiding the structuring and negotiation process and allowing us greater flexibility in structuring favorable transactions.

Characteristics of and Risks Related to Investments in Private Companies

We have invested and continue to invest primarily in the debt of privately held companies. Investments in private companies pose significantly greater risks as compared to investments in public companies. First, private companies have reduced access to the capital markets, resulting in diminished capital resources and ability to withstand financial distress. Second, the investments themselves are often illiquid. As such, we may have difficulty exiting an investment promptly or at a desired price prior to maturity or outside of a normal amortization schedule. In addition, little public information generally exists about private companies. Finally, these companies often do not have third-party debt ratings or audited financial statements. We must therefore rely on the ability of CIM to obtain adequate information through their due diligence efforts to evaluate the creditworthiness of, and risks involved with, investing in these companies. These companies and their financial information will also generally not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and other rules and regulations that govern public companies that are designed to protect investors.
Investment Strategy

When evaluating an investment, we use the resources of CIM to develop an investment thesis and a proprietary view of a potential company’s value. When identifying prospective portfolio companies, we focus primarily on the following attributes, which we believe will help us generate higher total returns with an acceptable level of risk. These attributes are:

•Leading, defensible market positions that present attractive growth opportunities.  We seek to invest in companies that we believe possess advantages in scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing or product quality versus their competitors, minimizing sales risk and protecting profitability.
•Companies with leading market positions and strong free cash flows.  We seek to invest in the debt of companies that have a leading market position or other significant competitive advantages and significant free cash flow. We believe that such companies are able to maintain consistent cash flow to service and repay our loans and maintain growth or market share.
9

•Investing in middle-market, private companies.  We seek to invest in middle-market, private companies that generally possess annual EBITDA of $50 million or less at the time of investment. We do not intend to invest in start-up companies, turnaround situations or companies with speculative business plans.
•Proven management teams with meaningful equity ownership.  We focus on investments in which the target company has an experienced management team with an established track record of success. We typically require the portfolio companies to have in place proper incentives to align management’s goals with ours. Generally, we focus on companies in which the management teams have significant equity interests.
•Private equity sponsorship.  Often we seek to participate in transactions sponsored by what we believe to be high-quality private equity firms. CIM’s management team believes that a private equity sponsor’s willingness to invest significant sums of equity capital into a company provides an additional level of due diligence investigation and is an implicit endorsement of the quality of the investment. Further, by co-investing with quality private equity firms that commit significant sums of equity capital with junior priority to our debt investments, we may benefit from having due diligence on our investments performed by both parties. Further, strong private equity sponsors with significant investments at risk have the ability and a strong incentive to contribute additional capital in difficult economic times should operational or financial issues arise.
•Broad portfolio.  We seek to create a portfolio of companies engaged in a variety of industries and located in a variety of geographic locations, thereby potentially reducing the risk of a downturn in any one industry or geographic location having a disproportionate impact on the value of our portfolio. We are not a “diversified company” as such term is defined under the 1940 Act. Because we are a BDC, we focus on and invest at least 70% of our total assets in U.S. companies, but seek to maintain investments across the various geographic regions of the U.S. To the extent that we invest in foreign companies, we intend to do so in accordance with the limitations under the 1940 Act and only in jurisdictions with established legal frameworks and a history of respecting creditor rights, including countries that are members of the European Union, as well as Canada, Australia and Japan. We cannot assure investors that we will be successful in our efforts to maintain a broad portfolio of investments.
•Viable exit strategy.  We focus our investment activity primarily in companies whose business models and growth prospects offer attractive exit possibilities, including repayment of our investments, with the potential for capital gain on any equity interest we hold through an initial public offering of common stock, a merger, a sale or other recapitalization.

Moreover, we may acquire investments in the secondary loan market, and, in analyzing such investments, we will employ the same analytical process that we use for our primary investments.
Potential Competitive Advantages

We believe that we offer to our investors the following potential competitive advantages over other capital providers to private U.S. middle-market companies:

•Proven ability to invest in middle-market companies.   We believe that CIM has proven its ability to source, structure and manage private investments for us. In addition to its ability to call on its resources, CIM is able to draw upon Apollo’s team of 384 investment professionals that have approximately $280 billion of total assets under management as of December 31, 2018. Apollo has developed an expertise in sourcing and investing in debt issued by middle-market companies. We leverage this expertise, which we believe enables us to make investments that offer the most favorable risk/reward characteristics.
•Global platform with seasoned investment professionals.  CIM’s senior management team believes that the breadth and depth of its experience, together with the wider resources of the Apollo investment team, who source, structure, execute, monitor and realize upon a broad range of private investments on behalf of Apollo, as well as the specific expertise of Apollo in the BDC arena, provides us with a significant competitive advantage in sourcing attractive investment opportunities worldwide.
•Long-term investment horizon.  We believe that our flexibility to make investments with a long-term view provides us with the opportunity to generate favorable returns on invested capital and expands the types of investments that we may consider. The long-term nature of our capital structure helps us avoid disposing of assets at unfavorable prices and we believe makes us a better partner for portfolio companies.
•Transaction sourcing capability.  CIM seeks to identify attractive investment opportunities both through active origination channels and through its long-term relationships with Apollo, numerous corporate and fund management teams, members of the financial community and potential corporate partners. We also have access to the experience of CIM’s officers in sourcing middle-market transactions through such persons’ network of originators and underwriters. In addition, CIM seeks to leverage Apollo’s significant access to transaction flow. We believe that the broad networks of CIM and its affiliates will produce a significant amount of investment opportunities for us.
10

•Disciplined, income-oriented investment philosophy.  CIM employs a defensive investment approach focused on long-term credit performance and principal protection. This investment approach involves a multi-stage selection process for each investment opportunity as well as ongoing monitoring by CIM of each investment made, with particular emphasis on early detection of credit deterioration. This strategy is designed to maximize current yield and minimize the risk of capital loss while maintaining potential for long-term capital appreciation.
•Ability to utilize a wide range of transaction structures.  We believe that each of CIM’s and Apollo’s broad expertise and experience in transaction structuring at all levels of a company’s capital structure affords us numerous tools to manage risk while preserving the opportunity for returns on investments. We attempt to capitalize on this expertise in an effort to produce an investment portfolio that will perform in a broad range of economic conditions. In addition, we believe that the ability to offer several forms of financing makes us an attractive provider of capital to prospective portfolio companies. Such flexible transaction structuring allows a prospective portfolio company to forego the substantial cost of conducting multiple negotiations and undergoing multiple due diligence processes to secure the different types of capital it requires.

Investment Types

There are a number of investment types corresponding to a company’s capital structure. Typically, investors determine the appropriate type of investment based upon their risk and return requirements. Below is a diagram illustrating where these investments lie in a typical target company’s capital structure. First lien debt is situated at the top of the capital structure, and typically has the first claim on the assets and cash flows of the company, followed by second lien debt, mezzanine debt, preferred equity and finally common equity. Due to this priority of cash flows and claims on assets, an investment’s risk increases as it moves further down the capital structure. Investors are usually compensated for this risk associated with junior status in the form of higher returns, either through higher interest payments or potentially higher capital appreciation.

We focus primarily on investments in senior secured debt, including first lien loans, second lien loans and unitranche loans, and, to a lesser extent, collateralized securities, structured products and other similar securities, unsecured debt, including corporate bonds and long-term subordinated loans, referred to as mezzanine loans, and equity. The mix of investments in our portfolio and other aspects regarding the implementation of our strategy may change materially over time.
CIM seeks to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. Depending on market conditions and other factors, we may, as noted above, increase or decrease our exposure to less senior portions of the capital structure, where returns tend to be stronger in a more stable or growing economy, but less secure in weak economic environments. We rely on CIM’s experience to structure investments, potentially using all levels of the capital structure, which we believe will perform in a broad range of economic environments.

Typical Leveraged Capital Structure Diagram

 Senior Secured Debt

 First Lien Loans

First lien secured loans are situated at the top of the capital structure. Because these loans have priority in payment, they carry the least risk among all investments in a company. Generally, our first lien secured loans are expected to have maturities of three to seven years, offer some form of amortization, and have first priority security interests in the assets of the borrower. We expect that our first lien secured loans typically will have variable interest rates ranging between 4.0% and 9.0% over a standard benchmark, such as the prime rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. In some cases, a portion of the total interest may accrue or be paid in kind.
11

Unitranche Loans

Unitranche loans provide all of the debt needed to finance a leveraged buyout or other corporate transaction, both senior and subordinated, but generally in a first lien position, while the borrower generally pays a blended, uniform interest rate rather than different rates for different tranches. Unitranche loans generally require payments of both principal and interest throughout the life of the loan. Unitranche loans generally have contractual maturities of five to six years and interest is generally paid quarterly. Generally, we expect these securities to carry a blended yield that is between first lien secured and subordinated debt interest rates. Unitranche loans provide a number of advantages for borrowers, including the following: simplified documentation, greater certainty of execution and reduced decision-making complexity throughout the life of the loan. In addition, we may receive additional returns from any warrants we may receive in connection with these investments. In some cases, a portion of the total interest may accrue or be paid in kind.
Second Lien Loans

Second lien secured loans are immediately junior to first lien secured loans and have substantially the same maturities, collateral and covenant structures as first lien secured loans. Second lien secured loans, however, are granted a second priority security interest in the assets of the borrower. In return for this junior ranking, second lien secured loans generally offer higher returns compared to first lien secured debt. These higher returns come in the form of higher interest and in some cases the potential for equity participation through warrants, though to a lesser extent than with mezzanine loans. Generally, we expect these loans to carry a fixed rate of 10.0% to 13.0% or a floating current yield of 7.0% to 12.0% over the prime rate or LIBOR. In addition, we may receive additional returns from any warrants we may receive in connection with these investments. In some cases, a portion of the total interest may accrue or be paid in kind.
Unsecured Debt

In addition to first lien loans and second lien loans, we also may invest a portion of our assets in unsecured debt, including corporate bonds and subordinated debt. Unsecured debt investments usually rank junior in priority of payment to first lien loans and second lien loans, but are situated above preferred equity and common stock in the capital structure. In return for their junior status compared to first lien loans and second lien loans, unsecured debt investments typically offer higher returns through both higher interest rates and possible equity ownership in the form of warrants, enabling the lender to participate in the capital appreciation of the borrower. These warrants typically require only a nominal cost to exercise. We intend to generally target unsecured debt with interest-only payments throughout the life of the security, with the principal due at maturity. Typically, unsecured debt investments have maturities of five to ten years. Generally, we expect these securities to carry a fixed rate of 10% to 15%. In addition, we may receive additional returns from any warrants we may receive in connection with these investments. In some cases, a portion of the total interest may accrue or be paid in kind.
Collateralized Securities, Structured Products and Other

We may also invest in collateralized securities, structured products and other similar securities, which may include collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, collateralized bond obligations, or CBOs, collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, structured notes and credit-linked notes. These investments may be structured as trusts or other types of pooled investment vehicles. They may also involve the deposit with or purchase by an entity of the underlying investments and the issuance by that entity of one or more classes of securities backed by, or representing interests in, the underlying investments or referencing an indicator related to such investments. CDOs, CBOs and CLOs are types of asset-backed securities issued by special purpose vehicles created to reapportion the risk and return characteristics of a pool of assets. The underlying pool for a CLO, for example, may include domestic and foreign senior loans, senior unsecured loans and subordinate corporate loans.
Equity and Equity-Related Securities

While we intend to maintain our focus on investments in debt securities, from time to time, when we see the potential for significant gains, or in connection with securing particularly favorable terms in a debt investment, we may make non-control investments in preferred or common equity, typically in conjunction with a private equity sponsor we believe to be of high quality. Alternatively, we may hold equity-related securities consisting primarily of warrants or other equity interests generally obtained in connection with our unsecured debt investments. In the future, we may achieve liquidity through a merger or acquisition of a portfolio company, a public offering of a portfolio company’s stock or by exercising our right, if any, to require a portfolio company to repurchase the equity-related securities we hold. With respect to any preferred or common equity investments, we expect to target an annual investment return of at least 20%.

Non-U.S. Securities

We may invest in non-U.S. securities, which may include securities denominated in U.S. dollars or in non-U.S. currencies, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.
12

Cash and Cash Equivalents
We may maintain a certain level of cash or equivalent instruments to make follow-on investments if necessary in existing portfolio companies or to take advantage of new opportunities.
Comparison of Targeted Debt Investments to Corporate Bonds
Loans to private companies are debt instruments that can be compared to corporate bonds to aid an investor’s understanding. As with corporate bonds, loans to private companies can range in credit quality depending on security-specific factors, including total leverage, amount of leverage senior to the security in question, variability in the issuer’s cash flows, the quality of assets securing debt and the degree to which such assets cover the subject company’s debt obligations. As is the case in the corporate bond market, we will require greater returns for securities that we perceive to carry increased risk. The companies in which we invest may be leveraged, often as a result of leveraged buyouts or other recapitalization transactions, and, in certain cases, will not be rated by national rating agencies. We believe that our targeted debt investments typically will carry ratings from a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization, or NRSRO, and that such ratings generally will be below investment grade (rated lower than “Baa3” by Moody’s or lower than “BBB-” by S&P). To the extent we make unrated investments, we believe that such investments would likely receive similar ratings if they were to be examined by an NRSRO. Compared to below-investment grade corporate bonds that are typically available to the public, our targeted first lien secured and second lien secured loan investments are higher in the capital structure, have priority in receiving payment, are secured by the issuer’s assets, allow the lender to seize collateral if necessary, and generally exhibit higher rates of recovery in the event of default. Corporate bonds, on the other hand, are often unsecured obligations of the issuer.

The market for loans to private companies possesses several key differences compared to the corporate bond market. For instance, due to a possible lack of debt ratings for certain middle market firms, and also due to the reduced availability of information for private companies, investors must conduct extensive due diligence investigations before committing to an investment. This intensive due diligence process gives the investor significant access to management, which is often not possible in the case of corporate bondholders, who rely on underwriters, debt rating agencies and publicly available information for due diligence reviews and monitoring of corporate issuers. While holding these investments, private debt investors often receive monthly or quarterly updates on the portfolio company’s financial performance, along with possible representation on the company’s board of directors, which allows the investor to take remedial action quickly if conditions happen to deteriorate. Due to reduced liquidity, the relative scarcity of capital and extensive due diligence and expertise required on the part of the investor, we believe that private debt securities typically offer higher returns than corporate bonds of equivalent credit quality.
Operating and Regulatory Structure

Our investment activities are managed by CIM and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent. Pursuant to our investment advisory agreement, we pay CIM an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as incentive fees based on our performance.

On July 11, 2017, the members of CIM entered into the third amended and restated limited liability company agreement of CIM, or the Third CIM LLC Agreement, for the purpose of creating a joint venture between AIM and CIG. Under the Third CIM LLC Agreement, AIM became a member of CIM and was issued a newly-created class of membership interests in CIM pursuant to which AIM, among other things, shares in the profits, losses, distributions and expenses of CIM with the other members in accordance with the terms of the Third CIM LLC Agreement, which will ultimately result in CIG and AIM each owning a 50% economic interest in CIM.
On July 10, 2017, our independent directors unanimously approved the termination of the investment sub-advisory agreement with AIM, effective as of July 11, 2017, as part of the new and ongoing relationship among us, CIM and AIM. Although the investment sub-advisory agreement and AIM's engagement as our investment sub-adviser were terminated, AIM's investment professionals will continue to perform certain services for CIM and our company, including, without limitation, identifying investment opportunities for approval by CIM’s investment committee. AIM is not paid a separate fee in exchange for such services, but receives distributions as a member of CIM as described above.
On December 4, 2017, the members of CIM entered into the fourth amended and restated limited liability company agreement of CIM, or the Fourth CIM LLC Agreement. Under the Fourth CIM LLC Agreement, AIM’s investment professionals perform sourcing services for CIM, which include, among other services, (i) assistance with identifying and providing information about potential investment opportunities for approval by CIM’s investment committee; (ii) providing (a) trade and settlement support; (b) portfolio and cash reconciliation; (c) market pipeline information regarding syndicated deals, in each case, as reasonably requested by CIM; and (d) monthly valuation reports and support for all broker-quoted investments.
Pursuant to an administration agreement, CIM provides us with general ledger accounting, fund accounting, investor relations, employee compensation and benefit-related services, and other administrative services. In addition, we have contracted with U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC to provide additional accounting and administrative services.

As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. Also, while we are permitted to finance investments using debt, our ability to use debt is limited in certain significant respects pursuant to the 1940 Act. Within the limits of existing regulation, we will adjust our use of debt, according to market conditions, to the level we believe will allow us to generate maximum risk-adjusted returns. We elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.
13

Sources of Income

The primary means through which our shareholders will receive a return of value is through interest income, dividends and capital gains generated by our investments. In addition to these sources of income, we may receive fees paid by our portfolio companies, including one-time closing fees paid at the time an investment is made and/or monitoring fees paid throughout the term of our investments. Closing fees typically range from 1.0% to 2.0% of the purchase price of an investment, while annual monitoring fees generally range from 0.25% to 1.0% of the purchase price of an investment. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, structuring or diligence fees, amendment fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees.
Risk Management

We seek to limit the downside potential of our investment portfolio by:

• | applying our investment strategy guidelines for portfolio investments;


• | requiring a total return on investments (including both interest and potential appreciation) that adequately compensates us for credit risk;


• | creating and maintaining a broad portfolio of investments, size permitting, with an adequate number of companies, across different industries, with different types of collateral; and


• | negotiating or seeking debt investments with covenants or features that protect us while affording portfolio companies flexibility in managing their businesses consistent with preservation of capital.

Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights. We may also enter into interest rate hedging transactions at the sole discretion of CIM. Such transactions will enable us to selectively modify interest rate exposure as market conditions dictate. Furthermore, our ability to engage in hedging transactions may be adversely affected by recent rules adopted by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC.

Affirmative Covenants

Affirmative covenants require borrowers to take actions that are meant to ensure the solvency of the company, facilitate the lender’s monitoring of the borrower, and ensure payment of interest and loan principal due to lenders. Examples of affirmative covenants include covenants requiring the borrower to maintain adequate insurance, accounting and tax records, and to produce frequent financial reports for the benefit of the lender.
Negative Covenants

Negative covenants impose restrictions on the borrower and are meant to protect lenders from actions that the borrower may take that could harm the credit quality of the lender’s investment. Examples of negative covenants include restrictions on the payment of distributions and restrictions on the issuance of additional debt without the lender’s approval. In addition, certain covenants restrict a borrower’s activities by requiring it to meet certain earnings interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio requirements. These covenants are also referred to as financial or maintenance covenants.
Investment Process

The investment professionals employed by CIM have spent their careers developing the resources necessary to make investments in private companies. Our transaction process is highlighted below.
Our Transaction Process

     Sourcing

CIM utilizes its access to transaction flow and seeks to leverage AIM’s significant access to transaction flow as well to source transactions. With respect to CIM’s origination channel, CIM seeks to leverage CION Investments' significant industry relationships and investment personnel that actively source new investments. We believe that CIM’s broad networks have produced and will continue to produce a significant pipeline of investment opportunities for us.
14

Evaluation

Initial Review.  In its initial review of an investment opportunity to present to us, CIM’s transaction team examines information furnished by the target company and external sources, including rating agencies, if applicable, to determine whether the investment meets our basic investment criteria and other guidelines, within the context of creating and maintaining a broad portfolio of investments, and offers an acceptable probability of attractive returns with identifiable downside risk.

Credit Analysis/Due Diligence.  Before undertaking an investment, the transaction team from CIM conducts a thorough due diligence review of the opportunity to ensure the company fits our investment strategy, which may include:

• | a full operational analysis to identify the key risks and opportunities of the target’s business, including a detailed review of historical and projected financial results;


• | a detailed analysis of industry dynamics, competitive position, regulatory, tax and legal matters;


• | on-site visits, if deemed necessary, as well as telephone calls and meetings with management and other key personnel;


• | background checks to further evaluate management and other key personnel;


• | a review by legal and accounting professionals, environmental or other industry consultants, if necessary;


• | financial sponsor due diligence, including portfolio company and lender reference checks, if necessary; and


• | a review of management’s experience and track record.

When possible, our advisory team seeks to structure transactions in such a way that our target companies are required to bear the costs of due diligence, including those costs related to any outside consulting work we may require.

Execution 

Recommendation.  CIM seeks to maintain a defensive approach toward its investment recommendations by emphasizing risk control in its transaction process, which includes (1) the pre-review of each opportunity by one of its portfolio managers to assess the general quality, value and fit relative to our portfolio, (2) where possible, transaction structuring with a focus on preservation of capital in varying economic environments and (3) ultimate approval of investment recommendations by CIM’s investment committee.

Approval.  After completing its internal transaction process, the CIM transaction team makes formal recommendations for review and approval by CIM's investment committee. In connection with its recommendation, it transmits any relevant underwriting material and other information pertinent to the decision-making process. Each new investment that we make requires the approval of a majority of members of CIM's investment committee.
Monitoring

Portfolio Monitoring.  CIM closely monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis, as well as monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if each is meeting its respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. In addition, depending on the size, nature and performance of the transaction, senior investment professionals of CIM may take board seats or obtain board observation rights for our portfolio companies.

CIM has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which includes, but are not limited to, the assessment of success in adhering to a portfolio company’s business plan and compliance with covenants; periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; comparisons to other portfolio companies in the industry; attendance at and participation in board meetings; and review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.

CIM uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. These ratings are just one of several factors that CIM uses to monitor our portfolio, are not in and of themselves determinative of fair value or revenue recognition and are presented for indicative purposes. CIM rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company’s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors.
15

The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating used in this ratings system:

Investment Rating | Description 
1 | Indicates the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. 
2 | Indicates a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing in accordance with our analysis of its business and the full return of principal and interest or dividend is expected. 
3 | Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased since origination or acquisition, but full return of principal and interest or dividend is expected. A portfolio company with an investment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring. 
4 | Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased significantly since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and noncompliance with debt covenants, and we expect some loss of interest, dividend or capital appreciation, but still expect an overall positive internal rate of return on the investment.
5 | Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. Loss of interest or dividend and some loss of principal investment is expected, which would result in an overall negative internal rate of return on the investment. 


For investments rated 3, 4 or 5, CIM enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.

CIM monitors and, when appropriate, changes investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, CIM reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis.
The following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio based on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, excluding short term investments of $12,537 and $206,547, respectively:

 | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 
Investment Rating | InvestmentsFair Value | | Percentage ofInvestment Portfolio | | InvestmentsFair Value | | Percentage ofInvestment Portfolio
1 | $ | — | | | — | | | $ | — | | | — | 
2 | 1,642,270 | | | 88.6 | % | | 1,274,569 | | | 84.5 | %
3 | 181,118 | | | 9.8 | % | | 202,950 | | | 13.5 | %
4 | 26,412 | | | 1.4 | % | | 21,311 | | | 1.4 | %
5 | 2,973 | | | 0.2 | % | | 8,818 | | | 0.6 | %
 | $ | 1,852,773 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 1,507,648 | | | 100.0 | %

 The amount of the investment portfolio in each rating category may vary substantially from period to period resulting primarily from changes in the composition of each portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the rating of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values.
Valuation Process.  Each quarter, we value investments in our portfolio, and such values are disclosed each quarter in reports filed with the SEC. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are recorded at such market quotations. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors determines the fair value of investments in good faith utilizing the input of our audit committee, CIM, and any other professionals or materials that our board of directors deems worthy and relevant, including independent third-party valuation firms, if applicable.

Managerial Assistance.  As a BDC, we must offer, and provide upon request, managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Depending on the nature of the assistance required, CIM will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. To the extent fees are paid for these services, we, rather than CIM, will retain any fees paid for such assistance.
16

Exit

Exit Transactions.  We seek to invest in companies that can generate consistent cash flow to repay their loans while maintaining growth in their businesses. We expect this internally generated cash flow to be a key means through which we will receive timely payment of interest and loan principal. Additionally, we attempt to invest in portfolio companies whose business models and growth prospects offer attractive exit possibilities via third-party transactions, including sales to strategic or other buyers and initial public offerings of common stock. Such third-party transactions may be particularly important in realizing capital gains through the equity portions of our investments. We also seek to exit investments in secondary market transactions when price targets are achieved or circumstances otherwise warrant.
Financing Arrangements
To seek to enhance our returns, we employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of CIM. On March 23, 2018, an amendment to Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act was signed into law to permit BDCs to reduce the minimum “asset coverage” ratio from 200% to 150% and, as a result, to potentially increase the ratio of a BDC's debt to equity to a maximum 2-to-1 from a maximum of 1-to-1, so long as certain approval and disclosure requirements are satisfied. We currently have not determined whether to seek to utilize such additional leverage.  See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our financing arrangements.
Total Return Swap

On December 17, 2012, Flatiron, our wholly-owned, consolidated financing subsidiary, entered into a TRS with Citibank, N.A., or Citibank. Flatiron and Citibank amended the TRS on several occasions, most recently on February 18, 2017 to extend the termination or call date from February 18, 2017 to April 18, 2017. Prior to the call date, the maximum aggregate market value of the portfolio of loans subject to the TRS (determined at the time each such loan became subject to the TRS) was $800,000 and the interest rate payable by Flatiron to Citibank with respect to each loan included in the TRS was a spread of 1.40% per year over the floating rate index specified for each such loan, which would not be less than zero.   The agreements between Flatiron and Citibank, which collectively established the TRS, are referred to herein as the TRS Agreement.     
A TRS is a contract in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to another party based on the change in the market value of and interest payments from the assets underlying the TRS in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate. A TRS effectively adds leverage to a portfolio by providing investment exposure to a security or market without owning or taking physical custody of such security or investing directly in such market. Because of the unique structure of a TRS, a TRS typically offers lower financing costs than are offered through more traditional borrowing arrangements.
The TRS with Citibank enabled us, through our ownership of Flatiron, to obtain the economic benefit of owning the loans subject to the TRS, without actually owning them, in return for an interest-type payment to Citibank. As such, the TRS was analogous to Flatiron borrowing funds to acquire loans and incurring interest expense to a lender.
On April 18, 2017, the TRS expired in accordance with its terms subsequent to the consummation of the Citibank Credit Facility (as defined and described in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report). 
Determination of Net Asset Value

The value of our assets is determined quarterly and at such other times that an event occurs that materially affects the valuation. The valuation is made pursuant to Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, which requires that we value our assets as follows: (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available, and (ii) for all other securities and assets, at fair value, as determined in good faith by our board of directors. As a BDC, Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act requires the board of directors to determine in good faith the fair value of portfolio securities for which a market price is not readily available, and it does so in conjunction with the application of our valuation procedures by CIM.
17

There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each asset while employing a valuation process that is consistently followed. Determinations of fair value involve subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations in our consolidated financial statements.
Regulation

We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. A BDC is a special category of investment company under the 1940 Act that was added by Congress to facilitate the flow of capital to private companies and small public companies that do not have efficient or cost-effective access to public capital markets or other conventional forms of corporate financing. BDCs make investments in private or thinly-traded public companies in the form of long-term debt and/or equity capital, with the goal of generating current income or capital growth.

BDCs are closed-end funds that elect to be regulated as BDCs under the 1940 Act. As such, BDCs are subject to only certain provisions of the 1940 Act, as well as the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. BDCs are provided greater flexibility under the 1940 Act than are other investment companies in dealing with their portfolio companies, issuing securities, and compensating their managers. BDCs can be internally or externally managed and may qualify to elect to be taxed as RICs for federal tax purposes. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters, and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of a BDC’s directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities.

The 1940 Act defines “a majority of the outstanding voting securities” as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (ii) 50% of our voting securities.

We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our shareholders, and our shareholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing shareholders, in payment of distributions and in certain other limited circumstances.

As a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in negotiating or investing in certain investments. For example, we generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain entities affiliated with CIM in transactions originated by CIM or its affiliates unless we obtain an exemptive order from the SEC. Furthermore, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions on investing with AIM and its affiliates in transactions where AIM or its affiliates negotiate terms other than price on our behalf. We are limited in our ability to engage in co-investment transactions with AIM and its affiliates and CIM and its affiliates without exemptive relief from the SEC.

We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act. We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might indirectly subject our shareholders to additional expenses as they will indirectly be responsible for the costs and expenses of such companies. None of our investment policies are fundamental and any may be changed without shareholder approval.
Qualifying Assets

Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:

1. | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer that:


a. | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the U.S.;


b. | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and


c. | satisfies any of the following:


i. | does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;

18


ii. | has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;


iii. | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or


iv. | is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million.


2. | Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control.


3. | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.


4. | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.


5. | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.


6. | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.

In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the U.S. and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies

In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, we must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where we purchase such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. Depending on the nature of the assistance required, CIM will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. To the extent fees are paid for these services, we, rather than CIM, will retain any fees paid for such assistance.
Temporary Investments

Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we may not meet the RIC diversification tests, as further described in the “Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company” section below, in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. CIM will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.

Senior Securities

We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. Recent legislation has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150%, if certain requirements are met. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Business Development Companies - Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.”
Code of Ethics

We and CIM have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. The code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 8, 2017, which is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. Shareholders may also obtain copies of the code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov.
Compliance Policies and Procedures

We and CIM have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our Chief Compliance Officer, or CCO, is responsible for administering our policies and procedures and CIM’s chief compliance officer is responsible for administering its policies and procedures.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to CIM. The proxy voting policies and procedures of CIM are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by CIM and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
Introduction

As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, CIM has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, it recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. These policies and procedures for voting proxies for the investment advisory clients of CIM are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
Proxy Policies

CIM will vote proxies relating to our securities in a manner that it believes, in its discretion, to be in the best interest of our shareholders. It will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a shareholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by its clients. Although CIM will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on its clients’ portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.

The proxy voting decisions of CIM are made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of its clients’ investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, it will require that: (a) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to the chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote and (b) officers and employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how CIM intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. The CCO of CIM will work with the appropriate senior officers to resolve any conflict that may arise.

Proxy Voting Records

Shareholders may obtain information, without charge, regarding how CIM voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, c/o CĪON Investment Corporation, 3 Park Avenue, 36th Floor, New York, NY 10016.

Election to be Taxed as a Regulated Investment Company

We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our shareholders from our tax earnings and profits. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses and determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid. We refer to this as the Annual Distribution Requirement.
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company

If we:

• | qualify as a RIC; and


• | satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement,

then we will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to shareholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our shareholders.

We will be subject to a 4.0% nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98.0% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.

In order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:

• | continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities, loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, or the 90% Income Test; and


• | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:


• | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and


• | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or the Diversification Tests.

 For federal income tax purposes, we may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with contractual “payment-in-kind,” or PIK, interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or debt instruments that were issued with warrants), we must include in income each taxable year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. We anticipate that a portion of our income may constitute original issue discount or other income required to be included in taxable income prior to receipt of cash.

Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of the accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our shareholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting the annual distribution requirement necessary to qualify for and maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code. We may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forego new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax. Our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 
21

Under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our shareholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. As a result, we may be prohibited from making distributions necessary to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. Even if we are not prohibited from making distributions, our ability to raise additional capital to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement may be limited. If we are not able to make sufficient distributions to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax.
Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (1) treat dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income as non-qualified dividend income, (2) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (3) convert lower-taxed long-term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (4) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (5) cause us to recognize income or gain without receipt of a corresponding distribution of cash, (6) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (7) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (8) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We intend to monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the potential adverse effect of these provisions, but there can be no assurance that any adverse effects of these provisions will be mitigated.

If we purchase shares in a passive foreign investment company, or a PFIC, we may be subject to federal income tax on its allocable share of a portion of any “excess distribution” received on, or any gain from the disposition of, such shares even if our allocable share of such income is distributed as a taxable dividend to our shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest generally will be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from any such excess distribution or gain. If we invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a “qualified electing fund” under the Code, or a QEF, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year our proportionate share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed by the QEF. Alternatively, we may be able to elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income our allocable share of any increase in the value of such shares, and as ordinary loss our allocable share of any decrease in such value to the extent that any such decrease does not exceed prior increases included in our income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of distributions from PFICs and proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% excise tax.

Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance

We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act, including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:

• | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our co-chief executive officers and our chief financial officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;


• | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; and


• | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We intend to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.

As a non-accelerated filer, we are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would require that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This may increase the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected.
Other

We are periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.

We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our shareholders arising from willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
22

Employees

We do not currently have any employees and we do not currently intend to hire any in the future. The compensation of our chief financial officer and treasurer, Keith S. Franz, and our chief compliance officer and secretary, Stephen Roman, is paid by CIM. We reimburse CIM for the compensation paid to our chief financial officer and his staff and our chief compliance officer and his staff.  In the future, CIM may retain additional investment personnel based upon its needs.
Available Information

Within 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter, we distribute our quarterly report on Form 10-Q to all shareholders of record. In addition, we distribute our annual report on Form 10-K to all shareholders within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year. These reports are available on our website at www.cioninvestments.com and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and shareholders should not consider information contained on our website to be part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We file with or submit to the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information meeting the informational requirements of the Exchange Act. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information filed electronically by us with the SEC, which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
