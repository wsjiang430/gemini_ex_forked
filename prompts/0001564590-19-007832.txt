Item 1. Business
Overview
 Cue Biopharma is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to designing and developing a novel and proprietary class of biologic product candidates engineered to selectively modulate the human immune system. Our Immuno-STAT™ (Selective Targeting and Alteration of T Cells) platform enables us to engineer product candidates that we call Immuno-STATs™ or Immuno-STAT biologics™ that directly engage with and direct the activity of antigen specific T cells in a patient’s body through a singular molecular framework. We believe this precise targeting of disease relevant T cells will allow us to harness the fullest potential of an individual’s intrinsic immune repertoire while avoiding broad immune activation (for immuno-oncology or infectious immunity) or broad immune suppression (for autoimmunity and inflammation). In addition to the selective control of T cell activity, we believe Immuno-STATs offer several key points of potential differentiation over competing approaches, including broad disease coverage, manufacturability, and convenient administration.
 Through rational protein engineering, we leverage the modular and versatile nature of the Immuno-STAT platform to design therapeutics for selective immune modulation in cancer, chronic infectious disease, and autoimmune disease. To address the needs of these clinical indications, we have developed three biologic series, CUE-100, CUE-200, and CUE-300, each possessing distinct signaling modules that underscore unique biological mechanisms that may be applied across many diseases.
 
Overview of CUE-100, CUE-200, and CUE-300 Series and Therapeutic Applications 
 

The modularity and flexibility of the Immuno-STAT platform is exemplified by the CUE-100, CUE-200 and CUE-300 series, which selectively incorporate distinct activating signals to enhance antigen-specific T cells. The CUE-100 series includes an affinity-modified IL-2 molecule that allows for selective activation of antigen-specific T cells. The CUE-200 series includes CD80 and 4-1BBL to selectively focus on exhausted or anergized T cells in chronic infectious diseases and potentially in cancer. The CUE-300 series is designed to selectively activate Tregs and/or inhibit pathogenic effector T cells.
 
We have made significant progress with the CUE-100, CUE-200 and CUE-300 series. We plan to file an Investigational New Drug application (IND) for our most advanced program CUE-101 in HPV-associated cancers and initiate clinical trials during the first half of 2019. This program is representative of the CUE-100 series for which we have generated a robust preclinical data package, including activation of human HPV specific T cells from human blood.  We are advancing a pipeline of additional promising preclinical candidates with the potential to treat multiple cancers, autoimmune disorders and chronic infectious diseases.

Our Approach
 
The Immune System and T Cells
 
As highlighted in the figure below, a critical component of human health is achieving and maintaining a state of immune balance.  Imbalance of the immune system underscores many diseased states: susceptibility to cancers and chronic infectious disease can be attributed to inadequate or attenuated immune responses, while autoimmune diseases result from an overactive immune system that reacts against the host.
 
3

Immune Balance 
 

The human immune system comprises a number of specialized cell types that collectively function to identify and defend the body against foreign threats. A human T cell is a subtype of a white blood cell that plays a central role in the immune system. During an immune response, T cells are activated via close encounters with a specialized cell type known as the antigen presenting cell (“APC”). Prominent APC types include dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells. The primary function of an APC is to uptake antigens, primarily proteins, catabolize them into peptides and display them on their cell-surface in complex with specialized molecules known as the major histocompatibility complex molecules (“MHC”, or “HLA” in humans). This critical function of an APC, also referred to as “antigen processing and presentation”, ultimately results in generation of the key molecular substrate – the peptide MHC complex (pMHC or pHLA in humans) – that is recognized by the T cell via its T cell receptor (“TCR”). The source of the antigenic world for the APC is vast and unlimited: antigens from pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and others activate T cells for protective immunity; antigens from tumor cells are key for robust anti-tumor T cell responses; and antigens from self-tissue are aberrantly recognized by autoreactive T cells. Hence, the nature of the pMHC complex on the APC sets the specificity of the T cell response. The intimate interactions between the T cells and APCs occur within a molecular interface known as the immunological or immune synapse (as shown in figure below) wherein the TCR-pMHC engagement as well as additional accessary signals are sensed by T cell resulting in T cell activation or regulation. In essence, the immune synapse allows controlled engagement and selective activation of T cells through the presentation of two distinct signals: Signal 1, TCR engagement of the pMHC; and Signal 2, activating co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory signals.
The Immune Synapse
 

Importantly, TCR is unique to each T cell and, consequently, each T cell is highly specific for a particular pMHC target. The composite T cell repertoire of an individual harbors approximately 10-to-25 million different T cell specificities, which endows the host to mount an immune response against diverse antigens.  Although normally quiescent and in limited numbers, T cells bearing specific TCRs can be readily activated and amplified by APCs to generate highly potent T cell responses. Such activated T cell responses are capable of attacking and clearing viral infections, bacterial infections, and other cellular threats, including tumors. Conversely, broad, non-specific activation of overly active T cell responses against self or shared antigens can give rise to T cells inappropriately attacking and destroying healthy tissues or cells. 
 
As mentioned earlier, robust and effective T cell activation requires that the TCR signal be accompanied by additional signals from the APC, collectively referred to as “co-stimulation.” The sum of these interactions directs the quality and magnitude of 
 4

the T cell response. Specific co-stimulatory signals, as well as co-inhibitory signals, may be delivered by the APC to the T cell through specific signaling molecules (ligands) interacting with their cognate receptors at the interface of these two cells. Communication between APCs and T cells must be capable of precisely identifying threats and generating a response of appropriate quality and magnitude. 
 
While the elegant nature of T cell-APC interactions is an essential component of immunity or tolerance (i.e. not reactive to self), it is often encumbered by many considerations including: (i) antigen availability and release for presentation by APCs; (ii) antigen uptake and processing efficiencies of an APC that generate the appropriate pMHC complex for the T cell; (iii) stability, amount and turnover of pMHC complexes displayed on the cell surface of an APC; (iv) the “right” kind of the APC phenotype for the desired biological outcome – activating versus tolerogenic, for example; (v) effects of the local tissue/tumor microenvironment on the APC (for example, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments directly impede local APC function in the tumor lesion); and (vi) the absolute dependency on localization and encounter of the right T cell with the right APC in the individual. These challenges could be potentially circumvented if the essential components for T cell activation (i.e., pMHC complex and appropriate co-stimulatory signals), are provided to the T cells directly with no dependency on the APCs. This is the core focus of the Immuno-STAT platform, as described below.
 

The Immuno-STAT: “Immune Responses, on Cue”
 
Through rational protein engineering, we are developing a proprietary class of Immuno-STAT product candidates to selectively modulate the activity of antigen-specific T cells in a patient’s body. Our Immuno-STATs direct T cell activity via two distinct signals presented naturally within the immune synapse by the body when mounting an immune response. We accomplish this by the fusion of a TCR targeting pMHC complex (i.e., Signal 1) with co-stimulatory signaling molecules (i.e., Signal 2). This co-engagement of signals through the TCR and co-stimulatory receptor mimics and recapitulates the very signals delivered by APCs to T cells during an immune response. In this way, Immuno-STATs harness “nature’s cues” for antigen specificity, along with appropriate secondary activating or inhibitory signals, resulting in targeted T cell modulation.
 
The Immuno-STAT
 
During the last decade, there has been substantial progress in therapeutically modifying the function of immune cells, such as T cells, to either enhance tumor killing in the context of oncology or protect tissue in the context of autoimmune disease.  Much of the focus has centered on approaches that result in broad and non-specific immune modulation (e.g., cytokines, cytokine inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors, bi-specifics) with significant challenges remaining to be addressed regarding specificity, efficacy and patient safety.  
 More recently, adoptive cell therapies (e.g., CAR-Ts) have shown promise in removing T cells from patients, activating, stimulating, and expanding them outside the body (i.e., ex vivo) and then infusing them back into the patients for therapeutic benefit.  While these approaches have demonstrated impressive clinical responses in several hematologic malignancies, they are also associated with significant toxicity, including life threatening cytokine release syndrome. Moreover, the technical requirements and expense associated with individualized T cell extraction, ex vivo amplification /modification, and patient re-infusion represent significant scaling and cost challenges that might limit broad usage and eventual commercialization of this therapeutic modality
 
We believe that our Immuno-STAT product candidates may offer several points of potential clinical differentiation over competing immunotherapy approaches, including:
 
 
• | “Ready-to-engage” biologic that specifically targets and selectively modulates disease relevant T cells
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5

 
• | Not dependent on barriers of natural antigen presentation via antigen presenting cells (e.g., vaccines)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to control specificity, quantity and quality of the modulating signal rather than systemic, non-selective signaling (e.g., rIL-2, bi-specifics, etc.)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Administered directly to the patient and does not involve ex-vivo manipulation of T cells (e.g., cell therapy)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Therapeutic Applications
 
An insufficient T cell response may result in a persistent pathogenic infection or, in the case of cancer, tumor persistence. Conversely, an excessive T cell response may damage the host chronically through autoimmune disease. In each of the above diseased states, the desired therapeutic approach should specifically target the dysregulated immune axis thereby providing the maximal potential for patient benefit.

• | In the context of cancer and chronic infectious disease, Immuno-STATs are designed to selectively activate disease-specific T cells
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For the treatment of autoimmune disease, Immuno-STATs are designed to selectively inhibit pathogenic autoreactive T cells
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We plan to leverage the modularity and versatility of the platform to design Immuno-STATs that address particular T cell modulation objectives/criteria, including different co-stimulatory/co-inhibitory signals across disease areas (e.g., cancer vs. autoimmune) and different targeting peptides across indications (e.g., head and neck cancer vs breast cancer).
 
Immuno-STAT Modularity
 

Potential Commercialization Advantages
 
In addition to the selective control of T cell activity, we believe our Immuno-STAT platform offers several key points of potential differentiation over competing approaches
 
 
• | Access to a broad set of disease targets (extracellular and intracellular antigens) and patient populations (diverse HLA types).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilizes industry standard development and production process to support a cost-of-goods and supply chain similar to monoclonal antibodies.

Our Pipeline
 The following table summarizes the status of our product development pipeline.
 Pipeline Overview


Immuno-Oncology
 CUE-100 Framework
 ​Product candidates developed within our CUE-100 framework selectively stimulate the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor, a potent activator of the pathway critical to the growth, expansion and survival of T cells. We have engineered the framework to activate specific T cell populations through peptide-MHC complex (pMHC) targeting of T cell receptors (TCRs) and selective deployment of the IL-2 signal. The IL-2 has been attenuated to enable our Immuno-STATs to preferentially activate tumor specific T-cells without systemically activating other T cell populations, thereby potentially mitigating the dose-limiting toxicities associated with current IL-2-based therapies. 
 CUE-101
 Our lead product candidate from the CUE-100 framework, CUE-101, contains IL-2 and a pMHC composed of HLA-A*02:01 complexed with a dominant peptide derived from the human papilloma virus E7 protein (HPV-E7).  It is a fusion protein biologic designed to target and activate antigen-specific T cells to fight HPV-driven cancers.
 HPV cancers account for more than 20,000 deaths each year in the US and Europe. The majority of these cancers are driven by HPV-16 which carries the E7 antigen targeted by CUE-101. Despite treatment with current standards of care, approximately 50% of patients with advanced disease will experience recurrence and significant quality of life impact.  Patients with HPV-driven head and neck, cervical and genitoanal cancers represent an important unmet clinical need and underscore the opportunity for promising new therapeutics.

CUE-101

In Vitro Activity with CUE-101
 
In preclinical studies, we have demonstrated targeted engagement of CUE-101 specifically to tumor antigen specific CD8+T cells as well as induction of antigen specific T cell activation- and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)- cell surface marker changes as highlighted in figure below.  These data demonstrate that targeted engagement results preferential signaling activation and cytokine production by antigen-specific T cells. 
Figure 1: CUE-101 Selectivity and Specificity


Top Panel: CUE-101 selectively activates IL-2 signaling (as read by phosphorylated STAT5, pSTAT5, in T cells) in HPV-specific CD8+ T cells when compared to an irrelevant CMV Immuno-STAT (top-left panel). In contrast, the CMV Immuno-STAT preferentially activates IL-2 signaling in CMV-specific CD8+ T cells when compared to CUE-101 (top-right panel).
 Bottom Panel: CUE-101, and not the CMV Immuno-STAT, elicits interferon gamma (IFN) production from HPV-specific CD8+ T cells (bottom-left panel). As a control, the CMV Immuno-STAT only exhibited interferon gamma production from CMV-specific CD8+ T cells while CUE-101 did not (bottom-right panel).
 
In addition, CUE-101 has demonstrated expansion of antigen-specific T cells from donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (“PBMCs”) as a single agent, as highlighted in the below figure.  Notably, a measurable expansion of HPV-specific T cells is evident post-exposure to CUE-101 when compared to pre-treatment where this population is virtually undetectable.
 
8

Figure 2: CUE-101 Selective Expansion of HPV-Specific T Cells
 
CUE-101 specifically expands HPV-specific CD8+ T cells from a primary healthy individual. PBMCs from a healthy individual were treated with CUE-101 and the antigen-specific T cells were quantitated in the sample 10-14 days post expansion and were analyzed at 17 days post stimulation. A distinct population of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, as detected by HLA-A02 tetramers, was detectable post-expansion. 
Mechanistic Studies Supporting CUE-101
 In order to better understand the in vivo mechanism of action, we generated a murine surrogate, termed mCUE-101, and tested the same in the aggressive TC-1 tumor model, driven by the HPV E7 protein. The mCUE-101 is comprised of the murine class I MHC molecule bound to a peptide from the HPV E7 protein along with same IL-2 framework as in the human CUE-101 molecule. As shown in figure 3, treatment with mCUE-101 alone extended survival of mice bearing the TC1 tumor, while treatment with the anti-PD-1 antibody alone did not show any activity (survival curves for anti-PD-1 were approximately the same as the vehicle control animals). However, the combination of mCUE-101 with anti-PD-1 resulted in significant survival of tumor-bearing mice (~90% survival at d80). The notable activity with combination therapy suggested that mCUE-101 primed a robust repertoire of anti-tumor T cells, which subsequently may have undergone PD-1-dependent inhibition. In order to dissect the in vivo tumor response, we quantified the numbers of tumor-antigen-specific CD8+ T cells – in blood and in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (“TILS”) – at d15 post tumor engraftment. As shown in figure 3, reproducible detection of tumor specific T cells was evident in mice that received mCUE-101 – either alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 Monoclonal antibody (“mAb”). Notably no tumor-specific T cells were evident in mice treated with anti-PD-1 alone. Furthermore, deep profiling of T cells revealed the expression of PD-1 in tumor specific CD8+ T cells present in the tumor lesions, which provided a mechanistic explanation for the impressive activity noted in mCUE-101 treated animals that also received anti-PD-1 mAb. (figure 4).

Figure 3: Improved Survival in TC-1 Tumor Model 
 

A mouse surrogate Immuno-STAT, mCUE-101, was generated to evaluate for activity in the aggressive TC1 tumor model in B6 mice. Mice were implanted with syngeneic tumors and then treated for a short period with mCUE-101 alone, anti-PD-1 mAb alone, or combination of mCUE101 and anti-PD-1 mAb. As shown above, anti-PD-1 did not exhibit any notable activity while mCUE-101 alone extended survival significantly. Importantly, the combination of mCUE-101 and anti-PD-1 mAb demonstrated an impressive survival —– rate, as a majority of mice were alive at day 80 post tumor challenge.
 The detection of tumor-specific T cells provides a robust marker for translatability of the mechanistic basis for T cell induction in the clinic. Importantly, the presence of tumor-specific T cells in the tumors (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or “TILS”) further bolsters the significance of the platform and approach in directly activating and localizing T cells to the tumor site. The latter is an important measure of potential success for cancer immunotherapy approaches based on previous clinical data – i.e., patients that demonstrate presence of TILs (“hot tumor”) tend to respond better to immunotherapy interventions.
 Figure 4: Expression of Tumor-specific T Cells in Peripheral Blood and Tumor 
 

Selective expression of PD-1 in the tumor-infiltrating T cells provides a mechanistic explanation for the combination activity with mCUE-101 + anti-PD-1 treatment in the TC1 tumor model. PD-1 expression was measured on tumor-specific and non-tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in blood and the tumor infiltrating T cells in mice treated with mCUE-101. T cell expression of PD-1 from blood and tumor infiltrating T cells from five independent mice is shown. In each instance, notable expression of PD-1 was evident among the tumor-specific T cells in the tumors.
 10

A key question pertaining to a robust anti-tumor T cell response is to determine whether long-term immunological memory is generated in the individual to provide protective immunity against future threats from tumor re-emergence. We evaluated this in the mouse TC1 model studies using the long-term protected mice (treated with mCUE-101+ anti-PD-1 mAb), as shown in figure 5. Mice that were tumor-free at day 80 post-treatment with mCUE-101 + anti-PD-1 mAb were re-challenged with a new inoculum of TC1 tumor cells. Naïve mice, i.e., animals that had never been treated with mCUE-101 + anti-PD-1 or received prior TC1 tumors, were used as controls. Figure 5 demonstrates that combination-treated mice (mCUE-101 + anti-PD-1 mAb) rejected a new challenge of TC1 tumors while all of the naïve animals succumbed to the tumor challenge. The tumor rejection by combination-treated mice was accomplished in absence of any additional treatment with mCUE-101 or anti-PD-1 mAb, i.e., the rejection was entirely driven by the established anti-tumor immune response, which was indicative of immunological memory.
 Figure 5: Induction of Immunological Memory: Re-challenge Study in Mice with TC1 Tumor Cells 


Long-term protected mice from prior treatment with mCUE-101 + anti-PD-1 mAb were re-challenged with TC1 tumors in absence of any further treatment. Naïve mice were used as positive controls. As shown in the figure above, all 5 of the long-term protected mice rejected a new tumor challenge while the naïve mice group exhibited tumor growth.
CUE-101 Clinical Development Plan
 Our initial CUE-101 Phase I protocol will focus on recurrent/metastatic (“R/M”) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (“HNSCC”), where patients will likely have received several lines of systemic therapy including checkpoint inhibition.  In addition, we plan to run a trial in the neoadjuvant setting for locally advanced HNSCC patients with resectable disease. This neoadjuvant study will offer the opportunity to assess relevant biomarkers of CUE-101 activity in peripheral blood and resected tumors in therapeutically naive patients, including infiltrating T cells.
 We view R/M HNSCC as an important first market opportunity for CUE-101 with the potential for accelerated approval. Our initial assessment suggests HPV-driven HNSCC is recognized as a distinct subtype of head and neck cancer that has steadily grown over the past 20 years.  We will also pursue opportunities to move into earlier lines of therapy within R/M and locally advanced head and neck cancers (both as a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibition).
 In addition to HNSCC, we also intend to pursue expansion studies for cervical cancers which we view as an attractive opportunity with significant unmet need and potentially other HPV-driven cancers (e.g., anal, vulvar, etc.). Outside of the US and EU, we will work with our partner LG Chem to commercialize CUE-101 in Asia.
 CUE-102
 CUE-102 leverages the CUE-100 framework and a pMHC derived from the Wilms’ Tumor protein (WT1), a non-viral antigen known to be over-expressed in a number of cancers, including solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. In 2019, we plan to initiate preclinical studies for this program in collaboration with our partner LG Chem Life Sciences.
 CUE-103
 CUE-103 will leverage the CUE-100 framework and target an antigen to be selected in collaboration with LG Chem Life Sciences.
 11

Chronic Infectious Disease
 CUE-200 Framework
 
The CUE-200 framework utilizes co-stimulatory cell surface receptors, including CD80 and/or 4-1BBL to reactivate exhausted T cells and is designed to promote enhanced antigen-specific T cell activation and function for the treatment of chronic infectious diseases.
 
In October 2018, we announced a collaboration with Einstein to expand the Immuno-STAT platform to address T cell exhaustion in chronic infectious disease. Through this collaboration we aim to leverage the modularity and selectivity of the platform to address chronic infectious diseases where overcoming T cell exhaustion has been a challenge.
 
The learnings from chronic infectious diseases will also impact the application of the CUE-200 framework in immuno-oncology. Both CD80/CD28 and 4-1BBL/4-1BB pathways have been implicated in enhancing anti-tumor T cell responses, including re-invigorating exhausted T cells. We see this as a unique opportunity to potentially harness and deploy these co-stimulatory signaling molecules to selectively modulate anti-tumor T cells.
 
Autoimmune Disease
 
CUE-300 Framework
 
The CUE-300 framework has the potential to target a broad range of addressable autoimmune diseases by selectively modulating disease-associated T cells so that healthy cells are protected from immune attack, without compromising the immune system. 
 
Immuno-STATs inhibit autoimmune disease-associated T cells via two general strategies:
 
 
• | Inhibition of autoreactive T cells by selectively delivering inhibitory signals; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selective expansion of antigen specific T cells (“Tregs”) to control aberrant activation of autoreactive T cells
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Immuno-STAT frameworks for autoimmune disease will be designed to influence a subset of T cells known as CD4 T cells. CD4 T cells recognize peptides in the context of MHC class II proteins. Therefore, prototypic Immuno-STAT frameworks in autoimmunity would rely on MHC class II recognition by CD4 T cells. This is distinct from the MHC class I recognition by CD8 T cells that is the basis of our current oncology pipeline.
 
Consistent with our plan to establish strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology organizations to further our development efforts, in November 2017 we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (“Merck”) for a partnership to research and develop proprietary biologics that target certain autoimmune diseases. We view this Collaboration Agreement as a component of our development strategy since it will allow us to advance our autoimmune programs in partnership with a world class pharmaceutical company, while also continuing our focus on our more advanced cancer programs. 
 
Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, in July 2018, we generated molecules that provided proof-of-concept and feasibility for the path forward for this program.
 
Our License Agreement with Einstein
 On January 14, 2015, we entered into a license agreement, as amended and restated on July 31, 2017 (the “Einstein License”), with Einstein for certain patent rights (the “Patents”) relating to the Company’s core technology platform for the engineering of biologics to control T cell activity, precision, immune-modulatory product candidates, and two supporting technologies that enable the discovery of costimulatory signaling molecules (ligands) and T cell targeting peptides. The Company holds an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, import, make, have made, use, provide, offer to sell, and sell all products, processes and services that use the Patents, including certain technology received from Einstein related thereto (the “Licensed Products”).
 12

The Einstein License is a royalty-bearing license obligating us to pay a percentage of proceeds received from sales of categories of Licensed Products at low single digit rates. We have also agreed to share a portion of our proceeds that we derive from other agreements, like sublicense agreements, relating to Licensed Products that we may enter into. The percentage of such proceeds that we are required to pay Einstein ranges from the low to high teens, depending on how far we have developed a Licensed Product before we enter into an agreement relating to the Licensed Product. These percentages are reduced for sales of Licensed Products in countries where a competing product exists and for products or services involving the use or incorporation of technology received from Einstein relating to synapse for targeted T cell activation molecules, receptor ligand identification or platforms for T cell monitoring. In addition to our obligation to pay royalties based upon a percentage of proceeds from sales of Licensed Products, we have also agreed to pay Einstein annual maintenance fees. The maintenance payments are creditable against any royalty payments we pay under the Einstein License. As of December 31, 2018, we had paid to Einstein an aggregate amount of $487,929 in license and license maintenance fees under the Einstein License.
 Under the Einstein License, we are also obligated to make milestone payments corresponding to: (i) approval of the first IND by the FDA or foreign equivalent for a Licensed Product; (ii) approval of any subsequent IND application or foreign equivalent for a “new indication” for a Licensed Product; (iii) initiation of Phase 2 clinical trials or foreign equivalent on a Licensed Product; (iv) initiation of Phase 2 clinical trials or foreign equivalent for a “new indication” for a Licensed Product; (v) initiation of Phase 3 clinical trials or foreign equivalent on a Licensed Product; (vi) initiation of Phase 3 clinical trials or foreign equivalent for a “new indication” for a Licensed Product, (vii) the first commercial sale of a Licensed Product; (viii) the first commercial sale of each “new indication” for one of our previously approved Licensed Products; and (ix) cumulative sales of certain Licensed Products reaching certain threshold amounts. The aggregate amount of milestone payments made under the Einstein License may equal up to $1.85 million for each Licensed Product and up to $1.85 million for each new indication of a Licensed Product. Additionally, the aggregate amount of one-time milestone payments based on cumulative sales of all Licensed Products may equal up to $5.75 million.
 In addition to our obligations to make the cash payments to Einstein described above, under the Einstein License we were required to issue Einstein 671,572 shares of our Common Stock immediately prior to completion of the initial public offering of our common stock completed on December 27, 2017.
 The Einstein License expires upon the expiration of our last obligation to make royalty payments to Einstein, unless terminated earlier under the provisions thereof. Under the Einstein License, we will be obligated to make royalty payments to Einstein, with respect to certain Licensed Products, for the longer of 15 years from the first sale of such products in each country or for the duration of any market exclusivity period granted by a regulatory agency for such product and, with respect to certain Licensed Products sold by sublicensees, the longer of 10 years from the first sale of such products in each country or for so long as the sublicensee agrees to pay royalties on such products. We have the right to terminate the Einstein License at any time upon sixty (60) days’ written notice to Einstein; provided, however, that we will lose intellectual property rights related to the Patents if we choose to terminate the Einstein License in this manner. Each party has the right to terminate the Einstein License if the other party is in default or breach of any condition of the Einstein License with a right to cure any such breach within sixty (60) days from receipt of notice of such default or breach, unless the other party has disputed the alleged breach in good faith. Either party can also terminate the Einstein License if the other party voluntarily files for bankruptcy or other similar insolvency proceedings, makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or is the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy petition that is not dismissed within ninety (90) days. If we fail to pay any sum that is due and payable to Einstein within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of our default from Einstein, then Einstein has the option of terminating the Einstein License unless we pay within forty-five (45) days of such notice all delinquent sums with interest. 
Einstein may also terminate the Einstein License in the event we are convicted of certain felonies relating to the manufacture or use of Licensed Products.
 The Einstein License also obligates us to meet certain due diligence requirements (the “Diligence Milestones”) as follows:
  
• | update our research and development plan annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | submit an IND application to the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agency within a number of years from the Effective Date;

 If we fail to meet any of the Diligence Milestones, Einstein will have the right to terminate the Einstein License if such Diligence Milestone is not satisfied within thirty (30) days from receiving a written notice of default from Einstein. Under certain circumstances and upon prior notice to Einstein, we may have the right to an additional extension of our Diligence Milestones if, despite our commercially reasonable efforts we are not able to satisfy the Phase 2 clinical trial Diligence Milestone or any subsequent Diligence Milestone. As of the date of this prospectus, we have met all required Diligence Milestones.
 Our Collaboration Agreement with Merck
 On November 14, 2017, we entered into an Exclusive Patent License and Research Collaboration Agreement (the “Merck Agreement”) with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (“Merck”) for a partnership to research and develop certain of the Company’s proprietary biologics that target certain autoimmune disease indications (the “Initial Indications”). We view this Merck Agreement as a component of our development strategy since it will allow us to advance our autoimmune programs in partnership with a world class pharmaceutical company, while also continuing our focus on our more advanced cancer programs. The research program outlined in the Merck Agreement entails (1) our research, discovery and development of certain Immuno-STAT drug candidates up to the point of demonstration of certain biologically relevant effects (“Proof of Mechanism”) and (2) the further development by Merck of the Immuno-STAT product candidates that have demonstrated Proof of Mechanism (the “Proposed Product Candidates”) up to the point of demonstration of all or substantially all of the properties outlined in such Proposed Product Candidates’ profiles as described in the Merck Agreement.
 For the purposes of this collaboration, we granted to Merck under the Merck Agreement an exclusive license under certain of our patent rights, including a sublicense of patent rights licensed from Einstein, to the extent applicable to the specific Immuno-STAT product candidates that are elected to be developed by Merck. From the effective date of the Merck Agreement until the earlier of (i) the first achievement of Proof of Mechanism for a Immuno-STAT product candidate or (ii) 18 months after we notify the joint steering committee that the first Product Candidate has been synthesized under the research program, we are required to forebear from researching, developing or licensing to a third party rights related to any Immuno-STAT product candidate for the treatment of autoimmune diseases other than pursuant to the Merck Agreement. On July 12, 2018, we announced the generation of the first Product Candidate establishing the end-date of the forbearance period as no later than December 14, 2019. In addition, so long as Merck continues product development on a Proposed Product Candidate, we are restricted from conducting any development activities within the Initial Indication covered by such Proposed Product Candidate other than pursuant to the Merck Agreement. We are not required to forbear at any time, however, from developing other Immuno-STAT for use in therapeutic areas other than autoimmune diseases, e.g., for use in treating cancer or infectious diseases.
 In exchange for the licenses and other rights granted to Merck under the Merck Agreement, we received a $2.5 million nonrefundable up-front payment and may be eligible to receive additional funding in developmental milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties if all research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones agreed upon by both parties are successfully achieved. Excluding the upfront payment described above, we are eligible to earn up to $101 million for the achievement of certain research and development milestones, $120 million for the achievement of certain regulatory milestones and $150 million for the achievement of certain commercial milestones, in addition to tiered royalties on sales, if all pre-specified milestones associated with multiple products across the primary disease indication areas are achieved. The Merck Agreement requires us to use the first $2.7 million of milestone payments we receive under the agreement to fund contract research. The amount of the royalty payments is a percentage of product sales ranging in the single digits based on the amount of such sales.
 The term of the Merck Agreement extends until the expiration of all royalty obligations following a product candidate’s receipt of marketing authorization, at which point Merck’s licenses and sublicenses granted under the agreement shall become fully paid-up, perpetual licenses and sublicenses, as applicable. Royalties on each product subject to the Merck Agreement shall continue on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the later of: (1) the last-to-expire patent claiming the compound on which such product is based and (2) a period of ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merck may terminate the Merck Agreement at any time upon 30 days’ notice to the Company. The Merck Agreement may also be terminated by either party if the other party is in breach of its obligations thereunder and 
 14

fails to cure such breach within 90 days after notice or by either party if the other party files for bankruptcy or other similar insolvency proceedings.
 Our Collaboration Agreement with LG Chem
 Effective November 6, 2018, we entered into a Collaboration, License and Option Agreement (the “LG Chem Agreement”) with LG Chem, Ltd. (“LG Chem”), related to the development of  Immuno-STATs focused in the field of oncology.
 Pursuant to the LG Chem Agreement, we granted LG Chem an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize our lead product, CUE-101, as well as Immuno-STATs that target T-cells against two additional cancer antigens (“Product Candidates”), in Australia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, China (including Macau and Hong Kong) and Taiwan (collectively, the “LG Chem Territory”). We retain rights to develop and commercialize all assets included in the LG Chem Agreement in the United States and in global markets outside of the LG Chem Territory. Under the LG Chem Agreement, we will engineer the selected Immuno-STATs for up to three alleles, which are expected to include the predominant alleles in the LG Chem Territory, thereby enhancing Cue’s market reach by providing for greater patient coverage of populations in global markets, while LG Chem will establish a chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) process for the development and commercialization of selected Product Candidates. In addition, LG Chem has the option to select one additional Immuno-STAT for an oncology target (an “Additional Immuno-STAT”) within two years of the effective date of the LG Chem Agreement for an exclusive worldwide development and commercialization license. If LG Chem exercises this option, then the parties will execute a license and collaboration agreement (“Global License and Collaboration Agreement”) setting forth the terms and conditions relating to such arrangement. We will retain an option to co-develop and co-commercialize the additional program worldwide. 
 Under the terms of the LG Chem Agreement, LG Chem paid us a$5.0 million non-refundable, non-creditable upfront payment and purchased approximately $5.0 million of shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to a twenty percent (20%) premium to the volume weighted-average closing price per share over the thirty (30) trading day period immediately prior to the effective date of the LG Chem Agreement. We are also eligible to receive additional aggregate payments of approximately $400 million if certain research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones are successfully achieved. In addition, the LG Chem Agreement also provides that LG Chem will pay us tiered single-digit royalties on net sales of commercialized Product Candidates (“Collaboration Products”)  in the LG Chem Territory on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the later of expiration of patent rights in a country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or ten years after the first commercial sale of a Collaboration Product in such country, subject to certain royalty step-down provisions set forth in the LG Chem Agreement.
 Pursuant to the LG Chem Agreement, the parties will share research costs related to Collaboration Products, and LG Chem will provide CMC process development for selected Product Candidates and potentially additional downstream manufacturing capabilities, including clinical and commercial supply for Collaboration Products.  In return for performing CMC process development, LG Chem is eligible to receive low-single digit royalty payments on the sales of Collaboration Products sold in all countries outside the LG Chem Territory. Furthermore, should the parties enter into a Global License and Collaboration Agreement for an Additional Immuno-STAT, LG Chem will pay us a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable upfront payment and we will be eligible to receive up to approximately $470 to $675 million in fees and milestone payments as well as tiered royalty payments on future global sales that range from high-single digits to mid-double digit teens in the United States and mid-single to low-double digits outside of the United States.  The amount of fees and milestone payments, as well as whether we receive royalty payments, will depend on when LG Chem nominates the Additional Immuno-STAT, the number of alleles selected by LG Chem and whether we exercise our option to co-develop and co-commercialize the additional program worldwide, in which case we would share costs and profits instead of receiving royalties and post-option-exercise milestones.
 The LG Chem Agreement includes various representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and other customary provisions. LG Chem may terminate the LG Chem Agreement for convenience or change of control of the Company on a program-by-program, product-by-product or country-by-country basis, or in its entirety, at any time following the notice period set forth in the LG Chem Agreement. Either party may terminate the LG Chem Agreement, in its entirety or on a program-by-program, product-by-product or country-by-country basis, in the event of an uncured material breach. The LG Chem Agreement is also terminable by either party (i) upon the bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation of the other party or (ii) for certain activities involving the challenge of certain patents controlled by the other party. Unless earlier terminated, the LG Chem Agreement will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the applicable royalty term.
 Our Intellectual Property
 We believe that our current patents and patent applications and any future patents and other proprietary rights that we own, or control through licensing, are and will be essential to our business. We believe that these intellectual property rights will affect 
 15

our ability to compete effectively with others. We also rely and will rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We seek to protect these, in part, through confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants, advisors and other parties. Our success will depend in part on our ability, and the ability of our licensor, to obtain, maintain (including making periodic filings and payments) and enforce patent protection for our/their intellectual property, including those patents and patent applications to which we have secured exclusive rights.
 As of December 31, 2018, we owned or had licensed two patents, twenty pending patent applications in the United States (including twelve pending U.S. provisional patent applications), eight pending international PCT applications and 73 pending foreign patent applications intended to protect the intellectual property underlying our technology. Our patent applications describe certain features of our technologies, including our Immuno-STAT platform, MOD screening, viraTope™, and MOD variants, as well as specific biologic molecules, product candidates, and methods of treatment using our Immuno-STATs. We plan to spend considerable resources and focus in the future on obtaining U.S. and foreign patents. We have and will continue to actively protect our intellectual property. No assurances can be given that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or that the examination process will not require us to narrow our claims. In addition, any issued patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to successfully enforce our patent rights against third parties. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop a similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us. We intend to expand our international operations in the future and our patent portfolio, copyright, trademark and trade secret protections may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
 Each of our patents, if and when granted, will generally have a term of 20 years from its respective U.S. non-provisional priority filing date, subject to available extensions. They are thus set to expire no earlier than dates ranging from 2033 to 2038, although there can be no assurance that any of the patent applications will be granted.
 
Competition
 While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge and experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. 
 Furthermore, immunotherapy technologies are advancing at a rapid pace and we anticipate competing with companies developing bi-specific antibodies (e.g., Amgen, Inc., Hoffmann-La Roche and Sutro Biopharma), CAR-T therapies (e.g., Novartis A.G., Juno Therapeutics and Kite Pharma, Inc.), checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co. and Pfizer, Inc.), antibody drug conjugates (e.g., Seattle Genetics, Inc., ImmunoGen, Inc. and Sorrento Therapeutics), and targeted cytokines (e.g., Nektar/Bristol Myers Squibb and Hoffmann-La Roche) many of which have significantly greater financial and other resources than we have.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Biological products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letters, import detentions, fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals or clearances, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, denial of export applications, and criminal prosecution. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals or the restriction, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or clearances, as well as any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In connection with regulatory approval, we will have to comply with the many requirements associated with preclinical and clinical trials, the FDA Biologics License Application (“BLA”) process and FDA manufacturing requirements.  Upon approval of a BLA by the FDA and similar approvals in foreign countries, there will be additional regulation relating to the manufacturing, packaging, distribution, labeling, marketing and promotion of our potential products. These latter regulations are not only found in federal regulation but many states and, of course, foreign countries.
 16

U.S. Biologic Product Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), the Public Health Services Act (the “PHSA”) and implementing regulations. The FDCA, PHSA and their implementing regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distributing, marketing and promotion of biologic products. Biologic products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal (in vivo) studies in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices (“GLPs”) and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (an “IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before ach clinical trial may be conducted;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”), and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the biological product candidate for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Marketing Practices (“cGMP”) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current Good Tissue Practices (“cGTPs”) for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of applicable user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
 17

Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (an “IRB”) at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee (an “IBC”), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into human subjects to test for safety (adverse effects), determine recommended Phase 2 dosing and evaluate any signals of efficacy for specific targeted diseases. The initial human testing is often conducted in patients, rather than in healthy volunteers, in the case of products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is inherently toxic.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify safety risks, optimize dosing and preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the National Institutes of Health and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, as well as any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immunotherapy trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Cancer immunotherapy products are a relatively new category of biologic products for the FDA. As a result,  there can be no assurance as to the length of the clinical trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of immunotherapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
 18

Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the biologic product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. FDA BLA Review and Approval Processes
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (the “PDUFA”), each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biological products and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For immunotherapy products, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the cGTPs, to the extent applicable. These are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products (“HCT/Ps”), which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cellular tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, cGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 19

If a product receives FDA regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (the “PREA”), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s).
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy Designation, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing products, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, products that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of products to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre-BLA. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is available for products that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the end-of-Phase 2 meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Breakthrough Therapy Designation conveys all of the Fast Track program features along with more intensive FDA guidance and interaction and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Priority review, which is requested at the time of BLA or NDA submission, is designed to give products that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy Designation and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to expedite review of the application. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of products to treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. Discussions with the FDA about the feasibility of an accelerated approval typically begin early in the development of the product in order to identify, among other things, an appropriate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether the drug or biologic is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to seven years of orphan product exclusivity. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a product containing the same active moiety for the same disease, except in very limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Thus, orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our potential products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the 
 20

same product as defined by the FDA and we are not able to show the clinical superiority of our product candidate or if our product candidate’s indication is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product orphan indication. In addition, the FDA will not recognize orphan drug exclusivity if a sponsor fails to demonstrate upon approval that the product is clinically superior to a previously approved product containing the same active moiety for the same orphan condition, regardless of whether or not the approved product was designated an orphan drug or had orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.  Thus, orphan dug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our potential products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA and we are not able to show the clinical superiority of our product candidate or if our product candidate’s indication is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product orphan indication.  In addition, if the FDA grants orphan drug designation, after the drug receives marketing approval for the designated use, in order to receive orphan drug exclusive approval for such use, the sponsor must demonstrate that the drug is actually clinically superior to any previously approved same drug for the same use.  Any claims for clinical superiority could require a head-to-head clinical trial between such drugs.
 U.S. FDA Post-Approval Requirements
 Any potential biologic products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, GMO regulations, including record-keeping and documentation requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe FDA approved products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, it is FDA’s position that manufacturers may not market or promote products for such off-label uses.
 In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the quality and long-term stability of the product. We expect to rely on third parties for the manufacturing of clinical and commercial quantities of our potential products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our potential products under development.
 Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. FDA requirements at any time during the biologic product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These actions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of clinical trials by an IRB, warning or untitled letters, recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising and promotion or communications to healthcare professionals or patients, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the “BPCIA”) amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its molecule as highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, among other requirements. The BPCIA, however, bars the FDA from approving biosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator biological product 
 21

receives initial marketing approval. This 12-year period of data exclusivity may be extended by six months, for a total of 12.5 years, if the FDA requests that the innovator company conduct pediatric clinical investigations of the product.
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patent applications, if granted, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 Other Health Care Laws and Regulations
 In the United States, among other things, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of biologic products are potentially subject to regulation and enforcement by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. Our current and future business activities, including for example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with health care regulatory laws, as applicable, which may include the following: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other;

• | the federal False Claims Act or FCA, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may implicate the FCA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare professionals and their immediate family members;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to: items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare professionals and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare professionals or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Other Regulations
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.  We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 46 full-time employees and one part-time employee. Substantially all of our employees are in Cambridge, Massachusetts. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and other third parties to assist with various aspects of our drug and product development.
Status as an Emerging Growth Company
 We are an “emerging growth company” as that term is defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until. private companies (i.e., those that have not had a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are required to comply with such new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period provided by Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of this extended transition period provided by Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. Even though we have elected to opt out of the extended transition period, we may still take advantage of all of the other provisions of the JOBS Act, which include, but are not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
