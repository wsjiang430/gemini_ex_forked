Overview
We are an agribusiness and real estate development company founded and based in Santa Paula, California, committed to responsibly using and managing our approximately 14,500 acres of land, water resources and other assets to maximize long-term stockholder value. Our current operations consist of fruit production, sales and marketing, rental operations, real estate development and capital investment activities.
We are one of California’s oldest citrus growers. According to Sunkist Growers, Inc. (“Sunkist”), we are one of the largest growers of lemons in the United States and, according to the California Avocado Commission, one of the largest growers of avocados in the United States. In addition to growing lemons and avocados, we grow oranges and a variety of specialty citrus and other crops. We have agricultural plantings throughout Ventura, Tulare, San Bernardino and San Luis Obispo Counties in California, Yuma County in Arizona and La Serena, Chile, which collectively consist of approximately 5,000 acres of lemons, 900 acres of avocados, 1,600 acres of oranges and 1,000 acres of specialty citrus and other crops. We also operate our own packinghouses in Santa Paula and Oxnard, California and Yuma, Arizona, where we process, pack and sell lemons that we grow, as well as lemons grown by others. We have a 47% interest in Rosales S.A. (“Rosales”), a citrus packing, marketing and sales business, a 90% interest in Fruticola Pan de Azucar S.A. (“PDA”), a lemon and orange orchard and 100% interest in Fruticola San Pablo S.A. ("San Pablo"), a lemon and orange orchard, all of which are located near La Serena, Chile.
Our water resources include water rights, usage rights and pumping rights to the water in aquifers under, and canals that run through, the land we own. Water for our farming operations is sourced from the existing water resources associated with our land, which includes rights to water in the adjudicated Santa Paula Basin (aquifer) and the un-adjudicated Fillmore and Paso Robles Basins (aquifers). We use ground water from the San Joaquin Valley Basin and water from local water and irrigation districts in Tulare County, which is in California’s San Joaquin Valley. We also use ground water from the Cadiz Valley Basin in California’s San Bernardino County and surface water in Arizona from the Colorado River through the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District (“YMIDD”). We use ground water provided by wells and surface water for our PDA and San Pablo farming operations in Chile.
For more than 100 years, we have been making strategic investments in California agriculture and real estate development. We currently have three real estate development projects in California. These projects include multi-family housing and single-family homes comprising approximately 260 completed rental units and another approximately 1,500 units in various stages of planning and development.
Fiscal Year 2018 Highlights and Recent Developments
On November 10, 2015, we entered into a joint venture with The Lewis Group of Companies (“Lewis”) for the residential development of our East Area I real estate development project. To consummate the transaction, we formed Limoneira Lewis Community Builders, LLC (the "LLC" or "Joint Venture"). The first phase of the project broke ground to commence mass grading on November 8, 2017. Project plans include approximately 632 residential units in Phase 1. Grading began in November 2017 and Phase 1 site improvements have begun. The Joint Venture has received lot deposits from national homebuilders and initial closings of lot sales are anticipated to begin in the first quarter of calendar year 2019.
In January 2018, the Joint Venture entered into a $45.0 million unsecured Line of Credit Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (the “Loan”) with Bank of America, N.A. to fund early development activities. The Loan matures in January 2020, with an option to extend the maturity date until 2021, subject to certain conditions. The interest rate on the Loan is LIBOR plus 2.85%, payable monthly. The Loan contains certain customary default provisions and the Joint Venture may prepay any amounts outstanding under 
4

the Loan without penalty. In February 2018, the obligations under the Loan were guaranteed by certain principals from Lewis and by the Company.
In February 2013, we entered into an option agreement for the purchase of a 7-acre parcel adjacent to its East Area II real estate development project. We made a $75,000 initial option payment in 2013 and four additional annual option payments of $50,000 each from 2014 to 2017. In February 2018, we exercised our option and purchased the property for $3.1 million, by making a cash payment of $1.4 million and issuing a note payable for $1.4 million. The $0.3 million of option payments were applied to the purchase price and we incurred $9,000 of transaction costs. The note payable is due in five years, with interest-only, monthly payments at interest rates ranging from 5.0% to 7.0%.
In August 2017, we entered an agreement to sell the commercial portion of our Sevilla property for approximately $1.5 million. This transaction closed in November 2017, we received net proceeds of $1.4 million and we recognized a gain of approximately $10,000.
In October 2017, we entered an agreement to sell our Centennial Square ("Centennial") property for approximately $3.3 million. This transaction closed December 2017 and we received net proceeds of $0.2 million and issued a $3.0 million promissory note secured by the property for the balance of the purchase price. The promissory note was originally scheduled to mature in June 2018 but provides for potential extensions to December 2019. After transaction costs, the sale resulted in a gain of $0.2 million, most of which has been deferred until repayment of the promissory note. In fiscal year 2018, per the terms of the promissory note, the holder of the note made two nonrefundable $0.1 million payments to us, extending the due date to December 30, 2018. In November 2018, the holder of the note made a nonrefundable $0.1 million payment to us, extending the due date to December 15, 2019.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 34% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of November 2, 2017 and December 31, 2017. We have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act on our year-end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the Act and guidance and as a result of the rate reduction, we have decreased our deferred tax liability balance as of October 31, 2018 by approximately $10.3 million.
In June 2018, we completed the sale of 3,136,000 shares of common stock, at a price of $22.00 per share to institutional and other investors in a registered offering under our shelf registration statement. The offering represented 18% of our outstanding common stock on an after-issued basis. Upon completion of the offering and issuance of common stock, we had 17,669,000 shares of common stock outstanding. The gross proceeds of the offering totaled $69.0 million and after an underwriting discount of $4.5 million and other offering expenses of $0.4 million, the net proceeds were $64.1 million. In June and July 2018, we used the offering proceeds to pay down debt, purchase the San Pablo ranch, and purchase the Oxnard Lemon Associates, Ltd's ("Oxnard Lemon") packinghouse, related land and certain other assets.
In July 2018, we completed the acquisition of San Pablo ranch and related assets in La Serena, Chile, for $13.1 million. The San Pablo ranch consists of 3,317 total acres on two parcels, including 247 acres producing lemons, 61 acres producing oranges, the opportunity to immediately plant 120 acres for lemon production, as well as the potential for approximately 500 acres of avocado production.
In July 2018, we entered into an agreement to purchase Oxnard Lemon for $25.0 million. Pursuant to the agreement, we acquired certain “hard assets” of Oxnard Lemon, including a packinghouse and related land for a purchase price of $24.7 million on July 26, 2018. Pursuant to the agreement, the closing on the purchase and sale of the “soft assets” of Oxnard Lemon, including trade names, trademarks and copyrights, took place on October 31, 2018, at which point an additional $0.3 million in purchase price was paid. Additionally, the agreement provided that the sellers lease back the “hard assets” from July 26, 2018 until October 31, 2018, pursuant to a lease agreement executed July 26, 2018.
Late in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, Ventura County experienced record high temperatures. We expect that the effect of these high temperatures will result in lower avocado crop volume in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018.
In October 2018, we sold 50,000 shares of Calavo Growers, Inc. (“Calavo”) common stock at an average price of $94.47 per share. Net proceeds from the sale were $4.7 million and we recognized a gain of $4.2 million. We continue to own 250,000 shares of Calavo common stock.

In October 2018, we began negotiations to sell both our The Terraces at Pacific Crest ("Pacific Crest") property and the remaining residential portion of our Sevilla property for $5.2 million. As a result, based on the estimated selling prices, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million. As of the date of the filing, these transactions are still in negotiations.
On December 18, 2018, we declared a cash dividend of $0.075 per common share payable on January 15, 2019, in the aggregate amount of $1.3 million to stockholders of record as of December 31, 2018. This represents a 20% increase in our dividend compared to 2018.
Business Division Summary
We have three business divisions: agribusiness, rental operations and real estate development. The agribusiness division is comprised of four reportable segments: fresh lemons, lemon packing, avocados and other agribusiness, and includes our farming, harvesting, lemon packing and sales operations. The rental operations division includes our residential and commercial rentals, leased land operations and organic recycling. The real estate development division includes our real estate projects and development. Financial information and discussion of our six reportable segments, which includes fresh lemons, lemon packing, avocados, other agribusiness, rental operations and real estate development, are contained in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report.
Agribusiness Division
The agribusiness division is comprised of four of our reportable segments: fresh lemons, lemon packing, avocados and other agribusiness, which represented approximately 96%, 96% and 95% of our fiscal year 2018, 2017 and 2016 consolidated revenues, respectively, of which fresh lemons and lemon packing combined represented approximately 80%, 78% and 76% of our fiscal year 2018, 2017 and 2016 consolidated revenues, respectively.
Farming
We are one of California’s oldest citrus growers and one of the largest growers of lemons and avocados in the United States. In addition to growing lemons and avocados, we grow oranges and a variety of specialty citrus and other crops. We have agricultural plantings throughout Ventura, Tulare, San Bernardino and San Luis Obispo Counties in California, Yuma County in Arizona and La Serena, Chile, which collectively consist of approximately 5,000 acres of lemons, 900 acres of avocados, 1,600 acres of oranges and 1,000 acres of specialty citrus and other crops. With the acquisition of PDA and San Pablo, we have approximately 500 acres of lemon and oranges plantings in Chile. We also operate our own packinghouses in Santa Paula and Oxnard, California and Yuma, Arizona, where we process, pack and sell lemons we grow as well as lemons grown by others.
Lemons.  Our lemon farming is included in our “fresh lemons” and “lemon packing” reportable segments within our financial statements. We market and sell lemons directly to food service, wholesale and retail customers throughout the United States, Canada, Asia, Australia and certain other international markets. We are one of the largest lemon growers in the United States with approximately 5,000 acres of lemons planted primarily in Ventura, Tulare and San Bernardino Counties in California and in Yuma County, Arizona. In California, the lemon growing area stretches from the Coachella Valley to Fresno and Monterey Counties, with the majority of the growing areas being located in the coastal areas from Ventura County to Monterey County. Ventura County is California’s top lemon producing county. Approximately 35% of our lemons are grown in Ventura County, 25% are grown in Tulare County, 25% are grown in Yuma County, Arizona and 10% are grown in San Bernardino County, California. We also grow approximately 5% of our lemons near La Serena, Chile.
There are over fifty varieties of lemons, with the Lisbon, Eureka and Genoa being the predominant varieties marketed on a worldwide basis.  California-grown lemons are available throughout the year, with peak production periods occurring from January through August. Approximately 85% of our lemon plantings are of the Lisbon and Eureka varieties and approximately 15% are of other varieties such as sweet Meyer lemons, proprietary seedless lemons and pink variegated lemons. The storage life of fresh lemons generally ranges from 1 to 18 weeks, depending upon the maturity of the fruit, the growing methods used and the handling conditions in the distribution chain.
With an average annual production of approximately 800,000 tons of lemons, California accounts for approximately 90% of the United States lemon crop, with Arizona producing the majority of the rest. Approximately 70% of the United States lemon crop is utilized in the fresh market, with the remainder going to the processed market for products such as juice, oils and essences. Most lemons are consumed as either a cooking ingredient, a garnish, or as juice in lemonade or carbonated beverages or other drinks. Demand for lemons is typically highest in the summer, although California producers through various geographical zones are typically able to harvest lemons year-round.
6

Avocados.  Our avocado farming is included in our “avocados” reportable segment within our financial statements. We are one of the largest avocado growers in the United States with approximately 900 acres of avocados planted throughout Ventura County. In California, the avocado growing area stretches from San Diego County to Monterey County, with the majority of the growing areas located approximately 100 miles north and south of Los Angeles County.
Over the last 75 years, the avocado has transitioned from a single specialty fruit to an array of 10 varieties ranging from the green-skinned Zutanos to the black-skinned Hass, which is the predominant avocado variety marketed on a worldwide basis. California-grown avocados are available year-round, with peak production periods occurring between February and September. Other avocado varieties have a more limited picking season and typically command a lower price. Because of superior eating quality, the Hass avocado has contributed greatly to the avocado’s growing popularity through its retail, restaurant and other food service uses. Approximately 95% of our avocado plantings are of the Hass variety. The storage life of fresh avocados generally ranges from one to four weeks, depending upon the maturity of the fruit, the growing methods used and the handling conditions in the distribution chain.
We provide all of our avocado production to Calavo, a packing and marketing company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol CVGW. Calavo’s customers include many of the largest retail and food service companies in the United States and Canada. Our marketing relationship with Calavo dates back to 2003. Calavo receives fruit from our orchards at its packinghouse located in Santa Paula, California. Calavo’s proximity to our agricultural operations enables us to keep transportation and handling costs to a minimum. Our avocados are packed by Calavo and sold and distributed under its own brands to its customers primarily in the United States and Canada.
Primarily due to differing soil conditions, the care of avocado trees is intensive and during our 75-year history of growing avocados, growing techniques have changed dramatically. The need for more production per acre to compete with foreign sources of supply has required us to take an important lead in the practice of dense planting (typically four times the number of avocado trees per acre versus traditional avocado plantings) and mulching composition to help trees acclimate under conditions that more closely resemble those found in the tropics, a better climate for avocado growth.
Oranges.  Our orange farming is included in our “other agribusiness” reportable segment within our financial statements. While we are primarily known for our high-quality lemons, we also grow oranges. We have approximately 1,600 acres of oranges planted primarily in Tulare County, California. In California, the growing area for oranges stretches from Imperial County to Yolo County. For many decades, the Valencia variety of oranges was grown in Ventura County primarily for export to the Pacific Rim. Throughout the late twentieth century, developing countries began producing the larger, seedless Navel variety of oranges that successfully competed against the smaller Valencia variety. California-grown Navel oranges are available from October to June, with peak production periods occurring between January and April. California-grown Valencia oranges are available from March to October, with peak production periods occurring between June and September. Approximately 95% of our orange plantings are of the Navel variety and approximately 5% are of the Valencia variety.
Navel oranges comprise most of California’s orange crop, accounting for approximately 80% over the past three growing seasons. Valencia oranges account for a vast majority of the remainder of California’s orange crop. While California produces approximately 40% of the nation’s oranges, its crop accounts for approximately 90% of those going to the fresh market. The share of California’s crop going to fresh market, as opposed to the processed market (i.e., juices, oils and essences) varies by season, depending on the quality of the crop. We estimate approximately 70% of our oranges are sold to retail customers and approximately 30% are sold to wholesale customers.
Specialty Citrus and Other Crops. Our specialty citrus and other crop farming is included in our “other agribusiness” reportable segment within our financial statements. A few decades ago, we began growing specialty citrus varieties and other crops that we believed would appeal to changing North American and worldwide demand. As a result, we currently have approximately 1,000 acres of specialty citrus and other crops planted such as Moro blood oranges, Cara Cara oranges, Minneola tangelos, Star Ruby grapefruit, pummelos, pistachios and wine grapes.
Acreage devoted to specialty citrus and other crops in California has been growing significantly over the past few decades, especially with the popularity of the Clementine, a type of mandarin orange. Similar to our oranges, we utilize third-party packinghouses to process and pack our specialty citrus. A portion of our specialty citrus is marketed and sold under the Sunkist brand by Sunkist and orders are processed by Sunkist-member packinghouses. As an agricultural cooperative, Sunkist coordinates the sales and marketing of the specialty citrus and orders are processed by Sunkist-member packinghouses for direct shipment to customers.
We currently market our other crops, such as pistachios and wine grapes, utilizing processors which are not members of agricultural cooperatives. Our pistachios are harvested and sold to a roaster, packager and marketer of nuts, and our wine grapes are sold to various wine producers.

The Limoneira/Olivelands Ranch is the original site of our Company. Our headquarters, lemon packing operations and storage facilities are located on this property.
The Teague McKevett Ranch is the site of our real estate development project known as East Area I and described below under the “Real Estate Development Division” heading.
Windfall Farms - Creston, California. Windfall Farms is an approximately 700-acre former thoroughbred breeding farm and equestrian facility located in Creston, California, near Paso Robles, California. During fiscal years 2014 and 2015, we planted approximately 200 acres of vineyards and an additional 100 acres in 2017. Vineyards are generally productive after four years. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the vineyards produced their third harvest from the 2014 planting and their second harvest from the 2015 planting, generating approximately 600 tons of grapes and $0.9 million of revenue in 2018. We expect to sell vineyard production by the ton to various wineries with current per ton prices of approximately $1,500 depending on the grape variety and other factors.
Limco Del Mar is owned by a limited partnership of which we are the general partner and own an interest of 28.1%, which is comprised of a 1.3% general partner interest and a 26.8% limited partner interest.
We manage the Cadiz Ranches under operating lease arrangements. We purchased substantially all of the Sheldon Ranches property in two separate transactions, which closed in September and December 2015. We previously managed the Sheldon Ranches under operating lease arrangements.
The other agribusiness land in the table above includes corporate and lemon packing facilities, land leased to other agricultural businesses, rental units, roads, creeks, hillsides and other open land.
Our orchards can maintain production for many years. For financial reporting purposes, we depreciate our orchards from 20 to 40 years depending on the fruit variety with the majority of our orchards depreciated over 20 to 30 years. We regularly evaluate our orchards’ production and growing costs, and based on these and other factors we may decide to redevelop certain orchards. In addition, we may acquire agricultural property with existing productive orchards or without productive orchards, which would require new orchard plantings. The fruit varieties that we grow are typically non-producing for approximately the first four years after planting. Currently, we have 1,200 acres of lemons, 200 acres of oranges and 200 acres of specialty citrus and other crops

Lemon Packing and Sales
We are the oldest continuous lemon packing operation in North America. We pack and sell lemons grown by us as well as lemons grown by others, the operations of which are included in our financial statements under the lemon packing segment. Lemons delivered to our packinghouses in Santa Paula and Oxnard, California and Yuma, Arizona are sized, graded, cooled, ripened and packed for delivery to customers. Our ability to accurately estimate the size, grade and timing of the delivery of the annual lemon crop has a substantial impact on both our costs and the sales price we receive for the fruit.
A significant portion of the costs related to our lemon packing operation is fixed. Our strategy for growing the profitability of our lemon packing operations calls for optimizing the percentage of a crop that goes to the fresh market, or fresh utilization, and procuring a larger percentage of the California and Arizona lemon crop.
We invest considerable time and research into refining and improving our lemon packing through innovation and are continuously in search of new techniques to refine how premium lemons are delivered to our consumers. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, our new lemon packing facility became operational, which is expected to double our lemon packing capacity and has increased the efficiency and financial results of these operations.

Rental Operations Division
Our rental operations division is provided for in our financial statements as its own reportable segment and includes our residential and commercial rentals, leased land operations and organic recycling. The rental operations division represented approximately 4%, 4% and 5% of our fiscal year 2018, 2017 and 2016 consolidated revenues, respectively.
Residential
We own and maintain approximately 260 residential housing units located in Ventura and Tulare Counties in California that we lease to employees, former employees and non-employees. The December 2017 Southern California wildfires destroyed 14 mobile homes, which cost approximately $60,000 per unit to replace. In fiscal year 2015, we added 65 new agriculture workforce housing units in Santa Paula, California. These properties generate reliable cash flows which we use to partially fund the operating costs of our business and provide affordable housing for many of our employees and the community.
Commercial
We own several commercial office buildings and a multi-use facility consisting of a retail convenience store, gas station, car wash, and quick-serve restaurant. As with our residential housing units, these properties generate reliable cash flows which we use to partially fund the operating costs of our business.
Leased Land
As of October 31, 2018, we lease approximately 500 acres of our land to third-party agricultural tenants who grow a variety of row crops such as strawberries, raspberries, celery and cabbage. Our leased land business provides us with a profitable method to diversify the use of our land.
Organic Recycling
With the help of one of our tenants, Agromin, Inc. (“Agromin”), a processor of premium soil products and a green waste recycler located in Oxnard, California, we have implemented an organic recycling program. Agromin provides green waste recycling for cities in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. We worked with Agromin to develop an organic recycling facility on our land in Ventura County, to receive green materials (lawn clipping, leaves, bark and other plant materials) and convert such material into mulch that we spread throughout our agricultural properties to help curb erosion, improve water efficiency, reduce weeds and moderate soil temperatures. We receive a percentage of the gate fees Agromin collects from regional waste haulers and enjoy the benefits of the organic material.
Real Estate Development Division
Our real estate development division is provided for in our financial statements as its own reportable segment and includes our real estate development operations. The real estate development division had no significant revenues in fiscal years 2018, 2017 or 2016.
For more than 100 years, we have been making strategic real estate investments in California agricultural and developable real estate. Our current real estate developments include developable land parcels, multi-family housing and single-family homes with approximately 1,500 units in various stages of planning and development. The following is a summary of each of the strategic agricultural and development real estate investment properties in which we own an interest:
East Area I - Santa Paula, California. East Area I consists of 523 acres that we have used as agricultural land and is located in Santa Paula approximately ten miles from the City of Ventura and the Pacific Ocean. This property is also known as our Teague McKevett Ranch. We believe East Area I is an ideal location for a master planned community of commercial and residential properties designed to satisfy expected demand in a region that we believe will have few other developments in this coming decade. In 2008, after we completed a process of community planning and environmental review, the citizens of Santa Paula voted to approve the annexation of East Area I into Santa Paula. This vote was a requirement of the Save Open-Space and Agricultural Resources (“SOAR”), ordinance that mandates a public vote of the City of Santa Paula for land use conversion.
On November 10, 2015, we entered into the Joint Venture with Lewis for the residential development of our East Area I real estate development project. To consummate the transaction, we formed Limoneira Lewis Community Builders, LLC as the development entity, contributed our East Area I property to the Joint Venture and sold a 50% interest in the Joint Venture to Lewis for $20.0 million, comprised of a $2.0 million deposit received in September 2015 and $18.0 million received on November 10, 2015. We 
10

expect to receive $100.0 million from the Joint Venture over the estimated 7 to 10-year life of the project. The Joint Venture partners will share in capital contributions to fund project costs until loan proceeds and/or revenues are sufficient to fund the project. These funding requirements are currently estimated to total $15.0 to $20.0 million for each Joint Venture partner in the first three to four years of the project and we funded $3.5 million in fiscal year 2018, $7.5 million in fiscal year 2017 and an additional $4.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. We also entered into a lease agreement with the Joint Venture to lease back a portion of the contributed property, which allowed us to continue farming the property during the phased build-out of the project. We terminated this lease in December 2018. The first phase of the project broke ground to commence mass grading on November 8, 2017 and Phase 1 site improvements have begun. Project plans include approximately 632 residential units in Phase 1. The Joint Venture has received lot deposits from national homebuilders and initial closings of lot sales are anticipated to begin in the first quarter of calendar year 2019.
East Area II - Santa Paula, California.  We and our design associates are in the process of formulating plans for East Area II, a parcel of approximately 30 acres adjacent to East Area I, also a part of our Teague McKevett Ranch, that we believe is suited to commercial and/or industrial development along the south side of California Highway 126, a heavily traveled corridor that connects Highway 101 at Ventura on the west with Interstate 5 at Santa Clarita on the east. When completed, we expect that the development will contribute to the economic vitality of the region and allow residents to work and shop within close proximity to their homes.
The successful development of East Area II will be partly dependent on the success of East Area I described above. We expect that East Area II could accommodate large retailers, a medium or large employer, a complex of mixed business and retail, or some combination of the foregoing. We are actively cultivating prospects to become future tenants in East Area II and expect that development will closely follow the build-out of East Area I.
Santa Maria - Santa Barbara County, California.  As of October 31, 2018, we were invested in two entitled development parcels in Santa Barbara County, California, a county that, in our experience, entitles very few parcels. Located in Santa Maria, each of these parcels offers a residential and/or commercial development opportunity. A brief description of each parcel follows:

• | Pacific Crest is an approximately 8-acre parcel approved for 112 attached-housing units. In October 2018, we began negotiations to sell our Pacific Crest property.


• | Sevilla is approved for 69 single-family homes adjacent to shopping, transportation, schools, parks and medical facilities, with a parcel of approximately 3 acres zoned for commercial use. We sold the commercial portion of our Sevilla property in November 2017. In October 2018, we began negotiations to sell the residential portion of Sevilla.

Competitive Strengths
Agribusiness Division
With agricultural operations dating back to 1893, we are one of California’s oldest citrus growers and one of the largest growers of lemons and avocados in the United States. Consequently, we have developed significant experience with a variety of crops, mainly lemons, avocados and oranges. The following is a brief list of what we believe are our significant competitive strengths with respect to our agribusiness division, which includes our fresh lemons, lemon packing, avocados and other agribusiness segments unless otherwise noted:

• | Our agricultural properties in Ventura County are located near the Pacific Ocean, which provides an ideal environment for growing lemons, avocados and row crops. Our agricultural properties in Tulare County, which is in the San Joaquin Valley in Central California, and in Yuma, Arizona, are also located in areas that are well-suited for growing citrus crops.


• | Historically, a higher percentage of our crops go to the fresh market, which is commonly referred to as fresh utilization, than that of other growers and packers with which we compete.


• | We have contiguous and nearby land resources that permit us to efficiently use our agricultural land and resources.


• | In all but one of our properties, we are not dependent on State or Federal water projects to support our agribusiness or real estate development operations.


• | We own approximately 95% of our agricultural land and take a long view on our fruit production practices.


• | A significant amount of our agribusiness property was acquired many years ago, which results in a low-cost basis and associated expenses.


• | We have a well-trained and retentive labor force with many employees remaining with us for more than 30 years.

11


• | In our fresh lemons and lemon packing segments, our integrated business model with respect to growing, packing, marketing and selling lemons allows us to better serve our customers.


• | Our lemon packing operations provide marketing opportunities with other citrus companies and their respective products.


• | Since 2010, we have achieved and maintained GLOBALGAP Certification by successfully demonstrating our adherence to specific GLOBALGAP standards. GLOBALGAP is an internationally recognized set of farm standards dedicated to “Good Agricultural Practices” or GAP. We believe that GLOBALGAP Certification differentiates us from our competitors and serves as reassurance to consumers and retailers that food reaches acceptable levels of safety and quality, and has been produced sustainably, respecting the health, safety and welfare of workers and the environment, and in consideration of animal welfare issues.


• | We have made investments in ground-based solar projects that provide us with tangible and intangible non-revenue generating benefits. The electricity generated by these investments provides us with a significant portion of the electricity required to operate our packinghouse and cold storage facilities located in Santa Paula, California and provides a significant portion of the electricity required to operate four deep-water well pumps at one of our ranches in Tulare County, California. Additionally, these investments support our sustainable agricultural practices, reduce our dependence on fossil-based electricity generation and lower our carbon footprint. Moreover, electricity that we generate and do not use is conveyed seamlessly back to the investor-owned utilities operating in these two markets. Finally, over time, we expect that our customers and the end consumers of our fruit will value the investments that we have made in renewable energy as a part of our farming and packing operations, which we believe may help us differentiate our products from similar commodities.


• | We have made various other investments in water rights and mutual water companies. We own shares in the following mutual water companies: Farmers Irrigation Co., Canyon Irrigation Co., San Cayetano Mutual Water Co., Middle Road Mutual Water Co. and Pioneer Water Company, Inc. In 2007, we acquired additional water rights in the adjudicated Santa Paula Basin (aquifer) and in September 2013 we acquired water rights in the YMIDD with our acquisition of Associated Citrus Packers, Inc. (“Associated”). In February 2017, we acquired water rights with our purchase of 90% of PDA and in July 2018, we acquired additional water rights in Chile with our acquisition of San Pablo.

Rental Operations Division
With respect to our rental operations division, we believe our competitive advantages are as follows:

• | Our housing and land rentals provide a consistent, dependable source of cash flow that helps to counter the volatility typically associated with an agricultural business.


• | Our housing rental business allows us to offer a unique benefit to our employees, which in turn helps to provide us with a dependable, long-term employee base.


• | Our leased land business allows us to partner with other agricultural producers that can serve as a profitable alternative to under-producing tree crop acreage.


• | Our organic recycling tenant provides us with a low cost, environmentally friendly solution to weed and erosion control.

Real Estate Development Division
With respect to our real estate development division, we believe our competitive advantages are as follows:

• | Our real estate development activities are primarily focused in coastal areas north of Los Angeles and south of Santa Maria, which we believe have desirable climates for lifestyle families, retirees and athletic and sports enthusiasts.


• | We have entitlements to build approximately 1,500 residential units in our East Area I (Harvest at Limoneira) development.


• | We have partnered with an experienced and financially strong land developer for our East Area I residential master plan development.


• | Several of our agricultural and real estate investment properties are unique and carry longer-term development potential.


• | Our East Area II property has approximately 30 acres of land commercially zoned, which is adjacent to our East Area I property.

Business Strategy
While each of our business divisions has a separate business strategy, we are an agribusiness and real estate development company that generates annual cash flows to support investments in agricultural and real estate development activities.  As our agricultural and real estate development investments are monetized, we intend to seek to expand our agribusiness into new regions and markets and invest in cash-producing residential, commercial and industrial rental assets.
The following describes the key elements of our business strategy for each of our agribusiness, rental operations and real estate development business divisions.
Agribusiness Division
With respect to our agribusiness division, key elements of our strategy are:

• | Acquire Additional Lemon Producing Properties. To the extent attractive opportunities arise and our capital availability permits, we intend to consider the acquisition of additional lemon producing properties. In order to be considered, such properties would need to have certain characteristics to provide acceptable returns, such as an adequate source of water, a warm micro-climate and well-drained soils. We anticipate that the most attractive opportunities to acquire lemon producing properties will be in South America and in the San Joaquin Valley near our existing operations in Tulare County, California. 


• | Expand our Sources of Lemon Supply. Peak lemon production occurs at different times of the year depending on geographic region. In addition to our lemon production in California and Arizona and lemons we acquire from third-party growers, we have expanded our lemon supply sources to international markets such as Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Increases in lemons procured from third-party growers and international sources improve our ability to provide our customers with fresh lemons throughout the year. 


• | Increase the Volume of our Lemon Packing Operations. We regularly monitor our costs for redundancies and opportunities for cost reductions. In this regard, cost per carton is a function of throughput. We continually seek to acquire additional lemons from third-party growers to pack through our plants. Third-party growers are only added if we determine their fruit is of good quality and can be cost effective for both us and the grower. Of most importance is the overall fresh utilization rate for our fruit, which is directly related to quality. 


• | Expand International Production and Marketing of Lemons. We estimate that we currently have approximately 5% of the fresh lemon market in the United States and a larger share of the United States lemon export market. We intend to explore opportunities to expand our international production and marketing of lemons. We have the ability to supply a wide range of customers and markets and, because we produce high quality lemons, we can export our lemons to international customers, which many of our competitors are unable to supply. 


• | Construction of a New Lemon Packinghouse. Over the years, new machinery and equipment along with upgrades have been added to our nearly 80-year old packinghouse and cold storage facilities. This, along with an aggressive and proactive maintenance program, has allowed us to operate an efficient, competitive lemon packing facility. A project to double the capacity and increase the efficiency of our lemon packing facilities became operational in fiscal year 2016. We expect that this project will ultimately increase fresh lemon processing capacity and has lowered packing costs by reducing labor and handling inputs. 


• | Opportunistically Expand our Plantings of Oranges, Specialty Citrus and Other Crops. Our plantings of oranges, specialty citrus and other crops have been profitable and have been pursued to diversify our product line. Agricultural land that we believe is not suitable for lemons is typically planted with oranges, specialty citrus or other crops. While we intend to expand our orange, specialty citrus and other crops, we expect to do so on an opportunistic basis in locations that we believe offer a record of historical profitability. 


• | Opportunistically Expand our Plantings of Avocados. We may opportunistically expand our plantings of avocados primarily because our profitability and cash flow realized from our avocados frequently offset occasional losses in other crops we grow and help to diversify our fruit production base.


• | Maintain and Grow our Relationship with Calavo. Our alignment with and ownership stake in Calavo comprises our current marketing strategy for avocados. Calavo has expanded its sourcing into other regions of the world, including

13

Mexico, Chile and Peru, which allows it to supply avocados to its retail and food service customers on a year-round basis. California avocados occupy a unique market window in the year-round supply chain and Calavo has experienced a general expansion of volume as consumption has grown. Thus, we intend to continue to have a strong and viable market for our California avocados as well as an equity participation in Calavo’s overall expansion and profitability.

• | Diversify our Agribusiness Portfolio with the Development of a Vineyard at Windfall Farms. Our Windfall Farms property has approximately 500 acres suitable for vineyard development. During fiscal years 2014 and 2015, we planted approximately 200 acres of vineyards and an additional 100 acres in fiscal year 2017. We intend to continue to plant vineyards at the property up to the 500 suitable acres. We believe the vineyards are consistent with our agribusiness strategy and provide diversification to our crop production and operating results.

Rental Operations Division
With respect to our rental operations division, key elements of our strategy include the following:

• | Secure Additional Rental and Housing Units. Our housing, commercial and land rental operations provide us with a consistent, dependable source of cash flow that helps to fund our overall activities. Additionally, we believe our housing rental operation allows us to offer a unique benefit to our employees. We have built and leased 65 out of a total of 71 approved additional units through infill projects on existing sites and groupings of units on new sites within our owned acreage. 


• | Opportunistically Lease Land to Third-Party Crop Farmers. We regularly monitor the profitability of our fruit-producing acreage to ensure acceptable per acre returns. When we determine that leasing the land to third-party row crop farmers would be more profitable than farming the land, we intend to seek third-party row crop tenants. 


• | Opportunistically Expand our Income-Producing Commercial and Industrial Rental Assets. We intend to redeploy our future financial gains to acquire additional income-producing real estate investments and agricultural properties. 

Real Estate Development Division
With respect to our real estate development division, key elements of our strategy include:

• | Selectively and Responsibly Develop our Agricultural Land. We recognize that long-term strategies are required for successful real estate development activities. We thus intend to maintain our position as a responsible agricultural landowner and major employer in Ventura County while focusing our real estate development activities on those agricultural land parcels that we believe offer the best opportunities to demonstrate our long-term vision for our community. 


• | Opportunistically Increase our Real Estate Holdings. We intend to redeploy our future financial gains to acquire additional income-producing real estate investments and agricultural properties. 

Customers
With respect to our fresh lemons and lemon packing segments, we have marketed and sold our lemons directly to our food service, wholesale and retail customers in the United States, Canada, Asia, Australia and certain other international markets since 2010. Previously, Sunkist marketed and sold the majority of our lemons. We sold lemons to approximately 200 U.S. and international customers during fiscal year 2018. In terms of our avocado segment, we sell all of our avocados to Calavo. In our other agribusiness segment, our oranges, specialty citrus and other crops are sold through Sunkist and other packinghouses and our wine grapes are sold to wine producers.
Raw Materials
In our fresh lemons and lemon packing segments, paper is considered to be a material raw product for our business because most of our products are packed in cardboard cartons for shipment. Paper is readily available and we have numerous suppliers for such material.
Information about Geographic Areas
During fiscal year 2018, lemon sales were comprised of 81% domestic sales, 16% sales to domestic exporters and 3% international sales. Additionally, in fiscal year 2018, we had approximately $2.8 million of lemon and orange sales in Chile by PDA and San 
14

Pablo. During fiscal year 2017, lemon sales were comprised of 73% domestic sales, 23% sales to domestic exporters and 4% international sales. Additionally, in fiscal year 2017, we had approximately $1.1 million of lemon and orange sales in Chile by PDA. During fiscal year 2016, lemon sales were comprised of 77% domestic sales, 20% sales to domestic exporters and 3% international sales. The majority of our avocados, oranges and specialty citrus and other crops are sold to packinghouses and processors located in the United States. Most of our long-lived assets are located within the United States: however, we have 47% interest in Rosales, a citrus packing, marketing and sales business, a 90% interest in PDA, a lemon and orange orchard and 100% interest in San Pablo, a lemon and orange orchard, all of which are located near La Serena, Chile.
Seasonal Nature of Business
As with any agribusiness enterprise, our agribusiness division operations are predominantly seasonal in nature. The harvest and sale of our lemons, avocados, oranges and specialty citrus and other crops occurs in all quarters, but is generally more concentrated during our third quarter. With respect to our fresh lemons and lemon packing segment, our lemons are generally grown and marketed throughout the year. In terms of our avocado segment, our avocados are sold generally throughout the year with the peak months being February through September. In terms of our other agribusiness segment, our Navel oranges are primarily sold from January through April; our Valencia oranges are primarily sold from June through September; our specialty citrus is sold from November through June and our specialty crops, such as pistachios and wine grapes, are sold in September and/or October.
Competition
The agribusiness division crop markets, including those in which all of our agribusiness segments operate, are intensely competitive, but no single producer has any significant market power over any market segments, as is consistent with the production of most agricultural commodities. Generally, there are a large number of global producers that sell through joint marketing organizations and cooperatives. Fruit is also sold to independent packers, both public and private, who then sell to their own customer base. Customers are typically large retail chains, food service companies, industrial manufacturers and distributors who sell and deliver to smaller customers in local markets throughout the world. In the purest sense, our largest competitors in our agribusiness segments are other citrus and avocado producers in California, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Florida, a number of which are members of cooperatives such as Sunkist or have selling relationships with Calavo similar to that of Limoneira. We also compete with other fruits and vegetables for the share of consumer expenditures devoted to fresh fruit and vegetables: apples, pears, melons, pineapples and other tropical fruit. In our avocado segment specifically, avocado products compete in the supermarket with hummus products and other dips and salsas. U.S. producers of fruit and tree nuts generate approximately $25 billion in revenue from fruit and tree nuts annually, about 20% of which is exported. For our specific crops, the size of the U.S. market is approximately $375 million for lemons, approximately $350 million for avocados, and approximately $1.5 to $2.0 billion for oranges, both fresh and juice. Competition in the various markets in which our agribusiness division operates is affected by reliability of supply, product quality, brand recognition and perception, price and the ability to satisfy changing customer preferences through innovative product offerings.
The sale and leasing of residential, commercial and industrial real estate is very competitive, with competition coming from numerous and varied sources throughout California. Our greatest direct competition for each of our current real estate development properties in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties comes from other residential and commercial developments in nearby areas.
Intellectual Property
We have numerous trademarks and brands under which we market and sell our fruits, particularly lemons, domestically and internationally, many of which have been owned for decades. In our fresh lemons and lemon packing segment, the brands of Limoneira lemons which are of importance include: Santa®, Paula®, Bridal Veil®, Fountain®, Golden Bowl® and Level®; these examples of trademarks are owned by us and registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also acquired certain lemon brands with the acquisitions of Associated, including Kiva® and Kachina®, and Oxnard Lemon.
Employees
At October 31, 2018, we had 286 employees, 84 of which were salaried and 202 of which were hourly. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Research and Development
For our agribusiness division, our research and development programs concentrate on sustaining the productivity of our agricultural lands, product quality and value-added product development. Agricultural research is directed toward sustaining and improving product yields and product quality by examining and improving agricultural practices in all phases of production (such as the 
15

development of specifically adapted plant varieties, land preparation, fertilization, pest and disease control, post-harvest handling, packing and shipping procedures), and includes on-site technical services and the implementation and monitoring of recommended agricultural practices. Research efforts are also directed towards integrated pest management. We conduct agricultural research at field facilities throughout our growing areas. We also sponsor research related to environmental improvements and the protection of worker and community health. The aggregate amounts we spent on research and development in each of the last three years have not been material in any such year.
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Our agribusiness and real estate development divisions are subject to a broad range of evolving federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. For example, the growing, packing, storing and distributing of our products is extensively regulated by various federal and state agencies. The California State Department of Food and Agriculture oversees our packing and processing of lemons and conducts tests for fruit quality and packaging standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations which govern the use of pesticides and other potentially hazardous substances and the treatment, handling, storage and disposal of materials and waste and the remediation of contaminated properties. Advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and our operations are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
We seek to comply at all times with all such laws and regulations and to obtain any necessary permits and licenses, and we are not aware of any instances of material non-compliance. We believe our facilities and practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable governmental laws, regulations, permits and licenses. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations for necessary permits and licenses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or obtain any necessary permits and licenses could subject us to civil remedies including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions. These remedies can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
