ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

 ABOUT PFIZER 
Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development and manufacture of healthcare products. Our global portfolio includes medicines and vaccines, as well as many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products. We work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. We collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. Our revenues are derived from the sale of our products and, to a much lesser extent, from alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered or developed by other companies or us. The majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 2, 1942. 
We believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also from a reduction in other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. We continue to actively engage in dialogues about the value of our medicines and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. We continue to work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize patient access and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. We remain firmly committed to fulfilling our company’s purpose: Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives. By doing so, we expect to create value for the patients we serve and for our shareholders.
We are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, mergers and acquisitions. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities.
Our significant recent business development activities include:

• | On December 19, 2018, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with GSK under which we and GSK have agreed to combine our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture that will operate globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. The joint venture is expected to be a category leader in pain relief, respiratory, vitamin and mineral supplements, digestive health, skin health and therapeutic oral health and will be the largest global OTC consumer healthcare business. In exchange for contributing our Consumer Healthcare business, we will receive a 32% equity stake in the company and GSK will own the remaining 68%. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions including GSK shareholder approval and required regulatory approvals.


• | On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of Pfizer’s global infusion systems net assets, HIS, to ICU Medical for up to approximately $900 million, composed of cash and contingent cash consideration, ICU Medical common stock and seller financing. HIS, which was acquired as part of the Hospira acquisition in September 2015, includes intravenous pumps, solutions and devices.


• | On December 22, 2016, for $1,040 million we acquired the development and commercialization rights to AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, primarily outside the U.S., which includes the marketed products Zavicefta™ (ceftazidime-avibactam), Merrem™/Meronem™ (meropenem) and Zinforo™ (ceftaroline fosamil), and the clinical development assets aztreonam-avibactam and ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam.


• | On September 28, 2016, we acquired Medivation for approximately $14.3 billion in cash ($13.9 billion, net of cash acquired). Medivation is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small molecules for oncology.


• | On June 24, 2016, we acquired Anacor for approximately $4.9 billion in cash ($4.5 billion net of cash acquired), plus $698 million debt assumed. Anacor is a biopharmaceutical company focused on novel small-molecule therapeutics derived from its boron chemistry platform.

Acquisitions, Divestitures, Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Arrangements, Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements, Equity-Method Investments and Privately Held Investment and the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our Strategy and —Our Business Development Initiatives sections in our 2018 Financial Report.
Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., the principal authority regulating our operations is the FDA. The FDA regulates the safety and efficacy of the products we offer and our research, quality, manufacturing processes, product promotion, advertising and product labeling. Similar regulations exist in most other countries, and in many countries the government also regulates our prices. In the EU, the EMA conducts the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of our products, and employs a centralized procedure for approval of medicines for the EU and the European Economic Area countries. In China, the NMPA (formerly CFDA) is the primary regulatory authority for approving and supervising medicines. In Japan, the PMDA is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety. Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of the FDA or EMA) before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints section below.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS
From the second quarter of our 2016 fiscal year until the end of 2018, we managed our commercial operations through two distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH). The IH and EH operating segments were each led by a single manager. Each operating segment had responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products that generally have achieved proof-of-concept. Each business had a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets.
At the beginning of our fiscal year 2019, we began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of three businesses, each of which is led by a single manager—Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group (Biopharma), Upjohn and Consumer Healthcare. We designed this new global structure to take advantage of new growth opportunities driven by the evolving and unique dynamics of relevant markets.
Some additional information about each business follows:

• | Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group - a science-based Innovative Medicines business that includes our Innovative Health business units (except Consumer Healthcare) as well as a new Hospital business unit that commercializes our global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines. We also incorporated our biosimilar portfolio into our Oncology and Inflammation & Immunology therapeutic areas;


• | Upjohn - an off-patent branded and generic established medicines business headquartered in China that includes 20 of our off-patent solid oral dose legacy brands, including Lyrica, Lipitor, Norvasc, Viagra and Celebrex, as well as certain generic medicines; and


• | Consumer Healthcare - an over-the-counter medicines business, which we announced on December 19, 2018 will be contributed to, and combined with, GSK’s consumer healthcare business to form a new consumer healthcare joint venture.

Results for 2018 and prior periods in our 2018 Form 10-K are reported on the basis under which we managed our businesses in 2018 and do not reflect the 2019 reorganization. Beginning with our first-quarter 2019 financial results, our financial reporting will reflect the new organizational structure. 
For additional information regarding our new global structure, as well as our Organizing for Growth initiative, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook––Our Strategy––Organizing for Growth section in our 2018 Financial Report.
Some additional information about our business segments as of December 31, 2018 (prior to our new 2019 commercial organizational re-alignment) follows:

IH focused on developing and commercializing novel, value-creating medicines and vaccines that significantly improve patients’ lives, as well as products for consumer healthcare.Key therapeutic areas included internal medicine, vaccines, oncology, inflammation & immunology, rare disease and consumer healthcare. | EH included legacy brands that have lost or will soon lose market exclusivity in both developed and emerging markets, branded generics, generic sterile injectable products, biosimilars and select branded products including anti-infectives. EH also included an R&D organization, as well as our contract manufacturing business. Through February 2, 2017, EH also included HIS.
Leading brands included:- Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13- Xeljanz- Eliquis- Lyrica (U.S., Japan and certain other markets)- Enbrel (outside the U.S. and Canada)- Ibrance- Xtandi- Chantix/Champix- Several OTC consumer healthcare products (e.g., Centrum and Advil) | Leading brands included:- Lipitor- Norvasc- Lyrica (Europe, Russia, Turkey, Israel and Central Asia countries)- Celebrex- Viagra*- Inflectra/Remsima- Sulperazon- Several sterile injectable products

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COLLABORATION AND CO-PROMOTION AGREEMENTS
We are party to collaboration and/or co-promotion agreements relating to certain biopharmaceutical products, including, among others, Eliquis, Xtandi and Bavencio. Revenues from Eliquis (except in certain markets where we have direct sales), Xtandi and Bavencio are included in alliance revenues. 
Eliquis has been jointly developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with BMS. Pfizer funds between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on the study. Profits and losses are shared equally on a global basis, except in certain countries where Pfizer commercializes Eliquis and pays BMS compensation based on a percentage of net sales. We have full commercialization rights in certain smaller markets. BMS supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to end-customers in these markets. Eliquis is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant market; the agents in this class were developed as alternative treatment options to warfarin in appropriate patients.
Xtandi is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration with Astellas. The two companies share equally in the gross profits (losses) related to U.S. net sales of Xtandi. Subject to certain exceptions, Pfizer and Astellas also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the U.S. market. In addition, Pfizer and Astellas share certain development and other collaboration expenses, and Pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of international Xtandi net sales (recorded in Other (Income)/Deductions––Net). Xtandi is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells. 
Bavencio (avelumab) is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA. Both companies jointly fund the majority of development and commercialization costs, and split equally any profits generated from selling any products containing avelumab from this collaboration. Bavencio is currently approved in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in certain countries and in development as a potential treatment for multiple other types of cancer.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Innovation is critical to the success of our company, and drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs.
Our R&D Priorities and Strategy
Our R&D priorities include:

• | delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies and vaccines with the greatest medical and commercial potential;


• | advancing our capabilities that can position Pfizer for long-term leadership; and


• | creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and productivity.

To that end, our research and development primarily focuses on:

• | Inflammation and Immunology;


• | Internal Medicine;


• | Oncology;


• | Rare Diseases;


• | Vaccines; and


• | Biosimilars.

In January 2018, we announced our decision to end internal neuroscience discovery and early development efforts and re-allocate funding to other areas where we have stronger scientific leadership. The development of tanezumab and potential treatments for rare neuromuscular disorders is not impacted by this decision. In June 2018, we announced our plan to invest up to $600 million in biotechnology and other emerging growth companies through Pfizer Ventures, our venture investment vehicle. In September 2018, we and Bain Capital entered into a transaction to create a new biopharmaceutical company, Cerevel, to continue development of a portfolio of clinical and preclinical stage neuroscience assets primarily targeting disorders of the central nervous system, including Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia and addiction. For additional information on the transaction with Bain Capital, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 2B. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Arrangements, Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements, Equity-Method Investments and Privately Held Investment: Divestitures in our 2018 Financial Report.
While a significant portion of R&D is done internally, we continue to seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our product lines, by entering into collaboration, alliance and license agreements with other companies, as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity- or debt-based investments. These agreements enable us to co-develop, license or acquire promising compounds, technologies or capabilities. We also enter into agreements pursuant to which a third party agrees to fund a portion of the development costs of one or more of our pipeline products in exchange for rights to receive potential milestone payments, revenue sharing payments, profit sharing payments and/or royalties. Collaboration, alliance, license and funding agreements and equity- or debt-based investments allow us to share risk and cost and to access external scientific and technological expertise, and provide us the opportunity to advance our own products as well as the in-licensed or acquired products.
Our R&D Operations
We conduct R&D internally and also through contracts with third parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms. In 2018, we continued to strengthen our global R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&D to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the near term and over time.
Our R&D spending in 2018 was conducted through a number of matrix organizations:

• | Research Units within our WRD organization were generally responsible for research and early-stage development assets for our IH business (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-concept).


• | Our R&D organization within the EH business supported the large base of EH products and helped develop potential new sterile injectable drugs and therapeutic solutions, as well as biosimilars.


• | Our Global Product Development organization, a unified center for late-stage development for our innovative products that was generally responsible for the operational execution of clinical trials for both early-stage assets in the WRD portfolio as well as late-stage assets in the Innovative portfolio. For WRD assets, GPD worked in close collaboration with the Early Clinical Development group, which has expertise in various disciplines such as Biostatistics, Clinical Pharmacology and Digital Medicine.


• | Our science-based and other platform-services organizations, where a significant portion of our R&D spending occurred, provided technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects, and were organized into science-based functions (which were part of our WRD organization), such as Pharmaceutical Sciences, Medicine Design, Regulatory and Drug Safety, and non-science-based functions, such as Facilities, Business Technology and Finance.

At the beginning of 2019, we reorganized our R&D operations as part of our Organizing for Growth reorganization:

• | WRD is renamed Worldwide Research, Development and Medical (WRDM) as we have created a new Worldwide Medical & Safety organization that incorporates the former Chief Medical Office as well as the Worldwide Safety function;


• | The R&D organization within the EH business has been integrated into the WRDM, GPD and Upjohn organizations, including moving biosimilars into WRDM and GPD and realigning them with the relevant therapeutic areas (e.g., Oncology and Inflammation & Immunology);


• | The Regulatory function has been moved from the WRDM organization into the GPD organization; and


• | Late-stage portfolio spend has been moved from IH to GPD and from EH to GPD and Upjohn.

For discussion regarding these R&D matrix organizations and additional information on our R&D operations and expenses, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our Strategy—Description of Research and Development Operations and Costs and Expenses—Research and Development (R&D) Expenses sections in our 2018 Financial Report.
Our R&D Pipeline and Competition
The discovery and development of safe, effective new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research and development. The process from discovery to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years. 
As of January 29, 2019, we had the following number of projects in various stages of R&D:
Development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While these drug candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval, new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products. In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R&D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness, enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications for them.
Information concerning several of our drug candidates in development, as well as supplemental filings for existing products, is set forth in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Product Developments––Biopharmaceutical section in our 2018 Financial Report, which is incorporated by reference.
Our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to R&D. We also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates. The extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate without large R&D expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration. For additional information, see the Competition and Item 1A. Risk Factors—Competitive Products sections below.
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
We have significant operations outside the U.S. In 2018, operations in developed and emerging markets were managed through our two business segments: IH and EH. Emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership, and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets. Urbanization in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, is creating additional access opportunities for our medicines. 
We sell our products in over 125 countries. Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $28.3 billion accounted for 53% of our total revenues in 2018. By total revenues, China and Japan are our two largest national markets outside the U.S. For a geographic breakdown of revenues, see the table captioned Geographic Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 18. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information in our 2018 Financial Report, and the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Revenues—Overview and —Revenues by Segment and Geography sections in our 2018 Financial Report.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Our international operations are subject, in varying degrees, to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries, including, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange control regulations and expropriation and other restrictive government actions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—International Operations below. Our international businesses are also subject to government-imposed constraints, including laws and regulations on pricing, reimbursement, and access to our products. See Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints—Outside the United States below for a discussion of these matters.
Depending on the direction of change relative to the U.S. dollar, foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations. While we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us, we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments, depending upon market conditions. For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7F. Financial Instruments: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities in our 2018 Financial Report, as well as the Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results—Financial Risk Management section in our 2018 Financial Report. Those sections of our 2018 Financial Report are incorporated by reference.
MARKETING
In our global biopharmaceutical businesses, we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients. Through our marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers, such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists; MCOs that provide insurance coverage, such as hospitals, Integrated Delivery Systems, Pharmacy Benefit Managers and health plans; and employers and government agencies who hire MCOs to provide health benefits to their employees. We also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer advertising that seeks to communicate the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness, prevention and wellness, important public health issues, and our patient assistance programs.
Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies, and, in the case of our vaccines products in the U.S., we primarily sell directly to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies, and integrated delivery networks. We seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and PBM formularies, which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the PBMs. PBMs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formulary products, to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions. We may also work with payers to assist them with disease management, patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines.
In 2018, our top three biopharmaceutical wholesalers accounted for approximately 37% of our total revenues (and approximately 76% of our total U.S. revenues).

Major Biopharmaceutical Wholesalers and Other Customers
Our global Consumer Healthcare business uses its own sales and marketing organizations to promote its products, and occasionally uses distributors and agents, principally in smaller markets. The advertising and promotions for our Consumer Healthcare business are generally disseminated to consumers through television, print, digital and other media advertising, as well as through in-store promotion. Consumer Healthcare products are sold through a wide variety of channels, including distributors, pharmacies, retail chains and grocery and convenience stores. Our Consumer Healthcare business generates a significant portion of its sales from several large customers, the loss of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the Consumer Healthcare business.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Our products are sold around the world under brand-name, logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to Pfizer. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and, in other countries, for as long as it is registered. Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms.
We own or license a number of U.S. and foreign patents. These patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses, pharmaceutical formulations, product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing.
Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Further, patent term extension may be available in many major countries to compensate for a regulatory delay in approval of the product. For additional information, see Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints—Outside the United States—Intellectual Property below.
In various markets, a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided to certain therapeutics upon approval. The scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but, in general, the period of regulatory exclusivity will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the therapeutic.
In the aggregate, our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the U.S. and most other countries. Based on current product sales, and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by our competitors, the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole, together with the year in which the basic product patent expires (including, where applicable, the additional six-month pediatric exclusivity period and/or the granted patent term extension), are those for the medicines set forth in the table below. Unless otherwise indicated, the years set forth in the table below pertain to the basic product patent expiration for the respective products. Patent term extensions, supplementary protection certificates and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below, unless they have been granted by the issuing authority. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions, to methods of manufacturing, or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. However, in some cases, such patents may not protect our drug from generic or, as applicable, biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent.

A number of our current products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years. For additional information, including further discussion of our products experiencing, or expected to experience in 2019, patent expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S., Europe or Japan, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our Operating Environment—Industry-Specific Challenges—Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights section in our 2018 Financial Report and Item 1A. Risk Factors—Dependence on Key In-Line Products below. 
Companies have filed applications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patents; these include candidates that would compete with, among other products, Eliquis, Xeljanz and Xtandi. We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17A1. Contingencies and Certain Commitments—Legal Proceedings––Patent Litigation in our 2018 Financial Report. 
The expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in revenues for that product in a very short period of time. In some cases, however, we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets; patents on uses for products; patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients; patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms; or conversion of the active ingredient to OTC products.
Biologic Products
Our biologic products, including BeneFIX, ReFacto, Xyntha, Bavencio, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 and Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada), may face in the future, or already face, competition from biosimilars (also referred to as follow-on biologics). In the U.S., such biosimilars would reference our originator biologic products approved under the U.S. Public Health Service Act. Additionally, the FDA has approved a follow-on recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product, Genotropin, that was approved under the FFDCA.
Biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity or potency. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to biologic medicines. Abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and, since the passage of the ACA in 2010, a framework for such approval exists in the U.S. In Europe, the European Commission grants marketing authorizations for biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals. 
As part of our business strategy, we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing, as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths, to develop and commercialize biosimilar medicines. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Biologic Products below.
We may face litigation with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our biologic products. Likewise, as we develop, manufacture and seek to launch biosimilars, patents may be asserted against us.
International
One of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products. Under international and U.S. free trade agreements in recent years, we have seen some improvement in global protection of intellectual property rights. For additional information, see Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints—Outside the United States—Intellectual Property below.
COMPETITION
Our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. Though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups, demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses.
Our competitors include other worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic and biosimilar drug manufacturers and consumer healthcare manufacturers. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products.
This competition affects our core product business, which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements. Our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&D, as well as our business development transactions, both designed to result in a strong product pipeline. Our investment in research does not stop with drug approval; we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat, as well as potential new applications. We seek to protect the health and well-being of patients by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients, physicians, payers and global health authorities. We also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions, including coordinating support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers.
Operating conditions have become more challenging under mounting global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue to take measures to evaluate, adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs. We believe that we have taken an industry-leading role in evolving our approaches to U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising; interactions with, and payments to, healthcare professionals; and medical education grants. We also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers, as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions.
Our vaccines business may face competition from the introduction of alternative or next generation vaccines. For example, Prevnar 13 may face competition in the form of alternative 13-valent or additional valent next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to the expiration of its patents, which may adversely affect our future results.
Our generics and biosimilars businesses compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers. Globally, Pfizer sells generic versions of Pfizer’s, as well as certain competitors’, solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products, as well as biosimilars. We seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “first-to-

Pfizer Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

market” or early market position for our generic injectable drugs and biosimilars, as a “first-to-market” position provides customers a lower-cost alternative immediately when available and also may provide us with potentially higher levels of sales and profitability until other generic or biosimilar competitors enter the market. 
Our Consumer Healthcare business faces competition from OTC business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies, and retailers who carry their own private label brands. Our competitive position is affected by several factors, including the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors’ promotional resources; customer acceptance; product quality; our and our competitors’ introduction of new products, ingredients, claims, dosage forms, or other forms of innovation; and pricing, regulatory and legislative matters (such as product labeling, patient access and prescription to OTC switches).
Managed Care Organizations
The evolution of managed care in the U.S. has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 298 million people in the U.S. now have some form of health insurance coverage. Due to the expansion of health insurance coverage (see Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints—In the United States below), the marketing of prescription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in the U.S. continues to grow in importance.
The influence of MCOs has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the same time, those organizations have been consolidating into fewer, even larger entities. This consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate, as well as their importance to Pfizer.
The growth of MCOs has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues. One objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce healthcare expenditures. MCOs typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies (which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the MCOs), clinical protocols (requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine), volume purchasing, long-term contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs. In addition, by placing branded medicines on higher-tier status in their formularies (leading to higher patient co-pays) or non-preferred tier status, MCOs transfer a portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient, resulting in significant out-of-pocket expenses for the patient, especially for chronic treatments. This financial disincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the MCOs. MCOs also use additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing, “copay accumulator” programs and value-based pricing/contracting to improve their cost containment efforts. We are closely monitoring these newer approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them.
Due to their generally lower cost, generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of MCO formularies. The breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems. MCOs are currently evaluating the appropriate placement of biosimilars on their formularies.
Exclusion of a product from a formulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products. Unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or fewer side effects, are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies. However, lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. We have been generally, although not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO formularies. However, increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a non-preferred status. 
MCOs also emphasize primary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to manage costs. Hospitalization and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed. Since the use of certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization, professional therapy, or even surgery, such drugs can become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases. 
The ACA has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across MCOs and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs, which creates pressure on MCOs to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes. We anticipate continued Congressional interest in modifying provisions of the ACA, particularly given the recent ruling in Texas v. Azar to invalidate the law as unconstitutional, though we believe it is unlikely Congress will find bipartisan consensus to advance any significant changes to the ACA until the legal process unfolds. We are monitoring any such actions to see if any changes to the ACA will be enacted that would impact our business.
Generic Products
One of the biggest competitive challenges that our branded products face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product, especially a small molecule product, we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. Several competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product 

Pfizer Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

patents before their expiration. Generic competitors often operate without large R&D expenses, as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community. In addition, the FDA approval process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product. Generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less. In China, for example, we are expected to face strong competition by certain generic manufacturers in 2019, which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products. 
In addition, our patent-protected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity.
As noted above, MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute, for brand-name drugs, generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically and therapeutically equivalent to brand-name drugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution. Favoring generics may reduce sales of our branded products.
RAW MATERIALS
Raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these materials are available from multiple sources. In 2018, we experienced periodic shortages of select materials due to constrained capacity or operational challenges with the associated suppliers. Supplier management activities are ongoing to work to ensure the necessary supply to meet our requirements for these materials. No significant impact to our operations is anticipated in 2019. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which they do business. Certain laws and regulations that govern Pfizer’s business are discussed below.
General. Our business has been and will continue to be subject to numerous laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, including those governing the manufacture and marketing of our products, could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by various governmental bodies. For additional information on these proceedings and actions, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17A. Contingencies and Certain Commitments—Legal Proceedings in our 2018 Financial Report. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, warning letters and product recalls or seizures, delays in product approvals, as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from such proceedings and actions.
In the United States
Drug Regulation. In the U.S., biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and postmarket regulation by the FDA, including regulations that govern, among other things, the safety and efficacy of our medicines, clinical trials, advertising and promotion, manufacturing, labeling and record keeping. Our products are also subject to postmarket surveillance under the FFDCA and its implementing regulations with respect to drugs, as well as the Public Health Service Act and its implementing regulations with respect to biologics. Our Consumer Healthcare products are also subject to FDA regulation. 
Other U.S. federal agencies, including the DEA, also regulate certain of our products. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare products, including OTC drugs and dietary supplements. Many of our activities also are subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC. 
Biopharmaceutical companies seeking to market a product in the U.S. must first test the product to demonstrate that it is safe and effective for its intended use. If, after evaluation, the FDA determines the product is safe (i.e., its benefits outweigh its known risks) and effective, then the FDA will approve the product for marketing, issuing a NDA or BLA as appropriate. Companies seeking to market a generic prescription drug must scientifically demonstrate that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. The ANDA, or generic drug application, must show, among other things, that the generic drug is pharmaceutically equivalent to the brand, the manufacturer is capable of making the drug correctly, and the proposed label is the same as that of the innovator/brand drug’s label. 
Even after a drug or biologic is approved for marketing, it may still be subject to postmarketing commitments or postmarketing requirements. Postmarketing commitments are studies or clinical trials that the drug or biologic sponsor has agreed to conduct, but are not required by law and/or regulation. Postmarketing requirements include studies and clinical trials that sponsors are required to conduct, by law and/or regulation, as a condition of approval. Postmarketing studies or clinical trials can be required in order to assess a known risk or demonstrate clinical benefit for drugs or biologics approved pursuant to accelerated approval. If a company fails to meet its postmarketing requirements, the FDA may assess a civil monetary penalty, issue a warning letter or deem the drug or biologic misbranded. Once a drug or biologic is approved, any modifications to the product must be notified to the FDA and may also require a manufacturer to submit additional studies or conduct clinical trials. In addition, we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cGMPs, as well as advertising and promotion regulations. Failure to comply with the FFDCA may subject us to administrative and/or judicial sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls, seizures, delays in product approvals, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.
Biosimilar Regulation. The ACA created a framework for the approval of biosimilars (also known as follow-on biologics) following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic, with a potential six-month pediatric extension. Under the ACA, biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic. 
The FDA is responsible for implementation of the legislation and approval of new biosimilars. Through FDA approvals and the issuance of draft and final guidance, the FDA has addressed a number of issues related to the biosimilars approval pathway, such as the labeling expectations for biosimilars. Over the next several years, the FDA is expected to issue additional draft and final guidance documents impacting biosimilars, including updated draft or final guidance regarding the standards for demonstrating interchangeability with a U.S.-licensed reference product. In addition, in 2017, the Biosimilar User Fee Act was reauthorized for a five-year period, which should lead to a significant increase in the FDA’s biosimilar user fee revenues, thereby providing the FDA with additional resources to process biosimilar applications. For example, in the first year under the newly authorized fee structure, the FDA estimates its revenues from biosimilar user fees will increase by more than $10 million.
Sales and Marketing Laws and Regulations. The marketing practices of U.S. biopharmaceutical companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that are intended, among other things, to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and to protect the integrity of government healthcare programs. These laws include anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical company from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying anything of value to generate business, including purchasing or prescribing of a particular product. False claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for goods (including drugs or biologics) or services to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). The federal government and various states also have enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers, require disclosure to the federal or state government and the public of such interactions, and/or require the adoption of compliance standards or programs. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Individual states, acting through their attorneys general, have become active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations.
Pricing and Reimbursement. Pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products depends in part on government regulation. Pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the “federal ceiling price” drug pricing program, the 340B drug pricing program and the Medicare Part D Program. Pfizer must also report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose Pfizer to penalties. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Revenues—Overview section in our 2018 Financial Report and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1G. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable in our 2018 Financial Report, which are incorporated by reference.
Government and private third-party payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products. For example, the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical products under Medicaid. Restrictions exist for some Pfizer products under certain state Medicaid programs. As another example, access to our products under the Medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans with which state Medicaid agencies contract to provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries. Given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises, a growing number of states are considering a variety of cost-control strategies, including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers, who are the primary purchasers of our pharmaceutical products in the U.S., will increase pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us.
Efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation, could adversely affect our business if implemented. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. At the federal level, for example, in May 2018, President Trump released his Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs (Blueprint). Certain proposals in the Blueprint, and related drug pricing measures proposed since the Blueprint, could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry. As another example, in October 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services solicited public comments on potential changes to payment for certain Medicare Part B drugs, including reducing the Medicare payment amount for selected Medicare Part B drugs to more closely align with international drug prices. In addition, in January 2019, the White House Office of Management and Budget released the long awaited proposed rule submitted by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to remove safe harbor protections for drug rebates paid to insurance plans and PBMs for Medicare Part D and Managed Medicaid and to create new safe harbors. Among other changes, the proposed rule would explicitly exclude the reductions in price offered by drug manufacturers to PBMs in Medicare Part D and Managed Medicaid plans from protection under the “discount” safe harbor. It would also create a new safe harbor designed specifically for price reductions in pharmaceutical products, but only those that are fully reflected in the price to the patient at the pharmacy counter. Additionally, a new safe harbor was proposed to protect administrative fees paid to PBMs, which must be at fair market value, a fixed fee and not based upon a percentage of volume or list price. Manufacturers could continue to negotiate price reductions with PBMs and Medicare Part D and Managed Medicaid plans if their reductions meet that criterion. The proposed rule represents a large step toward significantly altering the current rebate model in place with MCOs. We are in the process of evaluating the implications of the proposed rule on our operations and processes, as well as the infrastructure that will be required in order to implement the rule once it is finalized. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. Certain state legislation has been subject to legal challenges. Adoption of new legislation regulating drug pricing at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. 
We believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We will continue to work with lawmakers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes, lower costs to the healthcare system, and ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system.
Healthcare Reform. There have been significant efforts at the federal and state levels to reform the healthcare system by enhancing access to healthcare, improving the delivery of healthcare and further rationalizing payment for healthcare. For example, we face uncertainties due to federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. For example, tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017 eliminates the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019 (the so-called “individual mandate”). We anticipate continued Congressional interest in modifying provisions of the ACA, particularly given the recent ruling in Texas v. Azar to invalidate the law as unconstitutional. At this time, the law remains in effect pending appeals of the decision. Given the outcomes of the 2018 U.S. midterm elections with Democrats taking over the U.S. House of Representatives and Republicans growing their majority in the U.S. Senate, we believe it is unlikely Congress will find bipartisan consensus to advance any significant changes to the ACA until the legal process unfolds. The revenues generated for Pfizer by the health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion under the ACA are not material, so the impact of the change in law and similar recent administration actions is expected to be limited. Any future replacement, modification or repeal of the ACA may adversely affect our business and financial results, particularly if the legislation reduces incentives for employer-sponsored insurance coverage. As another example, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which increased the discount we pay in the Medicare Part D “coverage gap” from 50% to 70%, will modestly increase our future Medicare Part D rebates. Any future healthcare reform efforts may adversely affect our business and financial results.
Anti-Corruption. The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
Outside the United States
We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. 
New Drug Approvals. In the EU, the approval of new drugs may be achieved using the Mutual Recognition Procedure, the Decentralized Procedure or the EU Centralized Procedure. These procedures apply in the EU member states, plus the European Economic Area countries, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The Centralized Procedure, managed by the EMA, results in one single authorization for the whole EU, which provides the most rapid and efficient means of gaining approval across the EU and is the one most commonly used for new products.
In China, the regulatory system historically presented numerous challenges for the pharmaceutical industry, as its requirements for drug development and registration were often inconsistent with U.S. or other international standards. In recent years, however, China has introduced reforms and draft reforms, which are discussed in more detail below, that attempt to address these challenges. 2018 was another active year in this respect, with a number of reforms coming into effect, and more proposals and drafts being issued for consultation. Also, in 2018, a significant government restructuring resulted in the creation of the National Medical Product Administration (NMPA), replacing the former CFDA.
In Japan, the PMDA is the point of entry for businesses looking to sell drugs in the country. The PMDA, which is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, postmarketing reviews and pharmaceuticals safety, must approve an application before a new drug product may be marketed in Japan. The PMDA also offers consultations on clinical trials of new drugs and provides advice on product classifications and approvals.
Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of the FDA or the EMA) before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. Many authorities also require local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval. 
Pharmacovigilance. In the EU, detailed legislation and guidance on pharmacovigilance has increased and strengthened in recent years. The EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee has the responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the EU authorities. EU regulators may require pharmaceutical companies to conduct post-authorization safety and efficacy studies at the time of approval, or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments. There are also additional extensive requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products. Outside developed markets such as the EU and Japan, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive, but there is a trend toward increasing regulation.
Pricing and Reimbursement. In Europe, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and some other international markets, governments provide healthcare at low-to-zero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power as large single payers to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global economic pressures. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures for our pharmaceutical products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access and international reference pricing (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries). This international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying health outcomes and some third-party trade in our products between countries.
In particular, international reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation. Price variations, exacerbated by international reference pricing systems, also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations. The downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies and measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some European countries.
In addition, several important multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations (UN), including the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations (e.g., 2016 UN High Level Panel Report on Access to Medicines). Late in 2018, two new reports critical of the pharmaceutical industry’s pricing practices were published: OECD’s Pharmaceutical Innovation and Access to Medicines and WHO’s Pricing of Cancer Medicines and its Impacts. These reports and upcoming public forums focused on their recommendations will continue to exert additional pricing pressures.
In China, pricing pressures have increased in recent years. Top Chinese government officials have consistently emphasized the importance of improved health outcomes, the need for healthcare reform and decreased drug prices as a key indicator of progress towards reform. Even though the government provides basic health insurance for the vast majority of Chinese citizens, the insurance is not adequate to cover innovative medicines. Alternative funding sources for innovative medicines remain suboptimal, as private health insurance growth is restrained by issues with access to healthcare data, potential corruption concerns and control over providers.
In 2017 and 2018, Chinese authorities entered into special negotiations with China’s National Medical Security Bureau to add approximately 60 high-value drugs (mainly oncology medicines) to the National Reimbursement Drug List. Prices for drugs were reduced dramatically through these negotiations, some by as much as 70 percent. While these negotiations included a path to access for companies, market access is not strictly assured. In addition, significant questions about the processes and negotiations for provincial tendering remain. In addition, multi-layered negotiations are required across provincial, municipal and hospital levels, and the linkage of price negotiations to reimbursement is inconsistent. In the off-patent space, in 2013, China began to implement a quality consistency (QCE) process in order to improve the quality of domestically-manufactured generic drugs, primarily by requiring such drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug (typically the originator drug). In 2018, numerous local generics were officially deemed bioequivalent under the QCE. A pilot project for centralized procurement of 31 categories of drugs covering 11 major Chinese cities now drives patients to generics that have passed the QCE, which has resulted in dramatic price cuts for off-patent drugs.
In Japan, the access environment for innovative medicines continued to deteriorate in 2018 with tighter restrictions around the criteria to gain a price maintenance premium and a push by the Japanese government to adopt healthcare technology assessments based on rigid cost-effectiveness criteria for re-pricing of reimbursed medicines. Additionally, the Japanese government has officially requested the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare to look into using cost-effectiveness analyses to make reimbursement decisions at the launch of a drug.
EU Regulatory Changes. The EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation in May 2014, which is expected to come into effect sometime in late 2019. This regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the governance of clinical trials in the EU and will require increased public posting of clinical trial results.
Brexit. In June 2016, the U.K. electorate voted in a referendum to leave the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. In March 2017, the U.K. government formally notified the European Council of its intention to leave the EU after it triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to begin the two-year negotiation process establishing the terms of the exit and outlining the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU. Formal negotiations officially started in June 2017. This process continues to be highly complex and the end result of these negotiations may pose certain implications to our research, commercial and general business operations in the U.K. and the EU, including the approval and supply of our products. The EMA will be relocating from London, U.K. to Amsterdam, Netherlands by the scheduled date of Brexit at the end of March 2019. At present, it is still unclear whether and to what extent the U.K. will remain within or aligned to the EU system of medicines regulation, and/or what separate requirements will be imposed in the U.K. after it leaves the EU. However, both the U.K. and the EU have issued detailed guidance for the industry on how medicines, medical devices and clinical trials will be separately regulated in their respective territories in the event of a ‘hard Brexit’, meaning an outcome where no negotiated settlement is reached. For additional information on Brexit, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our Operating Environment—The Global Economic Environment in our 2018 Financial Report.
China Regulatory Changes. In an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce backlogs for existing applications for drug approval, the NMPA has unveiled numerous reform initiatives for China’s drug approval system, and engaged in significant efforts to build its capabilities. The NMPA now divides drugs into new drugs and generics, with the definition for new drugs changed from “China New” to “Global New.” This means that drugs previously approved in other markets (such as the U.S. or Europe) will not be considered new drugs under China’s regulatory regime. This change in definition creates more opportunities for China’s domestic drug manufacturers than for multinational firms, because multinational firms have historically had significant competitive advantage in successfully achieving regulatory approvals for drugs first approved outside of China. Revisions in 2017 made clear, however, that regulatory approval from the FDA or the EMA would no longer be required for approval of imported drugs, though a notable exception persists for imported vaccines, which still require prior approval from a relevant regulatory agency. The “marketing authorization holder” system, which will allow for more flexibility in contract manufacturing arrangements and asset transfers, is now being piloted in ten Chinese provinces, but not yet for imported drugs.
While challenges remain, a number of other policy changes are streamlining and accelerating approvals of domestic and imported drugs in China. These reforms, along with China’s June 2018 entry into the Management Committee of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, are expected to pave the way for integration of Chinese regulations with global practices. These changes include introducing an umbrella clinical trial authorization for all three phases of registration studies (instead of the original phase-by-phase approvals), a filing/recordation system for bioequivalence studies on generics (instead of the original review and approval system), admitting more categories of drugs as innovative drugs eligible for the fast track/“green channel” approval pathway and ongoing implementation of previously announced regulatory reforms. In 2018, the review timeline for clinical trial authorizations was shortened to 60 working days due to the introduction of a clinical trial notification system, and China’s Fast Track Policy was finalized, for a specific group of products selected by the Center for Drug Evaluation, part of the NMPA.
In addition, China’s Human Genetic Resources Administrative Office strictly scrutinizes clinical trials involving the collection, storage, export and use of human genetic resources and relevant deriving data from the Chinese population, adding an extra layer of review in addition to that of the NMPA.
Healthcare Provider Transparency and Disclosures. A number of countries have implemented laws requiring (or their industry associations have recommended) disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers. For example, the EFPIA’s disclosure code requires all members, including Pfizer, to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations. 
Intellectual Property. The World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS) required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005, with an extension until 2033 for least-developed countries. While we still face patent grant, enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world, some countries have made improvements. We include stronger patent protection among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries. 
While the global intellectual property environment has generally improved following WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection. In emerging market countries in particular, governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool for reducing the price of imported medicines, as well as to protect their local pharmaceutical industries. Considerable political and economic pressure exists to weaken current intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection, which has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions (e.g., new medical treatment methods), revocation of patents, issuance (and threat of issuance) of compulsory licenses, weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection. Our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers, as well as on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries. In developed countries as well, including the EU, we are facing an increasingly challenging intellectual property environment.
Canada’s intellectual property regime for drugs provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity (currently eight years plus six-month pediatric extension), but it lacks the predictability and stability that otherwise comparable countries provide. Through intense negotiations as part of the Canada/EU Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement (CETA), Canadian authorities have amended the Patent Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations to provide the innovator a right of appeal, and Canada now provides sui generis protection for patent term extensions of up to two years for basic patents. Furthermore, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), if ratified and implemented, would establish 10 years of data protection for biologics and patent term adjustment for unreasonable or unnecessary delays in the grant of patents.
In China, the intellectual property environment has improved, although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern. The government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with World Trade Organization provisions, and several companies, including Pfizer, have established R&D centers in China due to increased confidence in China’s intellectual property environment. Despite this, China remained on the U.S. Trade Representative’s Priority Watch List for 2018. Further, the standards for patentability in China remain more restrictive than in other major markets, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. Also, while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years, enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent. For example, the absence of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions, impractical evidentiary burdens, and heightened sufficiency standards have been used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage.
In Brazil and other Latin American countries, the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents (e.g., National Health Surveillance Agency in Brazil), restrictive patentability rules, ambiguity regarding the term of certain patents and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products through patents. The lack of regulatory data protection and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions, such as new medical uses of drug products, may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical products. Additionally, an increased threat of issuance of compulsory licenses for biopharmaceutical products exists, which adds to business uncertainty.
In India, we have seen some progress in terms of expediting patent approval processes to reduce pendency rates and implementing training programs to enhance enforcement. Despite these positive steps, gaps remain in terms of addressing longstanding intellectual property concerns. For example, policies favoring compulsory licensing of patents, the tendency of the Indian Patent Office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in opposition proceedings (both pre- and post-grant), and restrictive standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to safeguard many of our inventions and our investments in innovation. These policies heighten the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovative pharmaceutical products, especially in areas perceived as being important to the public health of the population. Challenges against Pfizer patents in India are ongoing.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Most of our operations are affected by national, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17A3. Contingencies and Certain Commitments—Legal Proceedings––Commercial and Other Matters in our 2018 Financial Report. As a result, we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2018 for environmental compliance purposes and for the clean-up of certain past industrial activity as follows:

• | environment-related capital expenditures— $33 million; and


• | other environment-related expenses— $162 million.

While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position.
Climate change presents risks to our operations, including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs, and the potential for more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers. For example, in 2017, our manufacturing and commercial operations in Puerto Rico were impacted by hurricanes. For additional information, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our Business—Impact of Hurricanes in Puerto Rico section of the 2018 Financial Report. We cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future; however, we have a program for reviewing our vulnerability to potential weather-related risks and we update our assessments periodically. To date, we have concluded that, because of our facility locations, our existing distribution networks and our controls, we do not anticipate that these risks will have a material impact on Pfizer in the near term.
