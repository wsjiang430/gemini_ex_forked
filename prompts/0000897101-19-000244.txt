Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

Introduction
 
Electro-Sensors, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “ESI”) manufactures and sells industrial production monitoring and process control systems.
 
In addition, we may periodically make strategic investments in other businesses and companies, including investments that we believe would facilitate the development of technology complementary to our existing products or investments that we believe present good opportunities for the Company and its shareholders.  Our primary focus is to remain an operating company and we do not intend to become an investment company.
 
ESI was incorporated in Minnesota in July 1968. Our executive offices are located at 6111 Blue Circle Drive, Minnetonka, Minnesota, 55343-9108. Our telephone number is (952) 930-0100.
 
Products
 
We manufacture and sell a variety of monitoring systems that measure machine production and operation rates, as well as systems that regulate the speed of related machines in production processes.
 
Our goal is to develop meaningful annual updates to our standard products.
 
We have a sales agreement with Motrona GmbH, a German control and interface devices manufacturer, under which we have the right to distribute Motrona products in the United States. These products interface with our products on various applications for motion monitoring.
 
  Speed Monitoring Systems

Our speed monitoring systems compare revolutions per minute or speed against acceptable rates as determined by our customers. These systems vary in complexity, from simple systems that detect slow-downs or stoppages, to more sophisticated systems that warn of deviations from precise tolerances and that permit various subsidiary operations to be determined through monitoring the shaft speed.
 
Our speed monitoring systems also include a line of products that measure production counts or rates, such as parts, gallons per minute, or board feet. These speed monitoring systems also include alarm systems, tachometers, and other devices that translate impulses from the sensors into alarm signals, computer inputs, or digital displays that are usable by the customer.
 
We have several products used in drive control systems that regulate the speed of motors on related machines in a production sequence to ensure that the performances of various operations are coordinated. The products consist of a line of digital control products for motors that require a complete closed loop PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) control. The closed loop controllers coordinate production speed among process motors and reduce waste.
 
  Temperature Application Products
 
Our main temperature applications include bearing, gear box, and motor temperature monitoring sensors.  These sensors alert an operator when the temperature exceeds or is less than a specified temperature.

  Position Application Products
 
We also offer production monitoring devices that include a belt alignment and slide gate position monitor.  The belt alignment monitor is used to determine if a belt is tracking correctly.  The slide gate position monitor is used in plant operations to provide feedback of the position of a slide gate.  It is also used to provide feedback of the position of a valve or control arm.
  Vibration Monitoring Products 
 
A vibration monitor alerts an operator when the vibration of a machine in a production system exceeds or is less than a specified level.

  Tilt Switches
 
A tilt switch is designed to alert the operator when a storage bin or production system reaches a certain capacity. 
 
  Hazard Monitoring Systems 
 
Electro-Sentry We offer the Electro-Sentry 1 and Electro-Sentry 16 hazard monitoring systems, which integrate our sensors for monitoring temperature, belt misalignment, and shaft speed with programmable control logic and LED display interface to create a complete system for hazard monitoring. These systems enable our customers to locate which part of their material handling system is operating incorrectly, typically in less than ten seconds, by using visual indication on the LED displays. 
 
HazardPROTM We market our wireless hazard technology monitoring system under the HazardPRO product name. This integrated hazard monitoring system captures and displays key information in an intuitive format allowing the user to quickly and comprehensively understand the status and history of its processes.  The simple but powerful interface gives the user insight into its operations as it strives to maximize safety and facility runtime, while minimizing costs associated with unscheduled maintenance and unplanned downtime. We offer Class II Division I, the industry standard for dust environments, intrinsically safe nodes and sensors that are certified for use in hazardous environments.
 
The HazardPRO software includes a large site system manager link used to efficiently collect data from sensors placed across a widely dispersed area that has been deployed in sites covering greater than 50 acres.  We have also added a complete antenna pair mounting system to the product line for easy and accurate customer installation.
 
We expect to continue to expend resources to develop new products and to market new and existing products for use in a wide variety of monitoring applications.
 
Our corporate website, www.electro-sensors.com, provides significant product application information for our existing and prospective customers and our sales partners. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference herein and is not a part of this Form 10-K.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
We sell our products primarily through both our internal sales team and a number of manufacturer’s representatives and distributors located throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, Peru, United Kingdom, Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore. Sales to customers outside the United States represented approximately 11% of our 2018 sales. We sell our products under the Electro-Sensors, Inc. brand as a range of products from simple sensors to complex integrated monitoring systems.  Our customers are businesses in a wide variety of industries, including grain/feed/milling, bulk materials, manufacturing, food products, ethanol, power generation, and other processing industries.

We continue to explore new industries and applications within the current industries we serve to expand sales and may also consider acquiring compatible businesses or product lines as part of our growth strategy.  In addition, we may make investments that we believe present good opportunities for the Company and its shareholders.
 
We believe that a wide variety of organizations could achieve significant savings in both time and materials by adding production monitoring and drive control technology to existing processes to coordinate the operation of related machines. We sell our products into both the “retro-fit” market and into new manufacturing or processing systems.
 
We advertise in national industrial periodicals that cover a range of industrial products and attend several local, national and international industry tradeshows throughout the year. We also use our corporate website and other related industry websites for advertising and marketing purposes.
 
Competition

We face substantial competition in the sale of our production monitoring systems from a broad range of industrial and commercial businesses. Many of these competitors are well established and have greater sales volume. Among our larger competitors are Danaher Controls, Red Lion Controls, 4B Elevator Components Ltd., and Durant Corporation. We believe our competitive advantages include our products superior design and quality, the fact that we sell our products as ready-to-install units, and the fact that our products can be used in a wide range of applications. Our major disadvantages include the fact that our major competitors are larger, have a broader range of sensing instruments, and have larger sales forces and established names.
Suppliers
 
We purchase parts and materials for our systems from various manufacturers and distributors. In some instances, these materials are manufactured in accordance with our proprietary designs. Multiple sources of these parts and materials are generally available, and we do not depend on any single source for these supplies and materials. We have not experienced any significant problem of short supply or delays from our suppliers.
Customers
 
We do not depend upon a single or a few customers for a material (10% or more) portion of our sales.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
 
The Company relies on a combination of patent, trademark, and trade secret laws to establish proprietary right in its products.
 
We have registered the name “Electro-Sensors” as a trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), Reg. No. 1,142,310. We believe this trademark has been and will continue to be useful in developing and protecting market recognition for our products. We established the HazardPRO trademark in the first quarter of 2014 and intend to register this trademark.
 
We hold six patents relating to our production monitoring systems. We believe strongly in protecting our intellectual property and have a long history of obtaining patents, when available, in connection with our research and product development programs. We also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary know-how.
 
We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary intellectual property, including know-how, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, and other parties. We cannot ensure, however, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors.

Seasonality
 
Generally, the Company experiences seasonality in the sale of its products with the second and third calendar quarters historically the strongest.
 
Business Development Activities
 
We continue to seek growth opportunities, both internally through our existing portfolio of products, technologies and markets, as well as externally through technology partnerships or related-product acquisitions.  In addition, we may make investments that we believe present good opportunities for the Company and its shareholders.
Governmental Approvals
 
Although we are not required to obtain governmental approval of our products, we choose to obtain certain third party certifications to meet our customers’ needs. These certifications may expand our market opportunities in certain industries.
Effect of Governmental Regulations
 
We do not believe that any existing or proposed governmental regulations will have a material effect on our business.
 
Research and Development 
 
We invest in research and development programs to develop new products and to integrate state-of-the-art technology into our existing products. We undertake development projects based upon the identified specific needs of the markets we serve.  Our "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section describes the nature and amount of our Research and Development expenditures.
 
Our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop new products in our varying segments. Difficulties or delays in our ability to develop, produce, test and market new products could have a material adverse effect on future sales growth.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws has only a nominal effect on current or anticipated capital expenditures and has had no material effect on earnings or on our competitive position.
Employees 
 
As of March 19, 2019, we had 33 employees, all of whom are full-time. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are members of unions.
 
Our ability to maintain a competitive position and to continue to develop and market new products depends, in part, on our ability to retain key employees and qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain our key employees, or recruit and train others, our product development, marketing and sales could be adversely affected.
 
Fluctuations in Operating Results.
 
We have experienced fluctuations in our past operating results, and expect to experience fluctuations in the future.  These fluctuations may affect the market price of our common stock. Sales can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: product competition and acceptance, timing of customer orders, cancellation of orders, the mix of products sold, downturns in the markets we serve and economic disruptions. Because fluctuations may occur, we caution investors that results of our operations for recent periods may not accurately predict how we will perform in the future. We cannot ensure that we will achieve revenue or earnings growth.

Expending Funds for Changes in Industry Standards, Customer Preferences or Technology.
 
Our business depends on periodically introducing new and enhanced products and solutions for customer needs. Our product development efforts require us to commit financial resources, personnel and time, usually in advance of significant market demand for these products. In order to compete, we must anticipate both future demand and the technology available to meet that demand. We cannot ensure that our research and development efforts will lead to new products or product innovations that can be made available to or will be accepted by the market.
