ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Merger of Signal Genetics, Inc. and Miragen Therapeutics, Inc.
On February 13, 2017, we, then known as Signal Genetics, Inc., or Signal, completed our merger with Miragen Therapeutics, Inc., a then privately-held Delaware corporation, or Private Miragen. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or the Merger Agreement, by and among Signal, Private Miragen, and Signal Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Signal, or Merger Sub, Merger Sub merged with and into Private Miragen, with Private Miragen surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Signal, or the Merger. Immediately, following the Merger, Private Miragen merged with and into us, with us as the surviving corporation, or the Short-Form Merger, and, together with the Merger, the Mergers. In connection with the Short-Form Merger, we changed our corporate name to “Miragen Therapeutics, Inc.” Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, or our common stock, began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “MGEN” on February 14, 2017. 
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing proprietary RNA-targeted therapies with a specific focus on microRNAs and their role in certain diseases where there is a high unmet medical need. microRNAs are short RNA molecules, or oligonucleotides, that regulate gene expression and play vital roles in influencing the pathways responsible for many disease processes. We have three product candidates, cobomarsen, remlarsen and MRG-110, in clinical development. We believe each has the potential to treat multiple indications. We are independently developing cobomarsen and remlarsen and are developing MRG-110 in collaboration with Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de Recherches Servier, or, collectively, Servier.
Cobomarsen is an inhibitor of miR-155, which is a microRNA that is found at abnormally high levels in malignant cells of several blood cancers. Remlarsen is a replacement for miR-29, a microRNA that is found at abnormally low levels in a number of pathological fibrotic conditions. MRG-110 is an inhibitor of miR-92, a microRNA expressed in endothelial cells. MRG-110 is being developed for the treatment of heart failure, as well as surgical incisions in high risk populations, severe lacerations, and severe burns. We retain all commercial rights to MRG-110 in the United States and Japan, and Servier has commercial rights to MRG-110 for cardiovascular indications in the rest of the world.
In addition to our clinical-stage programs, we continue to develop a pipeline of preclinical product candidates. The goal of our translational medicine strategy is to progress rapidly to first-in-human trials once we have adequately established the pharmacokinetics (the movement of a drug into, through, and out of the body), pharmacodynamics (the effect and mechanism of action of a drug), safety, and manufacturability of the product candidate in preclinical studies.
We believe our experience in microRNA biology and chemistry, drug discovery, bioinformatics, translational medicine, and drug development allows us to identify and develop mircroRNA-targeted drugs that are designed to regulate gene pathways to return diseased tissues to a healthy state. We believe that our drug discovery and development strategy will enable us to progress our product candidates from preclinical discovery to confirmation of mechanism of action in humans quickly and efficiently. The elements of this strategy include identification of biomarkers that may predict clinical benefit and monitoring outcomes in early-stage clinical trials to help guide later clinical development.

Our Strategy

We seek to use our expertise and understanding of microRNA biology, oligonucleotide chemistry, product development, and manufacturing to create novel products that have the potential to transform the treatment of patients with diseases. The key components of our strategy are as follows:

• | Continue to develop cobomarsen for blood cancers. Cobomarsen is currently being developed in two clinical trials for multiple indications. Our global Phase 2 clinical trial, called SOLAR, for cobomarsen in patients with mycosis fungoides, or MF, the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL, is in the startup phase with initial dosing expected during early 2019. The dosage and administration method of cobomarsen in SOLAR, 300 mg

6

intravenous infusion, or IV infusion, demonstrated an objective response in patients that lasted for at least four months (ORR4, the primary outcome in our Phase 2 clinical trial) in 50% of a cohort of eight patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial. In addition to CTCL, we are also developing cobomarsen in three expansion indications where the disease process appears to correlate with an increase in miR-155 levels, the target of cobomarsen. These additional indications are adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, or ATLL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL.

• | Continue to develop remlarsen and other miR-29 replacements for pathological fibrosis. In 2018, we initiated a double-blind, randomized Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate remlarsen in subjects with a predisposition for keloid formation. In 2017, we announced results from the double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating remlarsen in induced cutaneous fibrosis. In the trial, we observed mechanistic proof-of-concept for remlarsen, based on a statistically-significant reduction in scar tissue deposition, with no adverse effects on incisional wound healing when remlarsen was given. Additional indications to be studied for a miR-29 mimic could include fibrotic diseases of the lung and eye.


• | Utilize rare disease development pathways at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and comparable programs at foreign regulatory agencies to accelerate progression to late-stage development and early approval. For our wholly-owned programs, we intend to focus on rare and genetic diseases where RNA modulation may produce clinical benefit, so that we can potentially take advantage of regulatory programs intended to expedite drug development. In 2017, the FDA granted orphan-drug designation to cobomarsen for the treatment of MF and the European Commission granted orphan medicinal product designation to cobomarsen for the treatment of CTCL. We plan to apply for orphan drug designation, fast track, breakthrough therapy designation, and/or priority review when available to potentially reduce clinical trial expense and decrease time to commercialization.


• | Collaborate with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to develop additional product candidates. We intend to seek out collaborations for the development of compounds in our pipeline for certain disease areas where the costs would exceed our resources or in other areas where we believe that leveraging a partner’s expertise or resources will allow us to accelerate development timelines. For example, we have a strategic collaboration with Servier to develop product candidates for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.


• | Use our in-house research and translational expertise to further develop our product candidate pipeline. Our in-house research team investigates microRNAs that have been identified as potential therapeutic targets through internal efforts and academic collaborations. We then seek to establish evidence that modulation of the microRNAs’ activity may provide benefit in pathological conditions or diseases in which the microRNA is implicated. We believe that this internal research and expertise could provide a foundation to develop product candidates for the treatment of a variety of diseases.


• | Selectively build focused commercial capabilities and establish commercial collaborations to maximize the value of our product candidate pipeline. To date, we have retained all U.S. and Japanese rights to our product candidates in the strategic collaboration with Servier and global rights in all of our other programs. While we have not yet defined our sales, marketing, or product distribution strategy for cobomarsen, remlarsen, MRG-110, or any of our other product candidates, if approved, our commercial strategy may include the use of strategic alliances, distributors, a contract sales force, or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force to maximize the value of our pipeline.

Our Product Candidates

Cobomarsen

Cobomarsen is an inhibitor of miR-155. Data reported in the scientific literature identifies miR-155 as a cancer-causing microRNA, or oncomiR. There are several types of cancer in which high levels of miR-155 have been observed, including, among others, CTCL, certain virally-induced lymphomas such as ATLL caused by the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, or HTLV-1, subsets of DLBCL, CLL, and other types of cancer. Based on this literature, miR-155 is implicated in the expression of a number of validated cancer-related disease targets, including Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, or BTK, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells, or NF-κB. In certain B-cell lymphomas, improvement of clinical outcomes has been associated with normalization of miR-155 levels, while poor prognosis, resistance to treatment, and recurrence of the disease are associated with elevated levels of miR-155. In addition to playing a role in B-cell malignancies, miR-155 is elevated in another group of malignant white blood cells, called T-cells, found in skin lesions of patients with MF. We screened a library of locked nucleic acid, or LNA, modified oligonucleotides and identified cobomarsen as having what we believed was the best 
7

potential efficacy and drug-like properties, including improved pharmacodynamics in human T-cell and B-cell lymphoma cell lines. We retain worldwide rights for cobomarsen.

Mycosis Fungoides

MF is a slow growing form of cancer that has been associated with elevated miR-155. This disease is the most common form of a type of blood cancer known as CTCL, which occurs when certain types of T-cells become cancerous. These malignant T-cells then form specific types of skin lesions. Although the skin is involved, the skin cells themselves are not cancerous. According to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, MF usually occurs in adults over age 50, although the disease may occur at any age.

We believe the total population of patients with CTCL in the United States and Canada is approximately 30,000. The Lymphoma Research Foundation estimated the prevalence of MF to be 16,000-20,000 cases in the United States, with 3,000 new diagnoses of MF each year. According to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, or LLS, in a 2014 publication, approximately 70% to 80% of patients are diagnosed with early-stage MF that impacts only the skin. In these patients, the disease typically has a slow progression, but is accompanied by serious quality of life detriments such as severe itchiness, pain, and disfiguration. The five-year survival rate for newly diagnosed patients with CTCL is approximately 90%. As CTCL progresses, the cancer may involve the lymph nodes, blood, and internal organs. The five-year survival rate in later stage patients with CTCL (stages IIB, III, IV) is approximately 20-60% depending on the stage.

There are currently no curative therapies for CTCL, and concurrent and consecutive treatments, many with significant adverse effects, tend to be given until loss of response. We believe there is a need for new and improved therapies in CTCL to treat the disease and reduce symptoms, such as itchiness and painful skin lesions, and to prolong survival in patients with aggressive disease.

There is no universally accepted standard of care, or SOC, for treatment of MF. Treatment is dependent on stage of disease and responsiveness to previous therapy and is divided into skin-directed therapy and systemic treatments. For certain patients with advanced disease, allogeneic stem cell transplantation may offer prolonged survival, but the five-year survival rate is approximately 50%.

In our Phase 1 clinical trial of cobomarsen treating MF patients, we enrolled patients with mild/moderate to severe MF (stages I-III), without blood or node involvement. Cohorts were dosed by multiple routes of administration, including subcutaneous injection, or SQ injection, IV infusion, and intravenous bolus injection, or IV bolus. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed at doses of 300 mg, 600 mg and 900 mg for SQ injection and IV infusion and at 300 mg for IV bolus. Based on the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool, or mSWAT score, which is a measurement of the severity of skin disease over a patient’s entire body, 33 of 36 patients (92%) showed improvements in mSWAT scores. These improvements in mSWAT scores were observed as early as 17 days after a patient’s first dose (the first post-treatment assessment), with the greatest improvement in mSWAT scores seen after one or more months of dosing. Additionally, five of eight patients (63%) receiving 300 mg IV infusion have achieved a 50% or greater mSWAT score reduction and four (50%) maintained the response for at least four consecutive months. 
Based on results of the Phase 1 clinical trial and the outcomes of FDA meetings during 2018, we advanced cobomarsen into the global Phase 2 SOLAR clinical trial in patients with MF. SOLAR includes an open-label, parallel group, randomized design to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 300 mg of cobomarsen, given by IV infusion, versus Zolinza (vorinostat) as an active control. We have opened a number of clinical sites in the Phase 2 clinical trial, and we are planning to initiate activities at up to 60 clinical sites in 11 countries worldwide. The SOLAR trial is designed to enroll patients with moderate to severe MF (stages Ib-III), without node or blood involvement. The primary endpoint of the SOLAR trial is the rate of objective response that is durable for four months, defined as 50% or greater improvement in the severity of a patient’s skin disease over the entire body (mSWAT), with no evidence of disease progression in the blood, lymph nodes or viscera. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival and patient reported outcomes measuring overall quality of life as determined by validated instruments. Anticipated enrollment will include approximately 65 patients per treatment group. We expect to report data from SOLAR in the second half of 2020. Based on discussions with the FDA, we believe that a successful outcome for the primary endpoint of the SOLAR trial may allow us to apply for accelerated approval. LLS is collaborating with us and providing funding in support of the SOLAR trial for the treatment of patients with CTCL.
Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma
ATLL is a blood cell malignancy that develops in patients after prolonged infection with HTLV-1. Literature suggests that the infection with HTLV-1 as well as the subsequent malignancies may be associated with elevation in the expression of miR-155, the target of cobomarsen. ATLL is typified by abnormalities in blood counts and frequent opportunistic infections. The disease 
8

presents in multiple forms, but the most common and lethal include the acute, or leukemic, form and the lymphomatous version. These two manifestations lack good treatment options, and once the diagnosis is made, average life expectancy with standard chemotherapeutic treatment regimens is approximately four months for the acute leukemic form and approximately 10 months for the lymphomatous variety.
As of December 13, 2018, eight ATLL patients have been treated with cobomarsen in our expanded Phase 1 clinical trial. Five subjects with acute and lymphomatous ATLL in partial remission have the disease which has remained stable or improved while continuing on cobomarsen monotherapy from three to 13 months. Treatment is ongoing in all subjects at the time of the December 13, 2018 cut-off date for our most recent population. Three subjects, one relapsing with lymphomatous and two relapsing with significant skin involvement, were treated for less than one month and withdrew from the study. The lymphomatous patient relapsing after approximately seven months of chemotherapy was treated with cobomarsen for nine days (four doses). Though lactate dehydrogenase, or LDH, decreased by approximately 50% (3600 U/L on C1D1 to 1554 U/L on C1D12), CT scans showed a mixed response with some nodes decreasing, but others increasing in size, and the patient was discontinued. In addition to patients with clinical stabilization, certain patients have demonstrated a decrease in markers on the circulating tumor cells indicative of disease severity including Ki67, a marker of cell proliferation. Elevations of Ki67 have been shown to correlate with poor life expectancy for ATLL patients. To date, while on cobomarsen monotherapy, there have been no serious adverse effects, or SAEs, reported in patients related to study drug, and none of the patients demonstrated evidence of opportunistic infections.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
According to the Lymphoma Research Foundation, DLBCL is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, in the United States and worldwide, accounting for up to one-third of patients with newly diagnosed NHL in the United States. DLBCL is a fast-growing form of NHL that affects B-lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are one type of white blood cell. B-cells are lymphocytes that make antibodies to fight infections and are an important part of the immune system. DLBCL can develop in the lymph nodes or in areas outside the lymph nodes, such as the gastrointestinal tract, testes, thyroid, or essentially any organ of the body. It may be in one spot or spread throughout the body.
Approximately 40% of all DLBCL patients have refractory disease or disease that will relapse after an initial response, and the majority of patients with relapsed DLBCL will succumb to the disease. There are two major biologically distinct molecular subtypes of DLBCL: germinal center B-cell and activated B-cell, or ABC. ABC DLBCL is associated with substantially worse outcomes when treated with standard chemoimmunotherapy. One molecular distinction between the two subtypes is the understanding that NF-κB, a prosurvival and antiapoptotic molecule, is constitutively expressed and may be a key contributor to chemotherapy resistance in the ABC subgroup. In Part A of our Phase 1 clinical trial, we observed that cobomarsen inhibited the NF-κB pathway.
As of January 8, 2019, three DLBCL patients of the ABC subtype had received cobomarsen in the expanded Phase 1 clinical trial. One patient has seen a complete reduction in one of two measured lymph nodes and significant reduction and stabilization in the second lymph node after seven weeks of therapy. As of March 14, 2019, this patient remained on cobomarsen. Two of the three patients discontinued therapy after less than one month due to lack of immediate response. Previously, all three patients had relapsed after multiple cycles of other treatments with other therapies received over 12 to 56 months from diagnosis. Prior treatments for these patients ranged from standard of care to experimental chemotherapy.
We are also currently evaluating cobomarsen in a Phase 1 clinical trial in CLL. We retain worldwide rights for cobomarsen.
Remlarsen
Remlarsen is a replacement for, or mimic of, miR-29. We initially discovered the role of miR-29 in pathological cardiac fibrosis. Since this initial discovery, miR-29 has been implicated in pathological fibrosis in multiple organs including the skin, eye, lung, liver, tendon, muscle, and kidney. miR-29 is understood by the scientific community to play a role in the regulation of certain processes that contribute to fibrosis, including the initiation and maintenance of fibrosis through transforming growth factor beta, or TGF-ß, signaling and the deposition of the components that make up fibrotic tissue, including collagen and extracellular matrix, or ECM, proteins. Furthermore, both fibrotic ECM and TGF-ß are believed to down-regulate miR-29 levels, leading to continuously increased TGF-ß expression and uncontrolled ECM production. miR-29 levels are abnormally low in multiple fibrotic indications, and lower levels of miR-29 are correlated with increased severity of fibrosis. As such, we believe that normalizing levels of miR-29 could be beneficial in the treatment of several pathological fibrotic conditions. Although various fibrotic indications are potentially distinct, they share a number of features, including the activation of the cells that initiate the deposition of fibrotic tissue or fibroblast activation, excessive deposition of collagen and other fibrosis-associated pathways, and resulting organ dysfunction. We believe the functions and biomarkers regulated by miR-29 might be 
9

shared among multiple fibrotic indications and that increasing miR-29-like activity may provide potential benefit in any of these.
To demonstrate mechanistic proof-of-concept and as a potential initial indication, we initially focused on skin fibrosis. However, we believe data derived from skin fibrosis trials may facilitate development of a product candidate intended for the treatment of patients who suffer from Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, or IPF, ocular fibrosis, tendon fibrosis, and other major organ pathological fibrosis. We retain worldwide rights for remlarsen.
Pathological Fibrosis

Fibrosis describes the development of fibrous connective tissue as a response to injury or damage. Fibrosis may refer to the deposition of connective tissue that occurs as part of normal healing or to the excess tissue deposition that occurs as a disease process. When fibrosis occurs in response to injury, the term “scarring” is used. Pathological fibrosis can occur in many tissues of the body, either as a primary event or as a result of inflammation or damage. In every case, regardless of the trigger, collagen build up occurs, which can result in scarring of vital organs such as the skin, lung, liver, eye, kidney, tendon, muscle, and heart, leading to irreparable damage and eventual organ failure. In addition, fibrosis prevents the normal healing of the organs and further perpetuates the fibrotic process. We believe there is a significant need for additional clinical therapeutic approaches to treating pathological fibrosis.

Below is a description of several types of pathological fibrosis for which we may seek to develop a product candidate based on a replacement for miR-29:

Type of Pathological Fibrosis | Description
Skin Fibrosis |  | Scarring is a result of an over production of collagen in a healing wound. Scarring may continue to thicken for up to six months or may overgrow the site of the wound, even after the wound has healed. 
 |  | Hypertrophic scars and keloids are abnormal wound responses and represent an excessive connective tissue response to skin trauma, inflammation, surgery, or burns. 
 |  | Hypertrophic scars and keloids are characterized by local fibroblast proliferation and overproduction of collagen. Both hypertrophic scars and keloids are diseases that tend to be painful and itchy, restrict mobility, and are resistant to treatment. 
Pulmonary Fibrosis |  | Pulmonary fibrosis, also known as lung fibrosis, is caused by accumulation of scar tissues surrounding the air sacs (interstitial space) in the lung. As a result, the lung tissue becomes stiff and loses the ability to expand. The scar tissue also prevents normal transport of oxygen. The result is a progressive respiratory failure, with symptoms that include persistent cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing and fatigue. Pulmonary fibrosis leads to cardiac failure and death. Pulmonary fibrosis may occur as a secondary condition in various other diseases, but in many cases the underlying cause is not clear and is referred to as IPF.
 |  | IPF is a chronic, progressive lung disease which ultimately leads to death in many of the patients. This condition causes scar tissue to build up in the lungs, which makes the lungs unable to transport oxygen into the bloodstream effectively. 
Liver Fibrosis |  | Liver fibrosis refers to the scar tissue and nodules that replace liver tissue and disrupt liver function. Major causes of liver fibrosis are alcohol, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection, along with the metabolic disorders non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Liver fibrosis is a major global problem driven by increasing rates of obesity and diabetes. 
Eye Fibrosis |  | Infection or inflammation of the eye results in impairment of visual function. Chronic inflammation can ultimately lead to fibrosis. 
 |  | Eye fibrosis diseases include retinal fibrosis such as diabetic retinopathy and proliferative vitreoretinopathy, corneal fibrosis, glaucoma trabeculectomy, age-related macular degeneration, and Fuch’s endothelial corneal dystrophy. 

Remlarsen Clinical Development

In 2017, we announced the data from a single-center, Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple dose-escalation clinical trial for remlarsen that enrolled 54 healthy volunteers. In the trial, we observed mechanistic proof-of-concept for remlarsen, based on a statistically-significant reduction in fibroplasia, or scar tissue deposition, with no adverse effects on incisional wound healing when remlarsen was given.
10

In July 2018, we announced the initiation of a Phase 2 double-blind, randomized clinical trial of remlarsen, which is designed to treat fibrotic diseases, in subjects with a predisposition for keloid formation. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and activity of remlarsen in the prevention or reduction of keloid formation in subjects with a history of keloid scars, a persistent form of hypertrophic scarring. Keloids are a common condition that is disfiguring and can be painful, itchy, and emotionally troubling to those that experience them. They are typically smooth, hard, benign growths that form when scar tissue grows excessively. We anticipate that this clinical trial will initially enroll up to 12 patients who are historically predisposed to keloid formation after trauma to the skin at multiple clinical sites in the United States. Subjects will receive small, matching excisional wounds that will be sutured and then injected with either remlarsen or placebo. In this design, patients are serving as their own control, which increases the statistical power of the clinical trial. The lesions will be observed for up to 12 months to determine the presence or absence of keloid formation. We expect to report data from this clinical trial in the second half of 2019. We believe the results of the trial may help determine the dose, dose frequency, and number of patients necessary for a potential Phase 3 clinical trial of remlarsen in keloid revision or other syndromes associated with dermal scarring.
In October 2018, we announced data from our preclinical studies investigating the antifibrotic effects of remlarsen in corneal ulceration of rats. We believe the results obtained in the study suggest that topical application of remlarsen may be an effective treatment to improve vision in patients suffering from multiple conditions resulting in corneal scarring, which remains one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. We expect to report additional data from these preclinical studies in the first half of 2019.
MRG-110
We are developing MRG-110 (or S95010 per Servier) in collaboration with Servier. MRG-110 is an inhibitor of miR-92, which has been observed in preclinical studies to be a regulator of new blood vessel creation. We believe that miR-92 inhibitors may improve heart function in patients suffering from chronic heart failure, or CHF. We also believe that MRG-110’s ability to induce new blood vessel growth may accelerate and improve healing and thus potentially decrease complications of surgically created or naturally occurring wounds in a variety of settings. MRG-110 is our third product candidate to enter human clinical trials and is currently in two Phase 1 clinical trials in collaboration with Servier to evaluate its potential use in the treatment of heart failure and other conditions where patients may benefit from increased vascular flow and accelerated healing, such as complicated lacerations in high risk patients and burns.
Chronic Heart Failure Physiopathology
The imbalance between oxygen demand and supply to cardiomyocytes, or cells in the heart responsible for pumping blood, plays an important role in the pathophysiology of heart failure. CHF is associated with a decrease of myocardial blood flow that begins at the early stages of the heart failure. The preservation of the small blood vessels of the heart is able to increase blood flow in case of increased demand. In CHF, this coronary flow reserve was shown to be reduced secondary to capillary dysfunction and a decrease in density of these vessels, limiting oxygen supply to cardiomyocytes. Analysis of heart tissue from patients suffering from CHF revealed a reduction of coronary microvascular density. Sixty percent of cases of CHF patients with reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF, have an ischemic origin. Progressive loss of cardiomyocytes and increase in fibrosis decrease capillary density. Compensatory elongation and hypertrophy of remaining cardiomyocytes further increase capillary length and inter-capillary distance reducing oxygenation.
CHF is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the world. The prognosis remains poor with 45-60% mortality five years after diagnosis. Quality of life in patients is impaired, from mild to severe limitations in daily life. To date, SOC treatment slows down the progression of disease by inhibiting the neuro-hormonal activation and reducing vascular bed congestion. Coronary revascularization, with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary arterial bypass grafting, have been shown to improve patient prognosis when the obstruction is located in the epicardial coronaries but is generally of no benefit in cases when the flow is limited downstream in the microcirculatory network. We believe that new reparative/regenerative solutions are needed for improving patient cardiac function that could consequently make a difference in daily quality of life with a further reduction in morbidity and mortality. The restoration of the microcirculation appears to be a potentially innovative therapeutic way to improve cardiac function.
MRG-110 was observed to reduce infarct size in multiple preclinical models of acute myocardial infarction, leading to an improved cardiac function. The cardioprotective effects were correlated with reduced cell death, reduced inflammation, and improved neovascularization of the affected myocardium. Similar effects were also observed in pig hibernating myocardium, a model of chronic ischemia, thought to be more representative of human cardiomyopathies.
11

Cutaneous wounds
In preclinical studies, we recently observed MRG-110 accelerating wound healing in normal, healthy farm pigs. In induced excisional wounds in healthy pigs, MRG-110 appeared to result in increased perfusion, measured by laser Doppler imaging on Day 14, and more rapid wound closure compared to wounds in control animals treated similarly with vehicle control or SOC. Within the dermal portion of the wound bed, there was a dose dependent increase in granulation tissue and in vascularization on day 49, five weeks after the last dose, in the wounds treated with MRG-110 compared with SOC-treated wounds. We believe the effects on wound healing seen in animal models support further evaluation of MRG-110 for its potential to improve wound healing by increasing revascularization and granulation tissue formation, and ultimately wound closure in acute settings. The potential indications include acceleration and improvement of wound healing in indications such as burns, skin flaps, grafts, or laparotomy or sternotomy incisions in patients with high risk of poor wound closure.
In 2018, we began evaluating MRG-110 in two Phase 1 clinical trials. Both clinical trials are designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MRG-110. The data generated in these clinical trials is expected to provide several clinically translatable biomarkers that may support future clinical trials. We expect to report data from these clinical trials in 2019.
We are developing MRG-110 with Servier under our license and collaboration agreement, or the Servier Collaboration Agreement. Under the Servier Collaboration Agreement, we granted Servier exclusive licenses to commercialize MRG-110 and other product candidates targeting miR-92 in the field of cardiovascular disease in all countries except the United States and Japan. We also granted Servier the right to name one additional microRNA target under our collaboration agreement through September 2019. We retain all rights to licensed programs under the Servier Collaboration Agreement in the field of cardiovascular disease in the United States and Japan and for all non-cardiovascular indications worldwide.
Background on microRNAs

microRNAs are transcribed from the genome and unlike messenger RNA, or mRNA, they do not encode proteins. microRNAs function by preventing the translation of mRNAs into proteins and/or by triggering degradation of these mRNAs. Studies have shown that microRNA gene regulation is often not a decisive on and off switch but a subtle function that fine-tunes cellular phenotypes that becomes more pronounced during stress or disease conditions. microRNAs were first discovered in 1993 and have since been found in nearly every biological system examined since that time. They are highly conserved across species, demonstrating their importance to biological functions and cellular processes. According to the Sanger Institute, over 2,000 microRNAs have been identified in humans.

A body of evidence has shown that inappropriate levels of particular microRNAs are directly linked to a range of serious diseases, many of which are poorly served by existing therapies. microRNAs can affect the balance of protein expression and serve as “command and control” nodes that directly coordinate multiple critical systems simultaneously. This effect on systems biology is a naturally occurring homeostatic process that becomes disrupted in certain disease states. As a result, developing microRNA-based therapeutics is fundamentally different from the single-protein, single-target approach that is the foundation of traditional small and large molecule drugs. 

Our Approach to Drug Discovery and Development

Our research and development strategy is designed to accelerate timelines and reduce development risk. The goal of our translational medicine strategy is to progress rapidly to first-in-human trials once we have adequately established mechanistic proof-of-concept, consisting of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and manufacturability of the product candidate in preclinical studies. Programs that progress into human trials are designed to be accompanied by a validated set of pharmacodynamic biomarkers that allow us to verify the mechanism of drug action in humans and to potentially stratify and enrich the study population. Through this approach, we seek to reduce the risk of our programs by quantifying target engagement and identifying the likely efficacious dose prior to progression to Phase 2 clinical trials.
Discovery

Although there are over 2,000 identified human microRNAs, not all of them have been shown to be causal in disease. Our approach to drug discovery and development begins with the identification of potentially pathological microRNAs.

We apply three general approaches to the identification of potentially pathological, or disease-causing, microRNAs: (i) profiling of microRNA expression in diseased tissue versus normal tissue to identify microRNAs that are found at abnormally high or low levels; (ii) identification of microRNAs that are located within genes (typically in non-protein coding segments) of 
12

validated disease-relevant genes and thus simultaneously expressed with the disease associated gene; and (iii) evaluation of microRNAs that are predicted to directly modulate the expression of specific, disease-relevant genes.

We believe that the microRNA inhibitor candidates face lower delivery hurdles compared to microRNA mimics and have better drug-like properties in regard to affinity to their targets, stability, drug distribution, and pharmacodynamics. To improve their therapeutic potential, we chemically modify these compounds with changes such as LNA substitution of the ribose sugar in many of the nucleosides, and deoxyribonucleoside, or DNA.

In conditions where a deficit in microRNA expression has been identified as disease causing, microRNA replacements, which are modified, double-stranded RNA structures that are recognized by the RNA-induced silencing complex can serve as chemically-synthesized replacements for microRNAs.

Historically, the delivery of double stranded RNAs, such as microRNA replacements, has been a significant hurdle to overcome for drug development because these molecules are very rapidly degraded and because uptake into cells can be inefficient. Our delivery approach for double-stranded microRNA replacements is to append a conjugate to the molecule to enhance cellular uptake. The selection of the conjugate is dependent upon the intended therapeutic use. We have deployed hydrophobic conjugates, such as cholesterol, that are able to improve pharmacokinetics and allow for enhanced cellular uptake. We are also exploring a range of conjugates that help in targeting specific tissues and cells. Our strategy with microRNA replacements has centered on opportunities for efficient delivery of the molecules with an emphasis on local and topical applications, such as injections in the skin, eye, or lung. For organs where topical or local applications are not feasible, such as the liver, we have employed conjugates that have demonstrated successful delivery after systemic administration.

Development

Our approach to translational medicine is focused on rapidly testing the molecular hypothesis in human cell lines and animal models to demonstrate safety and measure pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and finally designing and conducting small, efficient, and targeted human Phase 1 clinical trials. We typically select an initial indication that is genetically defined or is a rare disease where abnormal levels of a microRNA have been implicated. These early-stage Phase 1 clinical trials are designed to test the mechanistic relevance and develop mechanistic proof-of-concept in humans in a setting that provides the opportunity to develop a biomarker toolkit for a mechanism of action that we believe has broader disease relevance.

The mechanistic proof-of-concept studies are designed to provide relevant information that helps to reduce development risks in humans. Our aim is to demonstrate that the expression levels of the microRNA could potentially serve as a diagnostic indicator that allows for better patient selection for later clinical trials and in additional indications. At the same time, we seek to confirm molecular activity of the drug.

By measuring the pharmacodynamics of target engagement, we are able to show that the product candidate effectively enters the appropriate cell and binds to its intended target. This process is particularly important for oligonucleotide drugs. We can also measure the effects on a series of downstream genes that create a plausible link between target engagement and a mechanism of disease.

Exploratory endpoints can provide us with verification of the pharmacodynamic effects of the drug based on biomarker readouts and morphological alterations. This translational strategy allows us to answer many questions about the drug target pair and provides improved confidence that the molecular basis of drug action is relevant in humans. Having built confidence in the drug mechanism and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, later-stage clinical trials will be designed to establish appropriate dose and therapeutic efficacy.

Our Strategic Collaborations and License Agreements

Strategic Alliance and Collaboration with Servier

In October 2011, we entered into the Servier Collaboration Agreement with Servier for the research, development, and commercialization of RNA-targeting therapeutics in cardiovascular disease. Under the Servier Collaboration Agreement, we granted Servier an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize RNA-targeting therapeutics for certain microRNA targets in the cardiovascular field. In 2017, the Servier Collaboration Agreement was amended to remove all existing targets, add one new target (miR-92), and grant Servier the right to add one additional target through September 2019.
In April 2018, together with Servier, we entered into a seventh amendment to the Servier Collaboration Agreement, or the Servier Amendment. The Servier Amendment, among other things, (i) updated the development plan for MRG-110 and cost-
13

sharing provisions; (ii) provided for specified development cost reimbursement by Servier to us following a determination by a joint committee established by the parties under the Servier Collaboration Agreement that the outcome of a specified portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial has met its primary end point; and (iii) provided for additional development plan cost reimbursement by Servier to us following a determination by a joint committee established by the parties under the Servier Collaboration Agreement that a product candidate targeting miR-92 will proceed into a Phase 2 clinical trial.
Servier’s rights to each named target are limited to therapeutics in the field of cardiovascular disease, as defined, and in their territory, which is worldwide except for the United States and Japan. We retain all other rights including commercialization of therapeutics developed under the Servier Collaboration Agreement in the field of cardiovascular disease in the United States and Japan.
During 2018, we recorded a development milestone of €3.0 million ($3.7 million). We are eligible to receive non-refundable development milestone payments of €5.8 million to €13.8 million ($6.6 million to $15.8 million as of December 31, 2018) and regulatory milestone payments of €10.0 million to €40.0 million ($11.4 million to $45.8 million as of December 31, 2018) for each target. Additionally, we may receive up to €175.0 million ($200.3 million as of December 31, 2018) in commercialization milestones, as well as quarterly royalty payments expressed in percentages ranging from the low-double digits to the mid-teens (subject to reductions for patent expiration, generic competition, third-party royalty, and costs of goods) on the net sales of any licensed product commercialized by Servier. Servier is obligated to make royalty payments for a period specified under the Servier Collaboration Agreement.
The development of each product candidate (commencing with registration enabling toxicology studies) under the Servier Collaboration Agreement is performed pursuant to a mutually agreed upon development plan to be conducted by the parties as necessary to generate data useful for both parties to obtain regulatory approval of such product candidates. Servier is responsible for a specified percentage of the cost of research and development activities under the development plan through the completion of one or more Phase 2 clinical trials and will reimburse us for a specified portion of such costs that we incur. The costs of Phase 3 clinical trials for each product candidate will be allocated between the parties at a specified percentage of costs. The applicable percentage for each product candidate will be based upon whether certain events under the Servier Collaboration Agreement occur, including if we enter into a third-party agreement for the development and/or commercialization of a product in the United States at least 180 days before the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial, or if we subsequently enter into a U.S. partner agreement, or if we do not enter into a U.S. partner agreement but file for approval in the United States using data from the Phase 3 clinical trial. 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized as revenue amounts reimbursable to us under the Servier Collaboration Agreement of $3.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively.
Under the Servier Collaboration Agreement, we also granted Servier a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to develop a companion diagnostic in its territory for any therapeutic product that may be developed by Servier under the Servier Collaboration Agreement. We also granted Servier an exclusive, royalty-free license to commercialize such a companion diagnostic in our territory for use in connection with the development and commercialization of such therapeutic product in its territory.
The Servier Collaboration Agreement will expire as to each underlying product candidate when Servier’s royalty obligations as to such product candidate have expired. Servier may also terminate the Servier Collaboration Agreement for: (i) convenience upon a specified number of days’ prior notice to us or (ii) upon determination of a safety issue relating to development under the agreement upon a specified number of days’ prior notice to us. Either party may terminate the Servier Collaboration Agreement upon a material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified number of days. We may also terminate the agreement if Servier challenges any of the patents licensed by us to Servier. 
License Agreements with the University of Texas

As of December 31, 2018, we had two exclusive patent license agreements, or the UT License Agreements, with the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, or the University of Texas. Under each of the UT License Agreements, the University of Texas granted us exclusive and nonexclusive licenses to certain patent and technology rights. The University of Texas is one of our minority stockholders.
In consideration of rights granted by the University of Texas, we agreed to: (i) pay a nonrefundable upfront license documentation fee in the amount of $10 thousand per license; (ii) pay an annual license maintenance fee in the amount of $10 thousand per license starting one year from the date of each agreement; (iii) reimburse the University of Texas for actual costs incurred in conjunction with the filing, prosecution, enforcement, and maintenance of patent rights prior to the effective date; 
14

and (iv) bear all future costs of and manage the filing, prosecution, enforcement, and maintenance of patent rights. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred immaterial upfront and maintenance fees, which were recorded as research and development expense. All costs related to the filing, prosecution, and maintenance of patent and technology rights are recorded as general and administrative expense when incurred.
Under the terms of the UT License Agreements, we may be obligated to make the following future milestone payments for each licensed product candidate: (i) up to approximately $0.6 million upon the initiation of defined clinical trials; (ii) $2.0 million upon regulatory approval in the United States; and (iii) $0.5 million per region upon regulatory approval in other specified regions. Additionally, if we or any of our sublicensees successfully commercialize any product candidate subject to the UT License Agreements, we are responsible for royalty payments in the low-single digits based upon net sales of such licensed products and payments at a percentage in the mid-teens of any sublicense income, subject to specified exceptions. The University of Texas’s right to the royalty payments will expire as to each license agreement upon the expiration of the last patent claim subject to the applicable UT License Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we made an immaterial milestone payment, which is included in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Prior to December 31, 2018, we did not incur any milestone payments.
The license term extends on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents that covers such product in such country. Upon expiration of the royalty payment obligation, we will have a fully paid license in such country. We may also terminate each UT License Agreement for convenience upon a specified number of days’ prior notice to the University of Texas. The University of Texas also has the right to earlier terminate the UT License Agreements after a defined date under specified circumstances where we have effectively abandoned our research and development efforts or have no sales. The UT License Agreements will terminate under customary termination provisions including automatic termination upon our bankruptcy or insolvency, upon notice of an uncured material breach, and upon mutual written consent. All charges incurred under the UT License Agreements have been expensed to date due to the uncertainty as to future economic benefit from the acquired rights.
License Agreement with Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen A/S (formerly Santaris Pharma A/S)

In June 2010, we entered into a license agreement with the Santaris Pharma A/S, which was subsequently acquired by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, or Roche, in 2014, and subsequently changed its name to Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen A/S, or RICC. The agreement was amended in October 2011 and amended and restated in December 2012, or the RICC License Agreement. 
Under the RICC License Agreement, we received exclusive and nonexclusive licenses from RICC to use specified technology of RICC, or the RICC Technology, for specified uses including research, development, and commercialization of pharmaceutical products using this technology worldwide. Under the RICC License Agreement, we have the right to develop and commercialize the RICC Technology directed to four specified targets and the option to obtain exclusive product licenses for up to six additional targets. The acquisition of Santaris Pharma A/S by Roche was considered a change-of-control under the RICC License Agreement, and as such, certain terms and conditions of the RICC License Agreement changed, as contemplated and in accordance with the RICC License Agreement. These changes primarily relate to milestone payments reflected in the disclosures below. If we exercise our option to obtain additional product licenses or to replace the target families, we will be required to make additional payments to RICC.
Under the terms of the RICC License Agreement, milestone payments were previously decreased by a specified percentage as a result of the change of control by RICC referenced above. We are obligated to make milestone payments for each licensed product of up to $5.2 million, which is inclusive of a potential product license option fee. Certain of these milestones will be increased by a specified percentage if we undergo a change-of-control during the term of the RICC License Agreement. If we grant a third party a sublicense to the RICC Technology, we are required to remit to Roche up to a specified percentage of the upfront and milestone and other specified payments that we receive under its sublicense, and if such sublicense covers use of the RICC Technology in the United States or the entire European Union, or EU, we will not have any further obligation to pay the fixed milestone payments noted above. 
If we or our sublicensee successfully commercializes any product candidate subject to the RICC License Agreements, then RICC is entitled to royalty payments in the mid-single digits on the net sales of such product, provided that if such net sales are made by a sublicensee under the RICC License Agreement, RICC is entitled to royalty payments equal to the lesser of a percentage in the mid-single digits on the net sales of such product or a specified percentage of the royalties paid to us by such sublicensee, subject to specified restrictions. We are obligated to make any such royalty payments until the later of: (i) a specified anniversary of the first commercial sale of the applicable product or (ii) the expiration of the last valid patent claim licensed by RICC under the RICC License Agreement underlying such product. Upon the occurrence of specified events, the 
15

royalty owed to RICC will be decreased by a specified percentage. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $0.7 million in expense related to a milestone reached, which is included in research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
The RICC License Agreement will terminate upon the latest of the expiration of all of RICC’s royalty rights, the termination of the last Miragen target or the expiration of its right to obtain a product license for a new target under the RICC License Agreement. We may also terminate the RICC License Agreement for convenience upon a specified number of days’ prior notice to RICC, subject to specified terms and conditions. Either party may terminate the RICC License Agreement upon an uncured material breach by the other party and RICC may terminate the RICC License Agreement upon the occurrence of other specified events immediately or after such event is not cured within a specified number of days, as applicable.
All charges incurred under the RICC License Agreement have been expensed to date due to the uncertainty as to future economic benefit from the acquired rights.
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we paid $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, to RICC for raw materials to be used in our drug manufacturing process.
Subcontract Agreement with Yale University
In October 2014, together with Yale University, or Yale, we entered into a subcontract agreement and into a subaward agreement in March 2015, or the Yale Agreements, which was subsequently amended. Under the Yale Agreements, we are providing specified services regarding the development of a proprietary compound that targets miR-29 in the indication of IPF. Yale entered into the Yale Agreements in connection with a grant that Yale received from the NIH for the development of a miR-29 mimic as a potential therapy for pulmonary fibrosis.
In consideration of our services under the Yale Agreements, Yale has agreed to reimburse us a specified amount over five years, subject to the availably of funds under the grant and continued eligibility. Under the terms of the Yale Agreements, we retain all rights to any and all intellectual property developed solely by us in connection with the Yale Agreements. Yale has also agreed to provide us with an exclusive option to negotiate in good faith for an exclusive, royalty-bearing license from Yale for any intellectual property developed by Yale or jointly by the parties under the Yale Agreements. Yale is responsible for filing, prosecuting, and maintaining foreign and domestic patent applications and patents on all inventions jointly developed by the parties under the Yale Agreements. Through December 31, 2018, we received $0.9 million under the Yale Agreements.
The Yale Agreements terminate automatically on the date that Yale delivers its final research report to the NIH under the terms of the grant underlying the Yale Agreements. Each party may also terminate the Yale Agreements upon a specified number of days’ notice if the NIH’s grant funding is reduced or terminated or upon material breach by the other party.
License Agreements with the t2cure GmbH

In October 2010, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the t2cure Agreement, with t2cure GmbH, or t2cure, which was subsequently amended. Under the t2cure Agreement, we received a worldwide, royalty bearing, and exclusive license to specified patent and technology rights relating to miR-92.
In consideration of rights granted by t2cure, we paid an upfront fee of $46 thousand and agreed to: (i) pay an annual license maintenance fee in the amount of €3 thousand ($3 thousand as of December 31, 2018) and (ii) reimburse t2cure for costs incurred in conjunction with the filing, prosecution, enforcement, and maintenance of patent rights. 
Under the terms of the t2cure Agreement, we are obligated to make the following future milestone payments for each licensed product, as defined in the t2cure Agreement: (i) up to approximately $0.7 million upon the initiation of certain defined clinical trials; (ii) $2.5 million upon regulatory approval in the United States; and (iii) up to $1.5 million per region upon regulatory approval in the EU or Japan. Additionally, if we or any of our sublicensees successfully commercializes any product candidate subject to the t2cure Agreement, we are responsible for royalty payments equal to percentages in the low-single digits upon net sales of licensed products, and under specified circumstances, sublicense fees equal to a percentage in the low twenties of sublicense income received by us. We are obligated to make any such royalty payment until the later of: (i) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the applicable product or (ii) the expiration of the last valid claim to a patent licensed by t2cure under the t2cure Agreement covering such product. If such patent claims expire prior to the end of the ten-year term, then the royalty owed to t2cure will be decreased by a specified percentage. We also have the right to decrease our royalty payments by a specified percentage for royalties paid to third parties for licenses to certain third-party intellectual property.
16

The license term extends on a country-by-country basis until the later of: (i) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a country, and (ii) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim that claims such licensed product in such country. Upon expiration of the royalty payment obligation, we will have a fully paid license in such country. We have the right to terminate the t2cure Agreement at will, on a country-by-country basis, after 60 days’ written notice. The t2cure Agreement will also automatically terminate upon our bankruptcy or insolvency or upon notice of an uncured material breach.
All charges incurred under the t2cure Agreement have been expensed to date, due to the uncertainty as to future economic benefit from the acquired rights.
License Agreement with The Brigham and Women’s Hospital

In May 2016, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement, or the BWH License Agreement, with The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, or BWH. Under the BWH License Agreement, we have an exclusive, worldwide license, including a right to sublicense, to specified patent rights and a nonexclusive, worldwide license, including a right to sublicense, to specified technology rights of BWH, each related to certain microRNAs believed to be involved in various neurodegenerative disorders. As consideration for these rights, we are obligated to pay a specified annual license fee. BWH is also entitled to milestone payments of up to approximately $2.6 million for each of our product candidates developed based on the patent rights subject to the BWH License Agreement plus a one-time sales milestone payment of $0.3 million for all product candidates developed based on the patent rights subject to the BWH License Agreement. If we successfully commercialize any product candidate subject to the BWH License Agreement, then BWH is entitled to royalty payments in the low-single digits on the net sales of such product. BWH’s right to these royalty payments will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last patent claim in such country that is subject to the BWH License Agreement and covers the product, and our license to such product in such country will become fully paid at such time. BWH is also entitled to a percentage in the low-double digits of any sublicense income from such product, subject to specified exceptions. We are also responsible for all costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of the patent rights subject to the BWH License Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to use commercially-reasonable efforts to develop a product under the BWH License Agreement and to meet specified diligence milestones thereunder.
The BWH License Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of all issued patents and patent applications subject to the patent rights under the agreement. We may also terminate the BWH License Agreement for convenience upon a specified number of days’ prior notice to BWH. BWH may terminate the BWH License Agreement upon a breach by us of our payment obligations and upon the occurrence of other specified events that are not cured within a specified number of days, provided that such termination is automatic upon our bankruptcy or insolvency.
Manufacturing

We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of cobomarsen, remlarsen, MRG-110, or other product candidates that we develop, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and finished product candidates for our clinical trials. We do not have any current contractual arrangements for the manufacture of commercial supplies of cobomarsen, remlarsen, MRG-110, or any other product candidates that we develop. We currently employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing contractors.
Sales and Marketing

We have not yet defined our sales, marketing, or product distribution strategy for cobomarsen, remlarsen, MRG-110, or any of our other product candidates because our product candidates are still in preclinical or early-stage clinical development. Our commercial strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sale force, or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval for one of our product candidates.

17

Intellectual Property

We are actively building an intellectual property portfolio around our clinical-stage product candidates and discovery programs. A key component of this portfolio strategy is to seek patent protection in the United States and in major market countries that we consider important to the development of our business worldwide. As of December 31, 2018, we have a portfolio of 291 patents and applications of which 179 are issued or allowed and 112 are pending applications. This portfolio includes methods of use and composition patents, and patent applications on our three lead product candidates, cobomarsen, remlarsen, and MRG-110. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates and other discoveries, inventions, trade secrets and know-how that are critical to our business operations. Our success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and in part, on our ability to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. A comprehensive discussion on risks relating to intellectual property is provided under “Risk Factors” under the subsection “Risks Related to our Intellectual Property”. 
We have filed patent applications directed to compositions of matter and methods of use covering cobomarsen in the United States and under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, to access foreign countries. A U.S. patent application issued as U.S. 9,771,585 on September 26, 2017, which will expire in June of 2036 if we continue to pay the maintenance fees and annuities when due, with the possibility of Patent Term Extension that may be granted by the USPTO due to administrative delays in the FDA. Prior to the issue of this application, we filed a continuation application in August 2017 directed to methods of treatment, as U.S. 15/677,818, and this application is currently pending. We also filed an U.S. application directed to compositions of matter through the PCT, as U.S. 15/714,671, and this application issued as U.S. 9,994,852 on June 12, 2018, which will expire in June of 2036 if we continue to pay the maintenance fees and annuities when due. Prior to the issue of this application, we filed a continuation application in May 2018 as U.S. 15/976,333, and this application is currently pending.

We expect these pending applications will issue as U.S. patents in the next one to three years, with a projected expiration year of 2036 if we continue to pay the maintenance fees and annuities when due, with the possibility of additional terms from the USPTO prosecution delays and from patent term extensions that may be granted due to administrative delays in the FDA. We also have pending applications that cover methods of use of cobomarsen and related compositions. Collectively, these applications, if they issue, would have patent expirations from 2036 if we continue to pay the maintenance fees and annuities when due, not including any possible additional terms for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. We do not know if any patent will issue from any of these applications and, if any issue, we do not know whether the issued patents will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage against our competitors or generics. Even if they are issued, our patents may be circumvented, challenged, opposed, and found to be invalid or unenforceable.

We have filed patent applications directed to compositions of matter and methods of use covering MRG-110 in the U.S. and under the PCT, to access foreign countries. A patent directed to compositions of matter and methods of use of MRG-110 issued as U.S. 9,803,202, on October 31, 2017, and will expire in June 2033 if we continue to pay the maintenance fees and annuities when due, with the possibility of Patent Term Extension that may be granted by the USPTO due to administrative delays in the FDA. We also have issued patents and pending applications that cover various therapeutic uses and generic compositions of matter comprising MRG-110. Collectively, these patents and patent applications, if they issue, would have patent expirations ranging from 2028 to 2036 if we continue to pay the maintenance fees and annuities when due, not including any possible additional terms for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. We do not know if any patent will issue from any of the pending applications and, if any issue, we do not know whether the issued patents will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage against our competitors or generics. Even if they are issued, our patents may be circumvented, challenged, opposed, and found to be invalid or unenforceable.
We have filed patent applications directed to compositions of matter and methods of use covering remlarsen in the United States and under the PCT to access foreign countries. A U.S. patent application issued as U.S. 9,376,681 on June 28, 2016, which will expire in September of 2035 if we continue to pay the maintenance fees and annuities when due, with the possibility of Patent Term Extension that may be granted by the USPTO due to administrative delays in the FDA. Prior to the issue of this application, we filed a continuation application in June 2016 also directed to compositions of matter in the United States, as U.S. 15/175,636, and this application issued as U.S. 9,994,847 on June 12, 2018, which will expire in September of 2035, if we continue to pay the maintenance fees and annuities when due. Prior to the issue of this application, we filed a continuation application in June 2018, as U.S. 16/002,845, and this application is currently pending. We also have issued patents and pending applications that cover various therapeutic uses and generic compositions comprising remlarsen. Collectively, these patents and patent applications, if they issue, would have patent expirations ranging from 2028 to 2035 if we continue to pay the maintenance fees and annuities when due, not including any possible additional terms for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. We do not know if any patent will issue from any of the pending applications and, if any issue, we do not know whether the issued patents will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage against our 
18

competitors or generics. Even if they are issued, our patents may be circumvented, challenged, opposed, and found to be invalid or unenforceable.

For our earlier stage product candidates, we have filed compositions of matter and methods of use patent applications in the United States, and under the PCT to access foreign countries.

In addition to patent protection, we seek to rely on trade secret protection, trademark protection and know-how to expand our proprietary position around our chemistry, technology and other discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business. We also seek to protect our intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators, and other contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors, and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of any discoveries or inventions made by them. Further, we seek trademark protection in the United States and internationally where available and when we deem appropriate. We have obtained registrations for the Miragen trademark, which we use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development services as well as our clinical-stage product candidates. We currently have such registrations for Miragen in the United States, Canada, Japan, and the EU.
Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. Our clinical and preclinical product candidates may address multiple markets. Ultimately, the diseases our product candidates target for which we may receive marketing authorization will determine our competition. We believe that for most or all of our product development programs, there will be one or more competing programs under development by other companies. Any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. In many cases, the companies with competing programs will have access to greater resources and expertise than we do and may be more advanced in those programs.

We believe that our current and future competition for resources and eventually for customers can be grouped into three broad categories:

• | companies working to develop microRNA targeted products, including Regulus Therapeutics Inc. and InteRNA Technologies B.V.;


• | companies working to develop other types of oligonucleotide therapeutic products, including Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., STELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc., Silence Therapeutics AG, and Translate Bio, Inc.; and


• | companies with marketed products and development programs for therapeutics that treat the same diseases for which we may also be developing potential treatments.

The following companies have therapeutics marketed or in development for CTCL: Argenx, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Celgene Corporation, Helsinn Group, innate Pharma, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Merck & Co., Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., Novartis International AG, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Seattle Genetics, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. 
The following companies have marketed therapeutics for pulmonary fibrosis: Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.

We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the success of any of our product candidates, if commercialized, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors relative to such competing products. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors have products that are superior in one or more of these categories.

Government Regulation

FDA Drug Approval Process

In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as imposition of clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, warning or untitled letters, withdrawal of approval, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.

We cannot market a drug product candidate in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated at that site;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.

Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. An IND sponsor must submit the results of preclinical testing to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.

A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin if all other requirements, including IRB review and approval, have been met. If the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, including GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the 
20

parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 

The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB for approval at each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to study metabolism of the drug, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal trials, are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome, and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing, and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees. These fees are typically increased annually. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality, and purity.

The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts-for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, 
21

be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. 

A REMS can include a medication guide, a communication plan for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, such as special training and certification requirements for individuals who prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry, and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. Such supplements are typically reviewed within 10 months of receipt by the FDA.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or a biological license application, or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application fee. 
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs

The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for development and review of new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drug products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request that the FDA designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. For a Fast Track-designated product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. If the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy 
22

exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug product subject to accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.

In addition, the Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of Fast Track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is distinct from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and the FDA will either grant or deny the request.

Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process by allowing for approval based on a surrogate endpoint likely to predict clinical benefit of the underlying drug, rather than through a direct measure of clinical benefit. Even if we receive one of these designations for our product candidates, the FDA may later decide that our product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification. In addition, these designations may not provide us with a material commercial advantage. 

Post-Approval Requirements

Once an NDA is approved, a product may be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-approval testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications or suspension or revocation of product approvals;

23


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products, or injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.

Foreign Regulation

In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions.

Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, a clinical trial may proceed in that country. To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The MAA is similar to the NDA, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.

In Canada, biopharmaceutical product candidates are regulated by the Food and Drugs Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which are enforced by the Therapeutic Products Directorate of Health Canada, or TPD. Before commencing clinical trials in Canada, an applicant must complete preclinical studies and file a CTA with the TPD. After filing a CTA, the applicant must receive different clearance authorizations to proceed with Phase 1 clinical trials, which can then lead to Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug in Canada, a new drug submission, or NDS, must be filed with the TPD. If the NDS demonstrates that the product was developed in accordance with the regulatory authorities’ rules, regulations, and guidelines and demonstrates favorable safety and efficacy and receives a favorable risk/benefit analysis, the TPD issues a notice of compliance which allows the applicant to market the product. 

Other Regulations

Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our current and future business operations may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws or regulations include, without limitation, state, federal, and foreign anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws or regulations. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.

24

Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.

The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties. 

The Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information for all payments and transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices, and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians.

Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we intend to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal control to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated.
25

International data protection laws, including, without limitation, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and EU member state data protection legislation, also apply to health-related and other personal data that we process, including, without limitation, personal data relating to clinical trial participants in the EU. The GDPR imposes, significant obligations on controllers and processors of personal data, including, among other things, standards relating to the privacy and security of personal data, which require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information. These laws also include, without limitation, requirements for establishing an appropriate legal basis for processing personal data, transparency requirements related to communications with data subjects regarding the processing of their personal data, notification requirements to individuals about the processing of their personal data, an individual data rights regime, mandatory data breach notifications, limitations on the retention of personal data, increased requirements pertaining to health data, and strict rules and restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, including to the United States. The GDPR also imposes obligations and required contractual provisions to be included in contracts between companies subject to the GDPR and their third-party processors that relate to the processing of personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant regulatory fines and penalties.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, regulatory, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, individual imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.

Health Reform

In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to healthcare systems that could affect our future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.

In particular, the Affordable Care Act has had a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the Affordable Care Act revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products.

Since its enactment, certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act have faced Congressional and judicial challenges. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Resolution is not a law; however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of repeal legislation. Further, on January 20, 2017, an Executive Order was signed, directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also has considered subsequent legislation to repeal or replace elements of the Affordable Care Act. In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of its product candidates.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 

Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among its requirements, manufacturers need to provide certain information 
26

regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.

Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.

Coverage and Reimbursement

Sales of our product candidates, once approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, private health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such products. Sales of our product candidates, and any future product candidates, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates, and any future product candidates, will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for our product candidates, and any future product candidates, will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a costly and time-consuming process.

Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and transparency requirements, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering in June 2014, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 in this Annual Report as the “JOBS Act,” and references to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
