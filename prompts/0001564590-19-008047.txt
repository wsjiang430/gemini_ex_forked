Antenna Design and Testing
 We are an antenna solution provider that not only has the expertise in antenna design, engineering and integration, but also the testing and optimization of OTA throughput. Our expertise is based on years of experience in dealing with multiple antenna designs performing under varying RF conditions. We believe our expertise is important to our success as the wireless RF environment in homes, enterprises, and public places is a highly complex multipath environment that is not accurately represented by antenna simulation tool modeling. While common antenna industry practice is to design antennas exclusively within a passive environment using simulation tools based on the assumption of free space, we design all our antenna systems using a combination of device and environment modeling combined with active antenna OTA throughput performance feedback.
 This performance feedback loop forms the foundation of our integration process that optimizes overall device performance, as well as antenna characteristics. Our regional OTA testing facilities are configured to replicate the real-world performance in typical homes and offices, while providing isolation from external RF and wireless interference. This low noise environment is key when comparing and identifying the effect of various antenna and system designs on wireless throughput performance. We have multiple dedicated test sites located in the vicinity of our development locations in San Diego, California, Melbourne, Florida, Cambridge, United Kingdom, and Suzhou and Shenzhen, China.

We believe there is significant potential for growth of our service offering revenue, including through renewable service provider service contracts, and to further leverage this offering to customers and applications in adjacent markets.
 Over the next several years, we believe the adoption of 5G on a global basis will offer incremental growth opportunities for us. According to ABI Research, 25% of network traffic will be 5G by 2023.  5G antenna systems are more complex as they need to support complex active architectures for new configurations such as active MIMO, and new frequency ranges in the sub-6GHz and mmWave, or millimeter wave, frequency bands. This shift in antenna complexity favors us, since complexity implies an opportunity to provide increased value to our customers along with increasing opportunity to differentiate based on technical merit and performance.  
 The adoption of 5G will require antenna solutions for small cell indoor and outdoor, fixed wireless access, and mmW backhaul. Furthermore, highly integrated and complex designs demanded by 5G will require closer coordination between the ecosystem of component vendors, OEMs and Chipset Vendors, a key strength of ours.
 In the United States we have a strong position with service providers and carriers that supply in-home residential wireless equipment. That said, we believe there are growth opportunities on the international front. This includes Europe, especially in areas of the connected home and automotive OEM markets will offer meaningful opportunities.

Generally, ODM customers do not own all of the rights to the design and engineering assets of the products they produce and deliver. Historically, ODMs have been thought to focus primarily on cost; however, our ODM customers also emphasize performance and design flexibility when working on antenna selection and placement.

• | Chipset Vendors. We sell small quantities of our products directly to chipset vendors for their reference designs. Through our close working relationships with the leading chipset makers for the WLAN we have developed a significant level of expertise in the testing and evaluation of chipset reference designs and systems. Chipset vendors and Semiconductor manufacturers work with us to promote better integration and improved performance, and to create optimal reference designs. These customers help influence purchasing decisions with OEM and ODMs as their reference designs and associated Bills of Materials (BoM’s) and suppliers are usually closely replicated in production designs. This can also improve time-to-market for OEM and ODM customers.

• | Service Providers. We do not sell antennas directly to telecommunications and broadband service providers, but these companies often specify overall product performance, and sometimes use our wireless test and validation services. By working with the service providers, we are often written into the carrier’s specifications, which are sent to the OEM or ODM. Our antenna products are then shipped directly from our contract manufacturers to the device manufacturer. In doing so, we can have an impact on an OEM’s or ODM’s ability to hit certain performance levels. We have worked with service providers, and in some cases, we have sold testing equipment that mirrors the testing equipment and environment we use internally.

Sales and Marketing
 Our sales and marketing organizations work together closely to improve market awareness, build a strong sales pipeline, and cultivate ongoing customer relationships to drive sales growth.
Sales
 We sell our products to OEMs, ODMs, carriers and through manufactures for retail. Our global sales effort consists of direct and indirect sales teams, and indirect channel partners. Our direct sales team consists of inside sales personnel based in China and Taiwan and our outside field sales teams based in United States, Europe, Korea, China, and Taiwan. Our outside field sales teams consist of business, sales, account, technical marketing and program managers, and field application engineers, or FAEs. Our indirect channel partners consist of distributors, engineering design companies and outside sales representatives.
 Our outside sales team is engaged in pre-sales, account management, and creating partnership opportunities with third parties such as service providers and semiconductor manufacturers. They are assigned quotas and have defined sales territories and/or accounts. The sales process includes meeting and qualifying potential programs and customers, and actively managing the planning stage of devices they plan to bring to market.  Our FAEs assist these managers by providing technical support to existing customers.
 Our indirect channel partners provide lead generation, pre-sales support, product fulfillment and, in certain circumstances, post-sales customer service and support. This channel partner network often co-sells with our inside sales and field sales teams. Our channel provides us with additional sales leverage by sourcing new prospects, providing technical support to existing customers, upselling for additional use cases and daily indexing capacities, and maintaining repeat business with existing customers. These channels provide added coverage to customers and prospects we cannot reach directly. The percentage of our sales from indirect channel partners was 27%, 24% and 23% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  
 Marketing
 Our marketing strategy is focused on building market awareness and acceptance of our products, and promoting our brand. We market our products directly to both prospective and existing customers. The marketing department is engaged in product management, product marketing, program management, corporate marketing, tradeshows and public speaking, development of our website and collateral material, and creating partnership opportunities with third parties, such as service providers and semiconductor manufacturers. Marketing emphasizes our competitive strengths and provides input into the future direction of product development and customer profiles.
 Our primary marketing initiatives include trade shows, industry events, industry reputation, and publications, including white papers and trade journals. We strategically choose the location and focus of each trade show based on each show’s prospectus, reputation, and audience attendees, allocating marketing funds to support shows annually in North America, Asia, and Europe. These shows provide us with the opportunity to showcase our newest products and system designs, as well as set up meetings with current and potential OEM and ODM customers, carriers, and chipset manufacturers.
 Competition
 The embedded and external antenna market is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving standards. Our principal competitors fall into three categories:

• | Direct competitors. Direct competitors include independent antenna companies, 2J Antennas USA Corp., Adant Technologies Inc., Asian Creation Communications Factory, AVX Corporation, Fractus S.A., Baylin Technologies Inc., Honglin Technology Group Ltd., Laird PLC, Mobile Mark, Inc.,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12

 
PCTEL, Inc., Pinyon Technologies Inc., Sunwave Communications Co., Ltd., Taoglas Limited, Wanshih Electronic Co. Ltd., and WHA YU Industrial Co., Ltd., among others. In addition, the barriers to entry for the antenna industry are low, and we expect new competitors to emerge in the future.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In-house Antenna Design and Engineering Teams. Several of our existing customers, including ODMs which design and build complete wireless devices, also have internal resources to design, engineer, and produce antenna solutions. In such cases, we compete against the captive resource of that ODM. Several ODMs, including Arcadyan Technology Corporation, Foxconn Electronics Inc., Gemtek Technology Co. Ltd., and Wistron Corporation, design, manufacture, and sell antennas, in direct competition with us.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Third-Party Custom Design and Engineering Companies. Some of our existing customers and prospects use outsourced engineering services to provide antenna solutions. In these cases, there may be short-term or long-term contractors who work to design, engineer, test, and manage production of an antenna solution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The principal competitive factors in our markets include:
  
• | Price and total cost of ownership as a result of reliability and performance issues;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Brand awareness and reputation;
--+--------------------------------


• | Antenna performance, such as reliability, range, throughput;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Offerings across breadth of in-home wireless products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | Antenna design and testing capabilities;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Relationships with semiconductor/chipset vendors; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Intellectual property portfolio.
--+---------------------------------

 We compete primarily based on antenna performance, our intellectual product portfolio, design and testing capabilities, and reputation. We believe we generally compete favorably on the basis of these factors. However, some of our existing and potential competitors may have advantages over us. Many of our competitors are significantly larger in scale than we are and have access to greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources. In most instances, competition among these vendors creates some level of pricing pressure and forces us to lower prices below our established list prices. Many direct competitors compete based upon price, and some high-volume Asia-based competitors are prepared to operate at less than 20% gross product margins.
 Manufacturing and Operations
 We have limited manufacturing capability, solely with respect to antennas deployed in the fleet and M2M market. We do final assembly of these antenna products at our facility located in Scottsdale, Arizona, where we purchase raw materials, assemble, test, and ship products. We outsource the manufacturing for all of our other products to two principal contract manufacturers, or CMs, located in China. We work with these CMs to purchase raw materials, assemble, test, and ship our antenna products. We perform quality assurance and testing at our California facilities.
 We maintain a close direct relationship with these manufacturers to help ensure supply and quality meet our requirements. Although the contract manufacturing services required to manufacture and assemble our products can be satisfied by one of our CMs or may be readily available from several established manufacturers, it may be time consuming and costly to qualify and implement new contract manufacturer relationships. If our CMs suffer an interruption in their businesses, or experiences delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations, or we otherwise have to change or add additional contract manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed, and our business adversely affected. The CMs manufacture antenna products according to our design specification, materials specification, quality standards, and delivery requirements. We have full control and authority over the selection of materials, manufacturing processes, and inspection processes.

Research and Development
 We invest considerable time and financial resources in research and development to enhance our antenna design and system integration capabilities and conduct quality assurance testing to improve our technology. Our engineering team consists of engineers located in research, design, and test centers in California, the United Kingdom, China, and Taiwan. Our engineering team actively participates in research and development activities to expand our capabilities and target applications for the Consumer, Enterprise and Automotive markets. We expect to continue to expand our product offerings and technology solutions in the future and to invest significantly in ongoing research and development efforts.
 In the connected home, we are developing a series of antenna products for the home security market, including designs ranging from Z-Wave applications for door sensors to customized connectivity solutions for smart metering using LTE and LPWAN standards, and near field antenna modules enabling gigabit speed last meter connectivity for broadband operators.  We continue to architect and improve our antenna systems for our enterprise class smart antenna customers, as well as new high performance designs for the outdoor Wi-Fi and small cell markets. We continually review alternative antenna designs for increasingly complex carrier gateway products, which are expanding beyond just delivering Wi-Fi to also include 5G, ZigBee, Z-Wave, DECT, LPWAN, NB-IoT and Bluetooth applications. Finally, we are engaged in the design and evaluation of antenna systems for next generation 802.11ax technology, including reference designs with industry leading chipset vendors.
 Seasonality
 Our operating results historically have not been subject to significant seasonal variations. However, our operating results are affected by how customers make purchasing decisions around local holidays in China. For example, a national holiday the first week of October in China may cause customers to purchase product in the third quarter ahead of their holiday season to account for higher volume requirements in the fourth quarter. In addition, although it is difficult to make broad generalizations, our sales tend to be lower in the first quarter of each year compared to other quarters due to the Chinese New Year. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year and these patterns may change as a result of general customer demand or product cycles.
Intellectual Property
 We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our technology. As of December 31, 2018, we had 175 issued U.S. patents covering our embedded and external antenna technology with expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2033, and 46 patent applications pending for examination in the United States. We also have 24 issued patents and 3 pending patent applications for examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions (Europe, China and Japan) with expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2037, which entail counterparts of U.S. utility patent applications. The patents consist of several broad areas, as summarized by the following four patent groups:

• | Methods of determining which antenna pattern to use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Antenna pattern selection with multiple stations connected to access point;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Dynamically selected antennas for MIMO systems; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Hardware implementations of switched directional antennas.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 Taken together, these patents with priority dates as far back as November 2000, form both a barrier to competition and a licensable asset for customers in the MIMO arena.
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary 
 14

rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.
 Our industry is characterized by the existence of many patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the technology industry have extensive patent portfolios. Third parties, including certain of these leading companies, may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our customers.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 86 employees in the United States, 4 in the United Kingdom and 28 in China. Among the total 118 employees, 48 of them were primarily engaged in research and development, 24 of them were primarily engaged in sales and marketing and 46 of them were primarily engaged in operations and general and administration functions. In addition, we contract directly with engineers and sales contractors domestically and internationally. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
