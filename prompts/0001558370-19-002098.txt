Item 1. Business. Company Overview
 Merchants Bancorp (the “Company,” “Merchants,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), an Indiana corporation formed in 2006, is a diversified bank holding company headquartered in Carmel, Indiana and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. We currently operate multiple lines of business, including multi‑family housing and healthcare facility financing and servicing, mortgage warehouse financing, retail and correspondent residential mortgage banking, agricultural lending and traditional community banking. As of December 31, 2018, we had $3.9 billion in assets, $3.2 billion of deposits and $421.2 million of shareholders’ equity.
 We were founded in 1990 as a mortgage banking company, providing financing for multi‑family housing and senior living properties. The shared vision of our founders, Michael Petrie and Randall Rogers, was to create a diversified financial services company, which efficiently operates both nationally through mortgage banking and related services and locally through a community bank. We have grown both organically and through acquisitions focused on expanding our services. We have strategically built our business in a way that we believe offers insulation from cyclical economic and credit swings and provides synergies across our lines of business.
 Merchants Bank of Indiana (“Merchants Bank”), one of our wholly-owned banking subsidiaries, operates under an Indiana charter and provides traditional community banking services, as well as retail and correspondent residential mortgage banking and agricultural lending. Merchants Bank has four depository branches located in Carmel, Indianapolis, and Lynn, Indiana. Farmers-Merchants Bank of Illinois (“FMBI”, formerly named Joy State Bank), another wholly-owned banking subsidiary, acquired on January 2, 2018, operates under an Illinois charter and provides traditional community banking services and agricultural lending. Prior to its acquisition of Farmers-Merchants National Bank of Paxton (“FMNBP”) on October 1, 2018, FMBI had two depository branches, with one located in Joy, Illinois and the other located in New Boston, Illinois. FMBI’s acquisition of FMNBP, which operated under a national charter and also provided traditional community banking services and agricultural lending, added three new depository branches, located in Paxton, Melvin, and Piper City, Illinois.
 Our Business Segments 
 We have several lines of business and provide various banking and financial services through our subsidiaries.  Our business segments are defined as multi-family mortgage banking, mortgage warehousing, and banking.  Multi-Family Mortgage Banking
 Merchants Capital Corp. (“MCC”, formerly P/R Mortgage and Investment Corp.) and Merchants Capital Servicing, LLC (“MCS”, formerly RICHMAC Funding, LLC), subsidiaries of Merchants Bank, are primarily engaged in mortgage banking, specializing in originating and servicing loans for multi‑family rental housing and healthcare facility financing. In August 2017, MCC acquired MCS, a national multi‑family housing mortgage lender, to complement and expand the products and services offered by MCC.  Through the MCS acquisition, MCC gained the ability to originate and service Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) Affordable multi-family products. 
 Through the Multi-Family Mortgage Banking segment, we primarily originate FHA loans that are sold as Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) mortgage backed securities within approximately 30 days.

The Company also originates loans sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae as mortgage backed securities. The loans are sold and servicing rights are retained. Other originations include bridge and permanent financing that are referred to the Banking segment. These loans eventually become permanent financings. In addition to the loans originated directly through Multi-Family Mortgage Banking, we also fund loans brought to us by non‑affiliated entities and service or sub-service loans for a fee. 
 The segment’s primary source of funding is the national secondary mortgage market. Investors in the market are large financial institutions, brokerage companies, insurance companies and real estate investment trusts. MCC is an approved FHA lender and a Ginnie Mae issuer of mortgage backed securities. It is also an approved Multi-family Accelerated Processing and Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) section 232 LEAN lender and a Rural Housing Service (“RHS”) approved lender for their Section 538 program. MCC is an approved Freddie Mac Targeted Affordable Lender and Fannie Mae Affordable Lender. These programs facilitate secondary market activities in order to provide funding for the multi‑family mortgage market.
 Multi-Family Mortgage Banking funds loans through the sale of participation interests to Merchants Bank, where they accrue interest for approximately 30 days before delivery to the end investor. Generally, these loans have 35-year fixed rates with 10 year call protection. The loans are predominantly insured by the FHA and RHS are rate locked as forward delivery Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities, who guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest to investors. 
 Mortgage Warehousing
 Merchants Bank started our warehouse lending business in 2009 as a result of dislocation in the market. Merchants Bank currently has warehouse lines of credit and loan participations with some of the largest non‑depository financial institutions and mortgage bankers in the country. 
 Under its warehouse program, Merchants Bank provides warehouse financing arrangements to lenders for the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans. Merchants Bank structures its funding primarily as a loan participation and also offers secured lines of credit. Agency eligible (Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), governmental (FHA insured or Veterans Affairs (“VA”) or United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) guaranteed), and jumbo residential mortgage loans that are secured by mortgages placed on single and multi-family properties may be purchased and placed on each mortgage warehouse line.
 Through Natty Mac Funding, Inc. (“NMF”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merchants Bank, we have engaged in loan participations and warehouse financing with Home Point Financial Corporation (“Home Point”) and its subsidiaries and correspondent customers during 2018. We entered into a Revolving Loan and Subordinated Loan Agreement whereby Home Point invested $30 million in our subordinated debt.  In turn, we invested the proceeds into Merchants Bank and then to NMF. NMF provided $300 million of lending capacity to Home Point and its subsidiaries and correspondent customers. We earned net interest income and used Home Point custodial deposits to fund the loans. However, on December 31, 2018 the Company acquired the assets of NattyMac, LLC from Home Point and terminated their warehouse funding arrangement.  Additionally, the $30 million subordinated debt and related interest was repaid by the Company. 
 In 2018, we entered into an arrangement similar to that between NMF and Home Point with another warehouse customer and may do so with additional mortgage warehouse customers in the future.
 Banking
 Commercial Lending and Retail Banking
 Merchants Bank holds loans in its portfolio comprised of multi‑family construction and bridge loans referred by MCC, owner occupied commercial real estate loans, commercial & industrial loans, agricultural loans, residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Merchants Bank receives deposits from customers located primarily in Hamilton, Marion, Randolph and surrounding counties in Indiana and from the escrows generated by the servicing activities of MCC and MCS. FMBI receives deposits from customers located through multiple branches in Illinois.

 Agricultural Lending
 Merchants Bank’s Lynn office, located in Lynn, Randolph County, Indiana, primarily provides agricultural loans within its designated Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) area of Randolph and Wayne counties in Eastern Indiana and nearby Darke County, Ohio. FMBI primarily provides agricultural loans within its designated CRA area of Mercer County in Western Illinois and with the acquisition of FMNBP, in Ford County in East Central Illinois.  Merchants Bank and FMBI offer operating lines of credit for crop and livestock production, intermediate term financing to purchase agricultural equipment and breeding livestock and long‑term financing to purchase agricultural real estate. Merchants Bank is approved to sell agricultural loans in the secondary market through the Farmer Mac and uses this relationship to manage interest rate risk within the agricultural loan portfolio.  Single Family Mortgage Lending, Correspondent Lending and Servicing
 Merchants Mortgage is the branded arm and division of Merchants Bank that is a full service single‑family mortgage origination and servicing platform that we launched in February 2013. Merchants Mortgage is both a retail and correspondent mortgage lender. Merchants Mortgage offers agency eligible, jumbo fixed and hybrid adjustable rate mortgages for purchase or refinancing of single‑family residences. Other products include construction, bridge and lot financing, and first-lien home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”). Merchants Mortgage generates revenues from fees charged to borrowers, interest income during the warehouse period, and gain on sale of loans to investors. There are multiple investor outlets, including direct sale capability to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Indianapolis and Chicago, and other third-party investors to allow Merchants Mortgage a best execution at sale. Merchants Mortgage also originates loans held for investment and earns interest income over the life of the loan.

SBA Lending
 Merchants Bank participates in the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) 7(a) program in order to meet the needs of our small business community, and help diversify our retail revenue stream. In January of 2018, Merchants Bank was awarded Preferred Lender Program (“PLP”) status, the SBA’s highest level of approval that a lender can hold. This designation provides us delegated loan approval, closing and servicing authority that enables loan decisions to be made more rapidly.
 See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 24, “Segment Information,” in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our segments. 
 Competition
 We compete in a number of areas, including commercial and retail banking, residential mortgages, and multi‑family FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac affordable loan originations in the multi‑family and health care sectors. These industries are highly competitive, and the Company faces strong direct competition for deposits, loans, and FHA loan originations and other financial‑related services. We compete with other non-depository financial institutions and community banks, thrifts and credit unions. Although some of these competitors are situated locally, others have statewide or regional presence. In addition, we compete with large banks and other financial intermediaries, such as consumer finance companies, brokerage firms, mortgage banking companies, business leasing and finance companies, insurance companies, multi-family loan origination businesses, securities firms, mutual funds and certain government agencies as well as major retailers, all actively engaged in providing various types of loans and other financial services. Additionally, we face growing competition from online businesses with few or no physical locations, including online banks, lenders and consumer and commercial lending platforms, as well as automated retirement and investment service providers. We believe that the range and quality of products that we offer, the knowledge of our personnel and our emphasis on building long‑lasting relationships sets us apart from our competitors. Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 259 employees. The Company has been named to the list of “Best Places to Work in Indiana” by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce every year since 2016. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with employees are positive.

 Corporate Information
 Our principal executive offices are located at 11555 North Meridian Street, Suite 400, Carmel, Indiana 46032, and our telephone number at that address is (317) 569‑7420. Through our website at www.merchantsbankofindiana.com under “Investors,” we make available, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as well as proxy statements, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Those filings can also be obtained on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The information contained on our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this report.     SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 General
 Insured banks, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (“IDFI”), Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (“IDFPR”), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Furthermore, tax laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), anti‑money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) and mortgage related rules, including with respect to loan securitization and servicing by HUD and agencies such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and rules are significant to our operations and results, and the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty.
 Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of financial institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC‑insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than their shareholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the payment of dividends.
 This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that, while not publicly available, can impact the conduct and growth of their businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies.
 The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to us. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.

 Merchants Bancorp
 Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
 We, as the sole shareholder of Merchants Bank and FMBI, are a bank holding company (“BHC”) within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). As a BHC, we are subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of Federal Reserve. The BHC Act requires a BHC to file an annual report of its operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. Acquisition of Banks
 Generally, the BHC Act governs the acquisition and control of banks and nonbanking companies by BHCs.
 A BHC’s acquisition of 5% or more of the voting shares of any other bank or BHC generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve and is subject to applicable federal and state law. The Federal Reserve evaluates acquisition applications based on, among other things, competitive factors, supervisory factors, adequacy of financial and managerial resources, and banking and community needs considerations.
 The BHC Act also prohibits, with certain exceptions, a BHC from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any “nonbanking” company unless the Federal Reserve finds the nonbanking activities be “so closely related to banking . . . as to be a proper incident thereto” or another exception applies. The BHC Act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of a BHC or its nonbank subsidiaries.
 The BHC Act and Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, prohibit acquisition of “control” of a bank or BHC without prior notice to certain federal bank regulators. The BHC Act defines “control,” in certain cases, as the acquisition of as little as 10% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting stock. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, a BHC may not be able to purchase its own shares where the gross consideration will equal 10% or more of the Company’s net worth, without obtaining approval of the Federal Reserve.
 The Federal Reserve Act subjects banks and their affiliates to certain requirements and restrictions when dealing with each other (affiliate transactions include transactions between a bank and its BHC).
 Permitted Activities
 Under the BHC Act, a BHC and its nonbank subsidiaries are generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of the voting shares of companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking, including:
 •factoring accounts receivable;
 •making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities in connection with the foregoing;
 •leasing personal or real property under certain conditions;
 •operating a non‑bank depository institution, such as a savings association;
 •engaging in trust company functions in a manner authorized by state law;
 •financial and investment advisory activities;
 •discount securities brokerage activities;
 •underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments;
 •providing specified management consulting and counseling activities;

 
  7

 

 •performing selected data processing services and support services;
 •acting as an agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and
 •performing selected insurance underwriting activities.
 The Federal Reserve may order a BHC or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the BHC’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries. A qualifying BHC that elects to be treated as a financial holding company may also engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of the voting shares of companies engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or are complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of the institution or the financial system generally. We have not elected, and presently do not intend to elect, to be treated as a financial holding company.
 Support of Subsidiary Institutions
 The Federal Reserve has issued regulations under the BHC Act requiring a BHC to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. Pursuant to such regulations a BHC should stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity.
 Repurchase or Redemption of Shares
 A BHC is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its own then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well‑capitalized BHCs that meet certain conditions.
 Merchants Bank and FMBI
 Merchants Bank is an Indiana chartered, non-Federal Reserve member bank subject to supervision and regulation by the FDIC and IDFI. FMBI is an Illinois chartered, non-Federal Reserve member bank subject to supervision and regulation by the FDIC and IDFPR.
 Bank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act
 The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), enacted as the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, requires financial institutions to maintain records of certain customers and currency transactions and to report certain domestic and foreign currency transactions, which may have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings. This law requires financial institutions to develop a BSA compliance program.
 The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“Patriot Act”), is comprehensive anti‑terrorism legislation. Title III of the Patriot Act requires financial institutions to help prevent and detect international money laundering and the financing of terrorism and prosecute those involved in such activities. The Treasury has adopted additional requirements to further implement Title III.
 These regulations have established a mechanism for law enforcement officials to communicate names of suspected terrorists and money launderers to financial institutions, enabling financial institutions to promptly locate accounts and transactions involving those suspects. Financial institutions receiving names of suspects must search their account and transaction records for potential matches and report positive results to the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”). Each financial institution must designate a point of contact to receive information

requests. These regulations outline how financial institutions can share information concerning suspected terrorist and money laundering activity with other financial institutions under the protection of a statutory safe harbor if each financial institution notifies FinCEN of its intent to share information. The Treasury has also adopted regulations to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing through correspondent accounts that U.S. financial institutions maintain on behalf of foreign banks. These regulations also require financial institutions to take reasonable steps to ensure that they are not providing banking services directly or indirectly to foreign shell banks. In addition, banks must have procedures to verify the identity of their customers.
 Merchants Bank and FMBI established an anti‑money laundering program pursuant to the BSA and a customer identification program pursuant to the Patriot Act. Merchants Bank and FMBI also maintain records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, file reports of certain cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and reports suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities pursuant to the BSA. Merchants Bank and FMBI otherwise have implemented policies and procedures to comply with the foregoing requirements.
 FDIC Improvement Act of 1991
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require, among other things, federal bank regulatory authorities to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks which do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDICIA established five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA.
 “Undercapitalized” banks are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The bank’s BHC is required to guarantee that the bank will comply with the plan and provide appropriate assurances of performance. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. “Significantly undercapitalized” banks are subject to one or more restrictions, including an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, and restrictions on compensation of executive officers. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions may not, beginning 60 days after becoming “critically undercapitalized,” make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt or extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction or enter into any transaction outside the ordinary course of business. In addition, “critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator. Any bank that is not “well capitalized” is subject to limitations, and a prohibition in the case of any bank that is “undercapitalized,” on the acceptance, renewal, or roll over of any brokered deposit.
 Currently, a “well capitalized” institution is one that has a total risk‑based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%, a common equity Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and is not subject to regulatory direction to maintain a specific level for any capital measure. An “adequately capitalized” institution is one that has ratios of at least 8%, 6%, 4% and 4.5%, respectively. An institution is “undercapitalized” if any of its respective ratios is less than 8%, 6%, 4% and 4.5%, as applicable. “Significantly undercapitalized” institutions have ratios of less than 6%, 4%, 3% and 3%, respectively. An institution is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is 2% or less.
 At December 31, 2018, Merchants Bank and FMBI were well capitalized, as defined by the FDICIA and applicable FDIC regulations.
 Deposit Insurance Fund and Financing Corporation Assessments
 The Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC insures the deposits of Merchants Bank and FMBI up to $250,000 per depositor, qualifying joint accounts, and certain other accounts. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd‑Frank Act”) requires the FDIC to set a DIF reserve ratio of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits, which the FDIC achieved on September 30, 2018 and as a result, we expect to receive assessment credits for the portion of our assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15 percent and 1.35 percent, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38 percent.

 The FDIC’s risk‑based assessment system requires insured institutions to pay deposit insurance premiums based on the risk that each institution poses to the DIF. The FDIC recently changed the methodology for determining assessment rates. Through the second quarter of 2016, the FDIC assigned each insured depository institution to one of four risk categories based on the institution’s regulatory capital levels, supervisory evaluations, and certain other factors. The institution’s risk category determines its assessment rate. Certain factors, such as brokered deposits in excess of a certain ceiling, could result in adjustments to an assessment rate. The rate is applied to the institution’s total average consolidated assets during the assessment period less average tangible equity (i.e., Tier 1 capital).
 Beginning in the third quarter of 2016, which was the first quarter after the quarter the DIF reserve ratio exceeded 1.15%, a new assessment regulation took effect for banks with less than $10.0 billion in assets and that have been FDIC‑insured for at least five years, such as Merchants Bank and FMBI. The rule replaced the four risk categories with a financial ratios method based on a statistical model estimating the insured depository institution’s probability of failure over three years. The rule eliminates the adjustment factor for brokered deposits; lowered the range of assessment rates authorized to 0.015% per annum for an institution posing the least risk, to 0.40% per annum for an institution posing the most risk; and furthered lower the range of assessment rates if the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increases to 2% or more.
 In addition to its risk‑based insurance assessments, the FDIC also imposes assessments to help make $780 million in annual interest payments on approximately $8 billion of bonds issued in the late 1980s by a government corporation, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”), to help finance the recovery of the thrift industry from the savings and loan crisis. Merchants Bank’s FICO assessment for the first quarter of 2018 was equal to .00110%, for the second and third quarters of 2018 was .00080%, and for the fourth quarter of 2018 was .00035%, per $100 of assessment base. FICO assessments will continue until all outstanding bonds mature in 2019. 
 Dividends
 We are a legal entity separate and distinct from Merchants Bank and FMBI. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which Merchants Bank or FMBI can supply funds to us. Our principal source of funds consists of dividends from Merchants Bank. State and federal law restrict the amount of dividends that banks may pay to its shareholders or BHC. The specific limits depend on a number of factors, including the bank’s type of charter, recent earnings, recent dividends, level of capital and regulatory status. The regulators are authorized, and under certain circumstances are required, to prohibit the payment of dividends or other distributions if the regulators determine that making such payments would be an unsafe or unsound practice. For example, the FDICIA generally prohibits an insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its BHC if the distribution would cause the bank to become undercapitalized.
 In addition, under Indiana law, Merchants Bank must obtain the approval of the IDFI prior to the payment of any dividend if the total of all dividends declared by Merchants Bank during the calendar year, including any proposed dividend, would exceed the sum of its net income for the year to date combined with its retained net income for the previous two years.
 As of 2016, the capital regulations began to limit a depository institution’s ability to make capital distributions if it does not hold a specified capital conservation buffer above the required minimum risk‑based capital ratios. There is a phase‑in period that began in 2016 and concludes in 2019 with a buffer requirement of 2.5%. For 2018, the requirement was 1.875%. Regulators also review and limit proposed dividend payments as part of the supervisory process and review of an institution’s capital planning. In addition to dividend limitations, Merchants Bank and FMBI are subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to us, on investments in our shares or other securities and in taking such shares or securities as collateral for loans.
 Community Reinvestment Act
 The CRA requires that the federal banking regulators evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. Regulators also consider these factors in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in the imposition of additional requirements and limitations on Merchants Bank and FMBI.

 Capital Requirements and Basel III
 Apart from the capital levels for insured depository institutions that were established by the FDICIA for the prompt corrective action regime discussed above, the federal regulators have issued rules that impose minimum capital requirements on both insured depository institutions and their holding companies (with the exception of BHCs with less than $1 billion in pro forma consolidated assets and that meet other prerequisites). Although the rules contain certain standards applicable only to large, internationally active banks, many of them apply to all banking organizations, including us, Merchants Bank, and FMBI. The institutions and companies subject to the rules are referred to collectively herein as “covered” banking organizations. By virtue of a provision in the Dodd‑Frank Act known as the Collins Amendment, the requirements must be the same at both the institution level and the holding company level. The minimum capital rules have undergone several revisions over the years. The current requirements, which began to take effect in 2015, are based on the international Basel III capital framework. These requirements apply to all covered banking organizations (including us) with some requirements phasing in over time. However, on November 21, 2017, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), and FDIC finalized a joint proposal and adopted a final rule (the “Transitions Rule”) pursuant to which the regulatory capital treatment then in place for mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”), certain temporary difference deferred tax assets, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions was indefinitely extended, while a separately proposed rule to simplify the regulatory capital treatment of such items is considered by such regulators (the “Simplification NPR”). The extension of the capital rules with respect to MSRs is the only portion of the Transitions Rule that was material to the us. If the Transitions Rule had not been enacted, beginning January 1, 2018, we would have been required to make certain additional deductions and increases to its risk-weighting for the purposes of our capital calculations, which would have resulted in the us reporting a lower amount of capital. As a result of the Transitions Rule, there will be no such adjustments to our capital. 
 The minimum capital requirements for all covered banking organizations (including holding companies) are the same as the “adequately capitalized” standards in the prompt corrective action regime: a common equity tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of 4.5%, a tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of 6%, a total risk‑based capital ratio of 8%, and a leverage ratio of 4%. Other requirements that apply to us and Merchants Bank are phasing in, including the following provisions that:
 •limit to 10% of a bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital each of the MSRs, certain temporary difference deferred tax assets, and significant investments in the common stock of certain unconsolidated banking, financial and insurance entities (“unconsolidated financial institutions”). If any of these components exceeds the 10% threshold, the excess amount must be deducted from common equity;
 •set a cumulative limit on MSRs, certain temporary difference deferred tax assets, and significant investments in the common stock of certain unconsolidated financial institutions of 15% of a bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital. If these combined components exceed the 15% threshold, the surplus amount must be deducted from common equity;
 •require that 80% of the amount of non‑significant investments in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution above the 10% threshold be deducted, and that significant investments in the capital stock of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common stock be deducted from regulatory capital in their entirety by applying the corresponding deduction approach;
 •set a new additional capital conservation buffer discussed above under Dividends of 2.5% of risk‑weighted assets over each of the required risk‑based capital ratios that must be met to avoid limitations in the ability of a bank to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses; and
 •raise the risk‑weights of certain assets for purposes of calculating the risk‑based capital ratios for high volatility commercial real estate (“HVCRE”) acquisition, development and construction (“ADC”) loans, certain past due non‑residential mortgage loans and certain mortgage‑backed and other securities exposures.
 As of December 31, 2018, the Simplification NPR had not been finalized.  If the Simplification NPR is finalized in the form proposed, it would change the capital treatment of MSRs, temporary difference deferred tax assets, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions by (i) lifting the threshold at which any amount of these asset classes individually must be deducted from common equity Tier 1 capital from 10% to 25% of such capital 

 
  11

 
and (ii) for investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that are not deducted from common equity Tier 1 capital, replacing the 250% risk weight with the relevant risk weight for the exposure category of the investment. The 250% risk weight would continue to apply to non‑deducted MSRs and temporary difference deferred tax assets. The Simplification NPR would eliminate (i) the aggregate 15% deduction threshold that applies collectively to MSRs, temporary difference deferred tax assets, and significant investments in the common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions; (ii) the 10% common equity Tier 1 capital deduction threshold for non‑significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions; (iii) the deduction treatment for significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common stock; and (iv) the distinct treatments for significant and non‑significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions.
 The Simplification NPR also would revise the standardized risk‑based capital rules by replacing the exposure category of HVCRE loans, which are risk‑weighted at 150%, with a new category of high volatility acquisition, development or construction (“HVADC”) loans, which would be risk‑weighted at 130%. The definition of HVADC is intended to simplify and clarify the current definition of HVCRE loans. The regulators expect that, in the aggregate, the new definition would capture more loans than does the current definition.
 In addition to modifications of the new capital rules, the Simplification NPR also would replace the current rules for the inclusion of minority interests in capital with a rule that would allow a non‑advance approaches banking organization to include common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total capital minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries up to and including 10% of the organization’s common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total capital (before the inclusion of any minority interest), respectively.
 The capital treatment of the Transition will remain in effect until the Simplification NPR is finalized and becomes effective or until the Transitions NPR is otherwise superseded.
 In May 2018, Congress enacted the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“Regulatory Relief Act”) and, among other provisions, Section 201 thereof instructed the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (“CBLR”) of between 8 and 10%. On February 8, 2019, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC published a proposed rule setting the CBLR at 9% of tangible equity to total assets for a qualifying bank to be well capitalized (the “CBLR NPR”). Under the CBLR NPR, a community banking organization would be eligible to elect the new framework if it has less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a CBLR greater than 9%. The electing institution would not be required to calculate the existing risk-based and leverage capital requirements of the Basel III framework described above and would not need to risk-weight its assets for purposes of capital calculations.
     We are in the process of considering the CBLR NPR and will await any final regulation to determine whether we are eligible or will elect to follow such framework.
     The Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 On July 21, 2010, the Dodd‑Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd‑Frank Act represented a sweeping reform of the U.S. supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions and capital markets in the wake of the global financial crisis, certain aspects of which are described below in more detail. In particular, and among other things, the Dodd‑Frank Act: (i) created a Financial Stability Oversight Council as part of a regulatory structure for identifying emerging systemic risks and improving interagency cooperation; (ii) created the CFPB, which is authorized to regulate providers of consumer credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services; (iii) narrowed the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws enjoyed by national banks and federal savings associations and expanded the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation; (iv) imposed more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies and subjected certain activities, including interstate mergers and acquisitions, to heightened capital conditions; (v) with respect to mortgage lending, (a) significantly expanded requirements applicable to loans secured by 1‑4 family residential real property, (b) imposed strict rules on mortgage servicing, and (c) required the originator of a securitized loan, or the sponsor of a securitization, to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of securitized exposures unless the underlying exposures are qualified residential mortgages or meet certain underwriting standards; (vi) repealed the prohibition on the payment of interest on business checking accounts; (vii) restricted the interchange fees payable on debit card transactions for issuers with $10 billion in assets or greater; (viii) in the so‑called “Volcker Rule,” subject to numerous exceptions, prohibited depository 

 
  12

 
institutions and affiliates from certain investments in, and sponsorship of, hedge funds and private equity funds and from engaging in proprietary trading; (ix) provided for enhanced regulation of advisers to private funds and of the derivatives markets; (x) enhanced oversight of credit rating agencies; and (xi) prohibited banking agency requirements tied to credit ratings. These statutory changes shifted the regulatory framework for financial institutions, impacted the way in which they do business and have the potential to constrain revenues.
 Numerous provisions of the Dodd‑Frank Act were required to be implemented through rulemaking by the appropriate federal regulatory agencies. Many of the required regulations have been issued and others have been released for public comment, but are not final. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence is expected to filter down in varying degrees to smaller institutions over time.
 Privacy and Cybersecurity

Merchants Bank and FMBI are subject to many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect non-public confidential information of their customers. These laws require banks to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and permitting customers to opt out of their ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. They also impact a bank’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. In addition, banks are required to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. These security and privacy policies and procedures, for the protection of personal and confidential information, are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations. Consumer Financial Services
 The structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB commenced operations to oversee and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including Merchants Bank, as well as the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over insured depository institutions and their holding companies with more than $10 billion in assets. (The CFPB has similar authority over certain nonbanking organizations.) Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like Merchants Bank and FMBI, will continue to be examined by their primary federal regulators, which can be expected to nonetheless look to the rulings and enforcements actions of the CFPB as they carry out their supervision of larger institutions.
 Because abuses in connection with residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the financial crisis, many new rules issued by the CFPB and required by the Dodd‑Frank Act address mortgage and mortgage‑related products, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd‑Frank Act significantly expanded underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1‑4 family residential real property and augmented federal law combating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd‑Frank Act imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks and savings associations, in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower’s ability to repay, while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain “qualified mortgages.” In addition, the Dodd‑Frank Act generally required lenders or securitizers to retain an economic interest in the credit risk relating to loans that the lender sells, and other asset‑backed securities that the securitizer issues, if the loans do not comply with the ability‑to‑repay standards described below. The risk retention requirement generally is 5%, but could be increased or decreased by regulation. Merchants Bank does not currently expect the CFPB’s rules to have a significant impact on its operations, except for higher compliance costs.
 S.A.F.E. Act
 Regulations issued under the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (the “S.A.F.E. Act”) require residential mortgage loan originators who are employees of institutions regulated by the foregoing agencies, including national banks, to meet the registration requirements of the S.A.F.E. Act. The S.A.F.E. Act requires residential mortgage loan originators who are employees of regulated financial institutions to register with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, a database created by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors 

 
  13

 
and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators to support the licensing of mortgage loan originators by the states. The S.A.F.E. Act generally prohibits employees of regulated financial institutions from originating residential mortgage loans unless they obtain and annually maintain registration as a registered mortgage loan originator.
 Mortgage Origination
 On January 10, 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule implementing the “ability to repay” requirement in the Dodd‑Frank Act. This rule, among other things, requires lenders to consider a consumer’s ability to repay a mortgage loan before extending credit to the consumer, and limits prepayment penalties. The rule also establishes certain protections from liability for mortgage lenders with regard to the “qualified mortgages” they originate. This rule includes within the definition of a “qualified mortgage” a loan with a borrower debt‑to‑income ratio of less than or equal to 43% or, alternatively, a loan eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while they operate under federal conservatorship or receivership, and loans eligible for insurance or guarantee by the FHA, VA or USDA. Additionally, a qualified mortgage may not: (i) contain excess upfront points and fees; (ii) have a term greater than 30 years; or (iii) include interest−only or negative amortization payments. This rule became effective January 10, 2014, and it has not had a significant impact on our mortgage production operations since most of the loans Merchants Bank currently originates would constitute “qualified mortgages” under the rule. Mortgage Servicing
 On January 17, 2013, the CFPB issued a series of final rules as part of an ongoing effort to address mortgage servicing reforms and create uniform standards for the mortgage servicing industry. The rules increase requirements for communications with borrowers, address requirements around the maintenance of customer account records, govern procedural requirements for responding to written borrower requests and complaints of errors, and provide guidance around servicing of delinquent loans, foreclosure proceedings and loss mitigation efforts, among other measures. These rules became effective on January 10, 2014, and have increased the costs to service loans across the mortgage industry, including our mortgage servicing operations.
 Several state agencies overseeing the mortgage industry have entered into settlements and enforcement consent orders with mortgage servicers regarding certain foreclosure practices. These settlements and orders generally require servicers, among other things, to: (i) modify their servicing and foreclosure practices, for example, by improving communications with borrowers and prohibiting dual‑tracking, which occurs when servicers continue to pursue foreclosure during the loan modification process; (ii) establish a single point of contact for borrowers throughout the loan modification and foreclosure processes; and (iii) establish robust oversight and controls of third party vendors, including outside legal counsel, that provide default management or foreclosure services. Although we are not a party to any of these settlements or consent orders, we, like many mortgage servicers, have voluntarily adopted these servicing and foreclosure standards due to competitive pressures.
 Consumer Laws
 Merchants Bank and FMBI must comply with a number of federal consumer protection laws, including, among others:
 •the Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Act, which requires a bank to maintain privacy with respect to certain consumer data in its possession and to periodically communicate with consumers on privacy matters;
 •the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposed a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
 •the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which regulates the timing and content of debt collection communications;
 •the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z thereunder, which requires certain disclosures to consumer borrowers regarding the terms of their loans;
 •the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use and reporting of information related to the credit history of consumers;

 
  14

 

 •the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B thereunder, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of age, race and certain other characteristics, in the extension of credit;
 •the Homeowners Equity Protection Act, which requires, among other things, the cancellation of mortgage insurance once certain equity levels are reached;
 •the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C thereunder, which require mortgage lenders to report certain public loan data;
 •the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and certain other characteristics;
 •the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X thereunder, which imposes conditions on the consummation and servicing of mortgage loans;
 •the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD thereunder, which requires certain disclosures to depositors concerning the terms of their deposit accounts; and
 •the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E thereunder, which governs various forms of electronic banking. This statute and regulation often interact with Regulation CC of the Federal Reserve Board, which governs the settlement of checks and other payment system issues.
 Future Legislation
 In addition to the specific legislation described above, the current administration has signed a number of executive orders and memoranda that could directly impact the regulation of the banking industry. Congress is also considering legislation to reform certain GSEs, including ending the federal government’s conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The orders and legislation may change banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways by increasing or decreasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions.
