Overview
 
Summary
 
Monaker Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries operate online marketplaces. We believe the most promising part of our business plan is the incorporation of Monaker’s proprietary white label Booking Engine and sizeable alternative lodging rental (ALR) properties into well-established marketplaces (i.e. a business-to-business (B2B) model) thereby facilitating easy access of alternative lodging rentals inventory to contracted global distributor partners.
 
Our ambition is to become the largest instantly bookable vacation rental platform in the world, providing large travel distributors via a B2B model, our ALR inventory.
 
Additionally, we plan to provide a superior platform to assist property managers in booking, and broadening the market for, their homes. The Company serves three major constituents: (1) property managers, (2) travelers, and (3) other travel/lodging distributors. Property managers integrate their detailed property listings into the Monaker Booking Engine with the goal of reaching a broad audience of travelers seeking ALRs, through distribution channels they could not access otherwise.
 
All of Monaker’s ALRs, also commonly referred to as Vacation Rentals are:
 

i) | Controlled by Property Management Companies. This is a key point of differentiation for Monaker, as the sole focus of Property Management Companies is to rent and service their properties, unlike an individual home owner who often rents their property on a casual or part-time basis. We believe working with property managers results in four key benefits:
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


All properties are Instantly Bookable (all Property Management Company inventory is integrated into Monaker’s Booking Engine allowing for instant confirmations);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4



Higher levels of service for renters (property managers are full-time operators);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Higher Quality Assurance (property managers generally have an incentive to eliminate trouble properties); and
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Certified Rentable (most property managers are licensed and bonded requiring them to ensure properties are “legal to rent” and are further responsible for paying required taxes on behalf of homeowners.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii) | Exclusively Individual Units. Our vacation homes and residential resort units are never shared, nor do we rent rooms in homes like other ALR companies. All ALR inventory is fully furnished privately owned residential properties, including homes, condominiums, apartments, villas and cabins that property managers rent to the public on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that Monaker’s B2B model of supplying its significant ALR inventory directly to well-established travel distributors has three key benefits being:
 

Monaker avoids the need to market and try and develop its own direct to consumer brand (which can be expensive). Instead it is able to supply product into well established distribution websites that already have significant customer traffic and bookings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Monaker has positioned itself uniquely in the ALR sector - which is one of the fastest growth segments within the travel industry. ALR inventory provides a key solution to traditional travel distributors. According to a January 3, 2017 article by Kevin May, the Editor In Chief of PhocusWire, as posted on Tnooz.com (“Private accommodation travel bookings to reach $106 billion by 2018”), it is estimated that roughly 1 out of 5 lodging accommodations in 2018 was an ALR transaction and by most accounts this growth is continuing to accelerate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Monaker B2B ALR offerings are timely in addressing traditional travel distributors’ needs to protect their client base by allowing them seamless access to ALR products. With the rapid growth of companies like Airbnb, we believe that traditional travel companies are realizing that not having access to this high demand vacation rental inventory means they risk losing their consumers to other ALR sites. By integrating Monaker’s ALR inventory in a “White Label” solution alongside their existing travel products (i.e., Air/Car/Hotel/Cruise/Tour bookings) it solves a key issue by allowing traditional travel distributors the ability for their customers to complete their entire vacation package booking on their website versus forcing them to go to an ALR website and potentially losing the entire booking.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monaker’s Direct to Consumer Websites
 
Monaker has established a direct to consumer presence though a number of websites. While these sites are anticipated to represent a minor portion of the Company’s revenues moving forward, they do perform two very important functions, being:

The direct to consumer platforms are used for demonstration purposes to show traditional travel companies how ALR products could be integrated into their platforms, and
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The sites allow consumers to bundle specialty vacation tours and other offerings with ALR products.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These sites include NextTrip.com, providing access to airline, car rental, lodgings and activities products and, includes our ALR offering which will unite travelers seeking ALRs located in countries around the world and NextTrip.biz (under development) which, when fully operational, will provide a complete tracking solution for business travel as well as discounted air, car, hotel and access to ALR products for business travelers.
 
Another one of our marketplaces, Maupintour.com, provides concierge tours and activities at destinations and our other marketplace, EXVG.com, provides our high-end ALR offering. Our online marketplaces are discussed in greater detail below.
 
NextTrip.com, NextTrip.biz, Maupintour.com and EXVG.com provide both ALR products and auxiliary services directly to consumers, so travelers can purchase compete vacation packages. NextTrip.com, NextTrip.biz, Maupintour.com and EXVG.com (as well as with distributors) allow travelers to search and compare our large and detailed inventory of listings to find ALRs meeting their needs.
 
Monaker is a technology driven Travel Company which has identified and sourced ALR products which it converts into instantly bookable products; this is its distinguishing niche. The ALRs are owned and leased by third parties and are available to rent through Monaker’s websites as well as other distributors. Monaker’s services include critical elements such as technology, an extensive film library, trusted brands and established partnerships that enhance product offerings and reach. We believe that consumers are quickly adopting video for researching and educating themselves prior to purchases, and Monaker has carefully amassed video content, key industry relationships and a prestigious travel brand as cornerstones for the development and deployment of core-technology on both proprietary and partnership platforms.
 
Monaker sells travel services to leisure and corporate customers around the world. Our primary focus is to incorporate ALR options into our current offerings of scheduling, pricing and availability information for booking reservations for airlines, hotels, rental cars, and other travel products such as sightseeing tours, shows and event tickets, and theme park passes. The Company sells these travel services both individually and as components of dynamically-assembled packaged travel vacations and trips. In addition, the Company provides content that presents travelers with information about travel destinations, maps and other travel details. In February 2018, the Company introduced its new travel platform under the NextTrip brand. This platform continues to be improved with a focus on maximizing the consumer’s experience and assisting them in the decision and purchasing process.

The platform is a licensed technology that through our proprietary technology, allows our users to search large travel suppliers of alternative lodging inventories and present consumers comprehensive and optimal alternatives at the most inexpensive rates to choose from.
 
In March 2018, the Company introduced Travelmagazine.com, an online travel publication with the aim of giving travelers around the world inspiration for future travel destinations and trips. The publication offers written articles, videos, and podcasts. Moving forward, we plan for Travelmagazine.com to become a central hub of information for travelers who are looking to get detailed information on destinations all around the world. We also plan to move Travelmagazine.com from having content created by a team of staff writers, to a team of worldwide writers who will contribute content to the page for publication in the future, funding permitting. The website is planned to be supported by advertising and allow for promotion of both ALR and Maupintour vacation products.
 
The Company sells its travel services through various distribution channels. The primary distribution channel is through its business-to-business (B2B) channel partners which include sales via (i) other travel companies’ websites and (ii) networks of third-party travel agents. Secondary distribution will occur through the Company’s own websites at NextTrip.com and NextTripVacations.com, through the NextTrip mobile application (“app”) and Nexttrip.biz. Additionally we offer specialty travel services via our websites, EXVG.com and Maupintour, targeting high value inventory to customers through a toll-free telephone number designed to assist customers with complex or high-priced offerings.
 
Monaker’s core holdings include NextTrip.com, NextTripVacations.com, NextTrip.biz, Maupintour.com and EXVG.com. NextTrip.com and NextTripVacations.com are the primary consumer websites, where travel services and products are booked. The travel services and products include tours; activities/attractions; airlines; hotels; and car rentals and where ALRs are booked as well. Maupintour complements the Nextrip.com and NextTripVacations.com offerings by providing high-end tour packages and activities/attractions. EXVG.com is a specialized secondary website devoted to those ALRs that cannot be booked on a real-time basis. These ALRs tend to be sourced from owners and managers who have not invested in a reservation management system and/or the owner or manager prefers to personally vet the customer before accepting a booking; typically because the ALR is a high value property. EXVG.com travel services and products only include the aforementioned ALRs as well as tours and activities from Maupintour. NextTrip.biz is targeted at small to midsized businesses offering them a customized travel solution for business travel to meetings, conferences, conventions or even vacation travel and gives the companies lower costs, better expense control and the option for a “self-branded” website.
 
Products and Services
 
Monaker plans to focus on marketing ALR options directly to consumers and to other travel distributors. The Company’s concentration on ALRs is driven by contracts with vacation home (including timeshare) unit owners and managers that are made available to consumers and to other travel portals (Distributors) for nightly or extended stays. In addition, we offer travelers activities and tours through our subsidiary, Maupintour. Therefore, not only can we assist a traveler with identifying a destination and the lodging at the destination, but we can provide options of activities while at the destination. We also provide the means for making arrangements for airline tickets, car rentals and lodging (i.e. hotels and ALRs in the near future). In summary, Monaker offers travelers the complete travel package made easy or… Travel Made EasyTM.
 
The average ALR search and booking takes a few hours while the average vacation planning process typically involves the consumer visiting up to seven travel websites and spending over 10 hours to book their vacation (according to Susan Ho, Founder of Journy). We believe the NextTrip.com website using the above features should reduce ALR/Vacation planning time from hours to minutes all with the convenience of one site (truly “Travel Made Easy”).
 
Products and Services for Property Owners and Managers
 
Listings. Property owners and managers are able to list a property, with no initial upfront fees, and provide those listings to us at a negotiated preferential rate for traveler bookings generated on our websites. Listings that are ‘real-time online bookable’ properties will be managed by the property owner or manager through an application program interface (API) which will provide real-time updates to each property and immediately notify the property owner or manager of all information regarding bookings, modifications to bookings and cancellations of bookings. Information such as content, descriptions and images are provided to us through that API.
 
Listings that are ‘request-accept’ properties will require communication and approval from the property owner or manager (hence ‘request-accept’) and will not be managed through an API (as discussed above). We will provide a set of tools for the property owner or manager which will enable them to manage an availability calendar, reservations, inquiries and the content of the listing. These tools will allow the property owner or manager to create the listing by uploading photographs, text descriptions or lists of amenities, a map showing the location of the property, and property availability, all of which can be updated throughout the term of the listing. Each listing will provide travelers the ability to use email or other methods to contact property owners and managers.
 
6


The listings will include tools and services to help property owners and managers run their vacation rental businesses more efficiently such as responding to and managing inquiries, preparing and sending rental quotes and payment invoices, allowing travelers to book online, including being able to enter into rental agreements with travelers online, and processing online payments. Property owners and managers that elect to process online payments will be subject to a transaction fee.
 
Redistribution of Listings. We will make selected, online bookable properties available to online travel agencies as well as channel partners (jointly referred to as “Distributors”). We will be compensated for these services by receiving a commission that is added to the negotiated net rate for each booking.
 
Products and Services for Travelers
 
Search Tools and Ability to Compare. Our online marketplace NextTrip.com provides travelers with tools to search for and filter several travel products including air, car, accommodations (including ALRs) and activities based on various criteria, such as destination, travel dates, type of property, number of bedrooms, amenities, price, or keywords. NextTripVacations.com provides travelers access to our entire listing of ALRs; only lodgings are presented on this website.
Traveler Login. Travelers are able to create accounts on the NextTrip.com website that enable them access to their booking activity through the website.
 
Travel Blog. Travel guides, videos and pictures as well as travel articles can be accessed through the NextTrip Travel Blog and Travelmagazine.com.
 
Security. We use a combination of technology and human review to evaluate the content of listings and to screen for inaccuracies or fraud with the goal of providing only accurate and trustworthy information to travelers.
Reviews and Ratings. Travelers will be able to submit online reviews of the ALRs they have rented through our websites. These reviews should convey the accuracy of the listing information found on our websites.
Communication. Travelers who create an account on our website will receive regular communications, including notices about places of interest, special offers, new listings, and an email newsletter. The newsletter will be available to any traveler who agrees to receive it and offers introductions to new destinations and vacation rentals, as well as tips and useful information when staying in vacation rentals.
Mobile Websites and Applications. We provide versions of our websites formatted for web browsers, smart-phones and tablets so that property owners, managers and travelers can access our websites and tools from mobile devices.
 
The Company has completed integrating several distributors for the booking of our ALR products and the Company continues to integrate suppliers of ALR products as we have surpassed 2.5 million properties in the booking engine.
 
Competition
 
The market to provide listing, searching and marketing services whether they are ALR, activities and tours, airline bookings, car rentals or hotel stays is highly competitive and fragmented with limited barriers to entry. Each of the ALR services that we will provide to property owners, managers and travelers is currently offered by competitors. Furthermore, ALRs are not typically marketed exclusively through any single channel, and many of our listing agreements are not exclusive, potentially allowing our competitors to aggregate a set of listings similar to ours. We believe we will compete primarily on the basis of the quantity, quality, and nature of the properties offered on our websites. The majority of ALRs that will be offered in our marketplace reflect a whole house or property rather than a room. In addition, we anticipate that we will benefit from the quality of the direct relationships we have with property owners and managers, the global diversity of the ALRs available on our websites, the quality of our websites, the tools provided to our property owners and managers, the strength of our brands, and the success of our marketing programs and price.

For a discussion of the risks attendant to the highly competitive nature of our market, see the information under the heading “Part I” – “Item 1A. Risk Factors” – below under the caption “The market in which we participate is highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors.”
 
Seasonality
 
Property owners and managers tend to list their properties when travelers are most likely to make vacation plans. The timing primarily depends on whether travelers are taking a winter or summer vacation and tends to vary by country. The highest level of listings are expected in the first quarter of a year, which is typically when travelers are making plans for summer vacations in the United States and Europe. The lowest level of listings are expected in the third quarter. By the fourth quarter, property owners and managers of winter vacation destinations will be listing their properties in time to meet the needs of travelers planning those trips. Other vacation areas outside of the United States and Europe also have seasonality, which may not be reflected in the same quarters (for example, winter and summer months are reversed in the southern hemisphere).
 
As the listings grow, the seasonality of those transactions may result in higher revenues in the summer and winter vacation months. We also expect seasonality in the number of visitors to our websites, with the first quarter having the highest number of visitors.
 
Research and Development
 
We have developed proprietary systems to create, maintain and operate our websites. This technology consists of systems developed by internal and third party designers, developers and engineers and software acquired or licensed from outside developers and companies. Our systems are designed to serve other property distributors, property owners, managers and travelers in an automated and scalable fashion. Costs associated with our research and development were included as capitalized development costs or, included in several expenses including technology and development, salaries and benefits and in general and administrative expenses.
Technology and Infrastructure
 
Our websites are hosted using a combination of third-party data centers distributed globally across multiple regions. Our systems architecture has been designed to manage increases in traffic on our websites through the addition of server and network hardware without making software changes. Our third-party data centers provide our online marketplace with scalable and redundant Internet connectivity and redundant power and cooling to our hosting environments. We use security methods to ensure the integrity of our networks and protection of confidential data collected and stored on our servers, and we have developed and use internal policies and procedures to protect the personal information of our property owners, managers and travelers using our websites that we collect and use as part of our normal operations. Access to our networks, and the servers and databases, on which confidential data is stored, is protected by industry standard firewall technology. Physical access to our servers and related equipment is secured by limiting access to the data center to operations personnel only. Costs associated with our web hosting operation are included in general and administrative costs.
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property includes the content of our websites, our registered domain names, our registered and unregistered trademarks, contracts with third party property managers and distributors. We believe that our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business and that our registered domain names and our technology infrastructure will give us a competitive advantage in the online market for ALR listings and arrangements with attractions and tour operators. We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States as well as contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brands. We also rely on copyright laws to protect the appearance and design of our sites and applications, although to date we have not registered for copyright protection on any particular content. We have registered numerous Internet domain names related to our business in order to protect our proprietary interests. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and, despite these precautions, it may be possible for other parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our websites or our brand names without authorization.

2018 Registered Offering
 
On September 28, 2018, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with two institutional investors (collectively, the “Investors” and the “Securities Purchase Agreement”), in connection with the sale by the Company to the Investors of 905,000 shares of common stock (the “Shares”) at a purchase price of $2.10 per share (an aggregate of $1,900,500 in gross proceeds) (the “Offering”). Additionally, for each share of common stock purchased by an Investor, such Investor was to receive from the Company a registered warrant to purchase eight-tenths of a share of common stock (warrants to purchase 724,000 shares of common stock in aggregate)(the “Warrants”, and collectively with the Shares, the “Securities”). The warrants had an initial exercise price of $2.85 per share and expire five years from the date of issuance. Each Investor agreed to purchase 452,500 Shares and 362,000 Warrants in the Offering.
 
Roth Capital Partners, LLC, served as sole placement agent for the transaction. After the placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $1.7 million.
 
The Company used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital and other general and administrative purposes, and to repay certain outstanding indebtedness.
 
The transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement and the sale of the securities closed on Tuesday, October 2, 2018.
 
Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the closing date of the sale of the Securities, October 2, 2018 (the “Closing Date”), upon any issuance by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of common stock or common stock equivalents (i.e., securities convertible or exercisable for common stock), for cash consideration, indebtedness or a combination of units thereof (a “Subsequent Financing”), we agreed to provide each Investor a right to participate in an amount of up to 17.5% (35% in aggregate) of the Subsequent Financing on the same terms, conditions and price provided for in the Subsequent Financing, subject to terms and conditions of the Securities Purchase Agreement. The participation rights do not apply to any Exempt Issuance (defined below).

“Exempt Issuance” means the issuance of (a) shares of common stock or options to employees, consultants, officers or directors of the Company pursuant to (i) any stock or option plan duly adopted for such purpose, by a majority of the non-employee members of the Board of Directors or a majority of the members of a committee of non-employee directors established for such purpose for services rendered to the Company; or (ii) the approval of a majority of the non-employee members of the Board of Directors or a majority of the members of a committee of non-employee directors established for such purpose for services rendered to the Company, with shareholder approval where applicable under the rules of any trading market, provided that any such issuances to consultants and pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be limited to 200,000 shares (subject to adjustment for forward and reverse stock splits and the like), in the aggregate, during any 12 month calendar period, provided further, that such securities are issued as “restricted securities” (as defined in Rule 144) and carry no registration rights that require or permit the filing of any registration statement in connection therewith during the ninety days following the Closing Date (collectively, the “Restricted Issuance Requirements”), (b) securities upon the exercise or exchange of or conversion of any securities issued under the Securities Purchase Agreement and/or other securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the date the Securities Purchase Agreement was entered into, provided that such securities are not amended to increase the number of such securities or to decrease the exercise price, exchange price or conversion price of such securities (other than in connection with stock splits or combinations) or to extend the term of such securities, and (c) securities issued pursuant to acquisitions or strategic transactions approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Company, subject to the Restricted Issuance Requirements, and provided that any such issuance shall only be to an operating company or an owner of an asset in a business synergistic with the business of the Company and shall provide to the Company additional benefits in addition to the investment of funds, but shall not include a transaction in which the Company is issuing securities primarily for the purpose of raising capital or to an entity whose primary business is investing in securities, each as described in greater detail in the Securities Purchase Agreement.
 
Warrants - Registered Offering
 Each Warrant had an initial exercise price of $2.85 per share (now $2.00 per share due to certain dilutive issuances). The Warrants are exercisable beginning any time after the grant date (October 2, 2018) and ending five years following the date of grant (October 2, 2023). The Warrant holders are entitled to a “cashless exercise” option if, at any time of exercise, there is no effective registration statement registering, or no current prospectus available for, the issuance or resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants.
 
The Warrants also include anti-dilution rights, which provide that if at any time the Warrants are outstanding, we issue or are deemed to have issued (which includes shares issuable upon exercise of warrants and options and conversion of convertible securities) securities for consideration less than the then current exercise price of the Warrants, the exercise price of such Warrants is automatically reduced to the lowest price per share of consideration provided or deemed to have been provided for such securities, not to be less than $0.57 per share. As of February 28, 2019, the 724,000 warrants had an exercise price of $2.85 per share.
 
Bettwork Industries Inc. Promissory Note
 On October 10, 2018, we entered into a Promissory Note with Bettwork Industries Inc. (“Bettwork”), a related party, in the amount of $200,000 which was amended and superseded by an Amended Promissory Note dated October 19, 2018, in the amount of $230,000 (the “Bettwork Note”).

The following descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.
 
Regulation of the Internet
 
We operate several internet websites which we use to distribute information about, and supplement our programs. Internet services are now subject to regulation in the United States relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under the age of 13, including the federal Child Online Protection Act (COPA) and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM). In addition, a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations. Additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services, covering such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. In addition, to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the United States, the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, including, without limitation, consumer protection, privacy, advertising, data retention, intellectual property, and content limitations, may impose additional compliance obligations on us.
 
Other Regulations
 
We are also subject to various local, state and federal regulations, including, without limitation, regulations promulgated by federal and state environmental, health and labor agencies.
