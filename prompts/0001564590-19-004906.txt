 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.  Statements in this Annual Report that are not historical facts are forward-looking in nature and represent management’s beliefs and assumptions based on currently available information. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “believes,” “intends,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “anticipates,” “expects” or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategies or trends.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we do not know if these expectations will be correct.  Such statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results.  Actual future results could differ materially from those predicted.  The factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially from those described herein are the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report and those described from time to time in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and include, but are not limited to, the following: 
  
• | Future demand for our products,
--+--------------------------------


• | Changes in our raw material and other operating costs (such as zinc, brass and energy costs) and our ability to pass those costs on to our customers or offset them with reductions in other operating costs,

 Should one or more of these risks materialize or if the consequences worsen, or if the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from those currently forecasted or expected.  We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of changes in information, future events or otherwise. 
 Industry Overview 
 We manufacture engineered components utilized in a variety of applications and industries. We manufacture mechanical and electrical cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms used in recreational transportation, postal, office and institutional furniture, cabinetry, tool storage and healthcare applications. We also manufacture stainless steel exhaust systems, gauges, throttle controls, wake enhancement systems and trim tabs for the recreational marine and other industries. We continuously seek to diversify into new markets and identify new applications and features for our products, which we believe provide a greater potential for higher rates of earnings growth as well as diversification of risk.  See also Item 6 – “Selected Financial Data” and Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
Business Segments 
 We currently have two operating business segments – Security Products and Marine Components.  For additional information regarding our segments, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Manufacturing, Operations and Products 
 Security Products.  Our Security Products segment manufactures mechanical and electrical cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms used in a variety of applications including ignition systems, mailboxes, file cabinets, desk drawers, tool storage cabinets, vending and cash containment machines, high security medical cabinetry, electronic circuit panels, storage compartments and gas station security.  Our Security Products segment has one manufacturing facility in Mauldin, South Carolina and one in Grayslake, Illinois which is shared with Marine Components.  We believe we are a North American market leader in the manufacture and sale of cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms.  These products include: 

• | disc tumbler locks which provide moderate security and generally represent the lowest cost lock to produce;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pin tumbler locking mechanisms which are more costly to produce and are used in applications requiring higher levels of security, including KeSet® and System 64® (which each allow the user to change the keying on a single lock 64 times without removing the lock from its enclosure), TuBar® and Turbine™; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | our innovative CompX eLock® and StealthLock® electronic locks which provide stand-alone or networked security and audit trail capability for drug storage and other valuables through the use of a proximity card, magnetic stripe, radio frequency or other keypad credential.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A substantial portion of our Security Products’ sales consist of products with specialized adaptations to an individual customer’s specifications, some of which are listed above.  We also have a standardized product line suitable for many customers, which is offered through a North American distribution network to locksmith and smaller original equipment manufacturer distributors via our STOCK LOCKS® distribution program. 
 Marine Components.  Our Marine Components segment manufactures and distributes stainless steel exhaust components, gauges, throttle controls, wake enhancement systems, trim tabs and related hardware and accessories primarily for performance and ski/wakeboard boats.  Our Marine Components segment has a facility in Neenah, Wisconsin and a facility in Grayslake, Illinois which is shared with Security Products.  Our specialty Marine Component products are high precision components designed to operate within tight tolerances in the highly demanding marine environment.  These products include: 

• | original equipment and aftermarket stainless steel exhaust headers, exhaust pipes, mufflers and other exhaust components;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | high performance gauges such as GPS speedometers and tachometers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mechanical and electronic controls and throttles;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | wake enhancement devices, trim tabs, steering wheels, and billet aluminum accessories; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | dash panels, LED indicators, wire harnesses and other accessories.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 For information regarding our three manufacturing and other facilities, see “Item 2 – Properties,” including information regarding leased and distribution-only facilities. 
 
Raw Materials 
 Our primary raw materials are: 
  
• | Security Products - zinc and brass (for the manufacture of locking mechanisms).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Marine Components - stainless steel (for the manufacture of exhaust headers and pipes and wake enhancement systems), aluminum (for the manufacture of throttles and trim tabs) and other components.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These raw materials are purchased from several suppliers, are readily available from numerous sources and accounted for approximately 12% of our total cost of sales for 2018.  Total material costs, including purchased components, represented approximately 45% of our cost of sales in 2018.
 We occasionally enter into short-term commodity-related raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the impact of future price increases in commodity-related raw materials, including zinc, brass and stainless steel.  These arrangements generally provide for stated unit prices based upon specified purchase volumes, which help us to stabilize our commodity-related raw material costs to a certain extent. During 2017 and 2018, markets for the primary commodity-related raw materials used in the manufacture of our locking mechanisms, primarily zinc and brass, generally strengthened, but were moderating at the end of 2018. Over that same period, the market for stainless steel, the primary raw material used for the manufacture of marine exhaust headers and pipes and wake enhancement systems, remained relatively stable. While we expect the markets for our primary commodity-related raw materials to remain stable during 2019, we recognize that economic conditions could introduce renewed volatility on these and other manufacturing materials. When purchased on the spot market, each of these raw materials may be subject to sudden and unanticipated price increases.  When possible, we seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in these raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions.  In the event we are unable to offset raw material cost increases with other cost reductions, it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products.  Consequently, overall

operating margins can be affected by commodity-related raw material cost pressures.  Commodity market prices are cyclical, reflecting overall economic trends, specific developments in consuming industries and speculative investor activities. 
 Patents and Trademarks 
 We hold a number of patents relating to our component products, certain of which we believe to be important to us and our continuing business activity.  Patents generally have a term of 20 years, and our patents have remaining terms ranging from 1 year to 16 years at December 31, 2018.  
 Our major trademarks and brand names in addition to CompX® include:

 Sales, Marketing and Distribution
A majority of our component sales are direct to large OEM customers through our factory-based sales and marketing professionals supported by engineers working in concert with field salespeople and independent manufacturer’s representatives. We select manufacturer’s representatives based on special skills in certain markets or relationships with current or potential customers. 
 In addition to sales to large OEM customers, a substantial portion of our Security Products sales are made through distributors. We have a significant North American market share of cabinet lock security product sales as a result of the locksmith distribution channel. We support our locksmith distributor sales with a line of standardized products used by the largest segments of the marketplace. These products are packaged and merchandised for easy availability and handling by distributors and end users. 
 We sell to a diverse customer base with only one customer representing 10% or more of our sales in 2018 (United States Postal Service representing 13%). Our largest ten customers accounted for approximately 44% of our sales in 2018.
 Competition 
 The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of product design, including space utilization and aesthetic factors, product quality and durability, price, on-time delivery, service and technical support. We focus our efforts on the middle and high-end segments of the market, where product design, quality, durability and service are valued by the customer. Our Security Products segment competes against a number of domestic and foreign manufacturers. Our Marine Components segment competes with small domestic manufacturers and is minimally affected by foreign competitors.
