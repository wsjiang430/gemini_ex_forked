Item 1. Business.
Company Background
The Company is focused on making structures safe and secure. The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Simpson Strong-Tie Company Inc. ("SST"), designs, engineers and is a leading manufacturer of wood construction products, including connectors, truss plates, fastening systems, fasteners and pre-fabricated lateral systems used in light-frame construction, and concrete construction products used for concrete, masonry, steel construction and for concrete repair, protection and strengthening, including adhesives, chemicals, mechanical anchors, carbide drill bits, powder actuated tools and fiber reinforced materials. The Company markets its products to the residential construction, light industrial and commercial construction, remodeling and do-it-yourself (“DIY”) markets. The Company also provides engineering services in support of some of its products and increasingly offers design and other software that facilitates the specification, selection and use of its products. The Company has continuously manufactured structural connectors since 1956 and believes that the Simpson Strong-Tie brand benefits from strong brand name recognition among architects and engineers who frequently request the use of the Company’s products. 
Business Strategy
The Company attracts and retains customers by designing, manufacturing and selling products that are of high quality and performance, easy to use and cost-effective for customers. The Company manufactures and warehouses its products in geographic proximity to its markets to provide availability and rapid delivery of products to customers and prompt response to customer requests for specially designed products and services. The Company maintains levels of inventory intended to operate with little backlog and fill most customer orders within a few days. High levels of manufacturing automation and flexibility allow the Company to maintain its quality standards while continuing to provide prompt delivery.
The Company intends to continue efforts to increase market share in both the wood construction and concrete construction product groups by:

• | maintaining frequent customer contacts and service levels;


• | continuing to sponsor seminars to inform architects, engineers, contractors and building officials on appropriate use, proper installation and identification of the Company’s products;


• | continuing to invest in mobile, web and software applications for customers to help them do their jobs more efficiently and connect with customers utilizing social media, blog posts and videos; and


• | continuing to innovate and diversify the product offerings.

The Company’s long-term strategy is to develop, acquire or invest in product lines or businesses that have the potential to increase the Company’s earnings per share over time and that:

• | complement the Company’s existing product lines;


• | can be marketed through the Company’s existing distribution channels;


• | might benefit from use of the Company’s brand names and expertise;


• | are responsive to needs of the Company’s customers;


• | expand the Company’s markets geographically; and


• | reduce the Company’s dependence on the United States residential construction market.

New Products. The Company commits substantial resources to new product development. The majority of SST’s products have been developed through its internal research and development program. The Company believes it is the only United States manufacturer with the capability to test multi-story wall systems, thus enabling full scale testing rather than analysis alone to prove system performance. The Company’s engineering, sales, product management, and marketing teams work together with architects, engineers, building inspectors, code officials and customers in the new product development process.
The Company’s product research and development is based largely on products or solutions that are identified within the Company or as customers communicate to the Company as well as the Company’s strategic initiatives to develop new markets or product lines. The Company’s strategy is to develop new products on a proprietary basis, to seek patents when appropriate and to rely on trade secret protection for others. The Company typically develops 15 to 25 new products each year.
The Company expanded its product offering in 2018 by adding:

• | new connectors for wood framing applications;


• | new connectors for cross laminated timber;


• | new steel connection for mid-rise steel construction;


• | new connectors for cold formed steel applications;


• | new products for composite decking; and


• | new mechanical anchors for concrete construction.

The Company intends to continue to expand its product offering.
Distribution channels. The Company seeks to expand its product and distribution coverage through several channels:

• | Distributors. The Company regularly evaluates its distribution coverage and the service levels provided by its distributors, and from time to time implements changes. The Company evaluates distributor product mix and conducts promotions to encourage distributors to add the Company’s products that complement the mix of product offerings in their markets.


• | Home Centers. The Company intends to increase penetration of the DIY markets by continuing to solicit home centers and increase product offerings. The Company’s sales force maintains on-going contact with home centers to work with them in a broad range of areas, including inventory levels, retail display maintenance and product knowledge training. The Company’s strategy is to ensure that the home center retail stores are fully stocked with adequate supplies of the Company’s products carried by those stores. The Company has further developed extensive bar coding and merchandising aids and has devoted a portion of its research efforts to the development of DIY products. The Company’s sales to home centers increased year-over-year in 2018, 2017 and 2016.


• | Dealers. In some markets, the Company sells its products directly to lumber dealers and cooperatives.


• | OEM Relationships. The Company works closely with manufacturers of engineered wood products and OEMs to develop and expand the application and sales of its engineered wood connector and fastener products. The Company has relationships with several of the largest manufacturers of engineered wood products.


• | International Sales. The Company has established a presence in the European Community through acquisition of companies with existing customer bases and through servicing United States-based customers operating in Europe. The Company also distributes connector, anchor and epoxy products in Mexico, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, and the Middle East.

Engineering and Design Services. The Company’s engineers not only design and test products, but also provide engineering support for customers in connection with a number of products that the Company manufactures and sells. This support might range from the discussion of a load value in a catalog to testing the suitability of an existing product in a unique application. For certain product lines, industry norms require that the Company’s engineers are more involved in the sales process. For example, in connection with the sale of our truss plates, the Company’s engineers review the output of the Company’s software to assist customers in ensuring that trusses are properly designed and specified, and in some instances seal design diagrams. Generally, in connection with any engineering services the Company provides, the Company’s engineers serve as a point of reference and support for the customer’s engineers and other service professionals, who ultimately determine and are responsible for the engineering approach to any project.
Sales and Marketing
The Company’s sales and marketing programs are implemented through its branch system. The Company currently maintains branches in California, Texas, Ohio, Canada, England, France, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Poland, Portugal, Austria, The Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, and Chile. Each branch is served by its own sales force, warehouse and office facilities, while some branches have their own manufacturing facilities. Each branch is responsible for setting and executing sales and marketing strategies that are consistent both with the markets in the geographic area that the branch serves and with the goals of the Company. Branch sales forces in North America are supported by marketing managers in the home office in Pleasanton, California. The home office also coordinates issues affecting customers that operate in multiple regions. The sales force maintains close working relationships with customers, develops new business, calls on architects, engineers and building officials and participates in a range of educational seminars.
The Company dedicates substantial resources to customer service. The Company produces numerous publications and point-of-sale marketing aids to serve specifiers, distributors, retailers and users for the various markets that it serves. These publications include general catalogs, as well as various specific catalogs, such as those for its fastener products. The catalogs and publications describe the products and provide load and installation information. The Company also maintains several linked websites centered 
on www.strongtie.com, which include catalogs, product and technical information, code reports and other general information related to the Company, its product lines and promotional programs. The contents of these websites are not incorporated into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to the URLs for these websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.
Manufacturing Process
The Company designs and manufactures most of its products. The Company has developed and uses automated manufacturing processes for many of its products. The Company’s innovative manufacturing systems and techniques have allowed it to control manufacturing costs, even while developing both new products and products that meet customized requirements and specifications. The Company’s development of specialized manufacturing processes has also permitted increased operating flexibility and enhanced product design innovation. As part of ongoing continuous improvement processes in its factories, the Company’s major North American and European manufacturing facilities initiated lean manufacturing practices to improve efficiency and customer service. The Company sources some products from third-party vendors, both domestically and internationally. The Company has 26 manufacturing locations in the United States, Canada, France, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Portugal, Belgium, Sweden, China and England.
Quality Control.  The Company has developed a quality system that manages defined procedures to ensure consistent product quality and also meets the requirements of product evaluation reports such as the International Code Council Evaluation Services (ICC-ES) and the International Association of Plumbers and Mechanical Officials Uniform Evaluation Services (IAPMO-UES). Since 1996, the Company’s quality system has been registered under ISO 9001, an internationally recognized set of quality-assurance standards. The Company believes that ISO registration is a valuable tool for maintaining and promoting its high quality standards. As the Company establishes new business locations through expansion or acquisitions, projects are established to integrate the Company’s quality systems and achieve ISO 9001 registration. In addition, the Company has six testing laboratories accredited to ISO standard 17025, an internationally accepted standard that provides requirements for the competence of testing and the further specialized accreditation for various Acceptance Criteria. The Company implements testing requirements through systematic control of its processes, enhancing the Company’s standard for quality products, whether produced by the Company or purchased from others.
Wood Construction Products Manufacturing. Most of the Company’s wood construction products are produced with a high level of automation. The Company has significant press capacity and has multiple dies for some of its high volume products to enable production of these products close to the customer and to provide back-up capacity. The balance of production is accomplished through a combination of manual, blanking and numerically controlled (NC) processes that include robotic welders, lasers and turret punches. This capability allows the Company to produce products with little redesign or set-up time, facilitating rapid turnaround for customers. The Company also has smaller specialty production facilities, which primarily use batch production with some automated lines.
Concrete Construction Products Manufacturing. The Company manufactures its concrete construction products at its facilities in Zhangjiagang, China; West Chicago, Illinois; Cardet, France; Seewen, Switzerland; Malbork, Poland; Elvas, Portugal and Madrid, Spain. The mechanical anchor products are produced with a high level of automation. Some products, such as epoxy and adhesive anchors, are mixed in batches and are then loaded into one-part or two-part dispensers, which mix the product on the job site because set-up times are usually very short. In addition, the Company purchases a number of products, powder actuated pins, tools and accessories and certain of its mechanical anchoring products, from various sources around the world. These purchased products undergo inspections on a sample basis for conformance with ordered specifications and tolerances before being distributed.
Regulation
Environmental Regulation. The Company itself is subject to environmental laws and regulations governing emissions into the air, discharges into water, and generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. The Company is also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters. The Company believes that it has obtained all material licenses and permits required by environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in connection with the Company’s operations and that its policies and procedures comply in all material respects with existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”
Other. The Company’s product lines are subject to federal, state, county, municipal and other governmental and quasi-governmental regulations that affect product development, design, testing, analysis, load rating, application, marketing, sales, exportation, installation and use. 
The Company considers product evaluation, recognition and listing to the building code as a significant tool that facilitates and expedites the use of the Company’s products by design professionals, building officials, inspectors, builders, home centers and 
contractors. Industry members are more likely to use building products that have the appropriate recognition and listing than products that lack this acceptance. The Company devotes considerable time and testing resources to obtaining and maintaining appropriate listings for its products. The Company actively participates in industry related professional associations and building code committees both to keep abreast of regulatory changes and to provide comments and expertise to these regulatory agencies.
A substantial portion of the Company’s products have been evaluated and are recognized by governmental and product evaluation agencies. Some of the entities that recognize the Company’s products include the International Code Council Evaluation Service (ICC-ES), the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials Uniform Evaluation Services (IAPMO-UES), the City of Los Angeles Research Reports (LARR’s), California Division of the State Architect Interpretation of Regulations (DSA IR’s), the State of Florida, Underwriters Laboratory (UL), Factory Mutual (FM) and state departments of transportation. In Europe, the Company’s structural products meet European Technical Agreement (ETA) regulations.
Competition 
The Company faces a variety of competition in all of the markets in which it participates. This competition ranges from subsidiaries of large national or international corporations to small regional manufacturers. While price is an important factor, the Company also competes on the basis of quality, breadth of product line, proprietary technology, technical support, availability of inventory, service (including custom design and manufacturing), field support and product innovation. As a result of differences in structural design and building practices and codes, the Company’s markets tend to differ by region. Within these regions, the Company competes with companies of varying size, several of which also distribute their products nationally or internationally. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”
Raw Materials
The principal raw material used by the Company is steel, including stainless steel. The Company also uses materials such as carbon fiber, fiberglass, mortars, grouts, epoxies and acrylics in the manufacture of its chemical anchoring and reinforcing products. The Company purchases raw materials from a variety of commercial sources. The Company’s practice is to seek cost savings and enhanced quality by purchasing from a limited number of suppliers.
The steel industry is highly cyclical and prices for the Company’s raw materials are influenced by numerous factors beyond the Company’s control. The steel market continues to be dynamic, with a high degree of uncertainty about future pricing trends. Given current conditions, including significant import tariffs and duties, and unsettled international trade disputes, the Company currently expects that the high degree of uncertainty regarding steel prices will continue. Numerous factors may cause steel prices to increase in the future. In addition to increases in steel prices, steel mills may add surcharges for zinc, energy and freight in response to increases in their costs. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The Company historically has not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials. However, the Company may purchase and carry more steel or other raw materials in inventory to meet projected sales demand in a tight raw materials market.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
The Company has United States and foreign patents, the majority of which cover products that the Company currently manufactures and markets. These patents, and applications for new patents, cover various design aspects of the Company’s products, as well as processes used in their manufacture. The Company continues to develop new potentially patentable products, product enhancements and product designs. Although the Company does not intend to apply for additional foreign patents covering existing products, the Company has developed an international patent program to protect new products that it may develop. In addition to seeking patent protection, the Company relies on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain its competitive position. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”
Acquisitions and Expansion into New Markets
We have invested in our strategic initiative to sell engineered product solutions, to help us perform throughout all industry cycles, which we estimate supports approximately 40% of our connector and truss plate sales. In support of this effort, we acquired CG Visions, Inc. (“CG Visions”) in 2017, and completed our purchase of the LotSpec software asset and entered into a strategic software partnership with Hyphen Solutions ("Hyphen") in 2018. 
The LotSpec software asset is a suite of software applications that facilitate builders’ abilities to complete complex designs and do full take-offs in collaboration with our CG Visions software. Hyphen offers integrated information exchange between its software and our existing CG Visions' take-off platform to more efficiently create detailed plan estimates, designs and production specifications to automatically flow through to purchasing systems. We believe that the LotSpec software purchase and the Hyphen strategic partnership align well with our strategy to continue strengthening our value proposition by being the industry's trusted partner in construction solutions and building systems software. 
In January 2017, the Company acquired CG Visions, Inc. ("CG Visions"), an Indiana corporation, for $20.8 million. CG Visions provides scalable technologies and services in building information modeling ("BIM") technologies, estimation tools and software solutions to a number of the top 100 mid-sized to large builders in the United States, which are expected to complement and support the Company's sales in North America.
In January 2017, the Company acquired Gbo Fastening Systems AB ("Gbo Fastening Systems"), a Sweden limited company, for $10.2 million. Gbo Fastening Systems manufactures and sells a complete line of CE-marked structural fasteners as well as fastener dimensioning software for wood construction applications, currently sold mostly in northern and eastern Europe, which are expected to complement the Company's line of wood construction products in Europe.
In August 2016, the Company purchased all of the outstanding shares of Multi Services Dêcoupe S.A. ("MS Decoupe"), a Belgium public limited company, for $6.9 million. MS Decoupe primarily manufactures and distributes wood construction, plastic, and metal labeling products in Belgium and the Netherlands, including distributing the Company's products manufactured at the Company's production facility in France. With this acquisition, the Company will offer the Belgium market a wider-range of its products, shorten delivery lead times, and expand the Company's sales presence into the Netherlands market. 
Seasonality and Cyclicality
The Company’s sales are seasonal and cyclical. Operating results vary from quarter to quarter and with economic cycles. The Company’s sales are also dependent, to a large degree, on the North American residential home construction industry. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 3,135 full-time employees, of whom 1,806 were hourly employees and 1,329 were salaried employees. The Company believes that its overall compensation and benefits for the most part meet or exceed industry averages and that its relations with its employees are good.
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 14% of the Company's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have two-facility locations with collective bargaining agreements covering tool and die craftsmen, maintenance workers, and sheet-metal workers. In Stockton, California, two union contracts will expire in September 2019 and June 2023, respectively. Also, we have two contracts in San Bernardino County, California that will expire in June 2022 and February 2021, respectively. We expect to agree on the extension with the existing labor union contract that will expire in September 2019, while parties are negotiating a new agreement. Based on current information and subject to future events and circumstances, we believe that, even if new agreements are not reached before the existing labor union contracts expire, it is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to provide products to customers or on the Company's profitability. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”
