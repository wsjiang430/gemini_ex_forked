 Item 1.  Business.
 Overview
 Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. (“we,” “us,” and “our”) is a medical technology company that develops and provides innovative medical devices for the treatment of chronic diseases. We were originally incorporated in Minnesota under the name Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. on January 30, 1995. During 2006, we established a merger corporation and subsequently, on July 21, 2006, merged with and into this merger corporation resulting in us being reincorporated as a Delaware corporation. The resulting corporation assumed the name Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. and in September 2013, we began doing business as “Tactile Medical.” Our mission is to help people suffering from chronic diseases live better and care for themselves at home. We focus our efforts on advancing the standard of care in treating chronic diseases in the home setting to improve patient outcomes and quality of life and help control rising healthcare expenditures. We possess a unique, scalable platform to deliver at-home healthcare solutions directly to patients throughout the United States. This evolving home care delivery model is recognized by policy-makers and insurance payers as a key for controlling rising healthcare costs. Our solutions deliver cost-effective, clinically proven, long-term treatment for people with these chronic diseases. We believe that our clinically proven, at-home treatment options for lymphedema and venous leg ulcers provide a continuity of care, service and support that improves outcomes, reduces costs and gives people their lives back. 
 We employ a direct-to-patient and -provider model, through which we obtain patient referrals from clinicians, manage insurance claims on behalf of our patients and their clinicians, deliver our solutions directly to patients and train them on the proper use of our solutions in their homes. This model allows us to directly approach patients and clinicians, whereby we disintermediate the traditional durable medical equipment channel and capture both the manufacturer and distributor margins. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated revenues of $143.8 million and had net income of $6.6 million. Our revenues increased 32% during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. 
 Lymphedema is a type of chronic swelling, or edema, which occurs in the arms, legs, neck, trunk or other body parts when the lymphatic vessels are unable to adequately drain protein-rich lymph fluid from these regions. Lymphedema is progressive in nature, worsens over time, and has no known cure. Chronic venous insufficiency is a condition that occurs when the venous wall and/or valves in the veins are not working effectively, making it difficult for blood to return to the heart from the affected region(s). When the venous system does not effectively transfer blood from the lower limbs, it can result in venous hypertension and the development of painful, slow-healing wounds on the lower leg called venous leg ulcers. Venous hypertension can also lead to a marked increase in fluid build-up in the limbs, overwhelming the lymphatic system and causing lymphedema. Our proprietary Flexitouch system is a clinically proven at-home solution for patients with vascular disorders like lymphedema. Our proprietary Actitouch system is an ambulatory, home-based solution for chronic venous insufficiency patients that may be worn throughout the day. Our products deliver cost-effective, clinically proven, long-term treatment of chronic diseases. Patients with lymphedema or chronic venous insufficiency are typically treated by vascular surgeons, vascular medicine physicians, wound physicians, wound nurses and lymphedema therapists. 
 Our advanced at-home Flexitouch system provides effective automated, at-home lymphatic drainage therapy. Its patented, curved chambers stimulate the lymphatic system to remove excess fluid and reduce swelling. The pneumatic chambers sequentially inflate and deflate for only a few seconds each, creating a gentle wave-like application of pressure to stimulate the movement of lymphatic fluid and direct it towards properly functioning areas of the body. Peer-reviewed, published studies have shown that our Flexitouch system provides improved patient quality of life and clinical outcomes, and delivers significant cost savings to payers and patients. The first generation of our Flexitouch system received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in July 2002 and our second-generation Flexitouch system received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in October 2006. In September 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the Flexitouch system in treating lymphedema in the head and neck. In June 2017, we announced that we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the Flexitouch Plus, the third-generation version of our Flexitouch system. Our Flexitouch system generated $131.9 million, or 92%, of our revenues in 2018, and

$100.3 million, or 92%, of our revenues in 2017. 
 Our Actitouch system provides precise, consistent and wearable compression that a patient may apply, remove and reapply at home. This system was developed to provide maximum convenience for patients by providing them with the freedom to remain active while simultaneously receiving the clinically proven benefits of sustained and intermittent pneumatic compression, which we refer to as dual-compression. Our Actitouch system received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in June 2013 and we began selling the product in September 2013. Due to a decrease in the demand for and sales volume of our Actitouch system, we plan to discountinue this product line in the second half of 2019, see “Our Products – Actitouch System” below for further discussion. We also introduced the Entre system in the United States in February 2013. The Entre system is sold to patients for whom a basic pump is suitable or who do not yet qualify for insurance reimbursement for an advanced compression device such as our Flexitouch system. Our Entre and Actitouch systems combined generated $11.8 million, or 8%, of our revenues in 2018, and $8.9 million, or 8%, of our revenues in 2017.
 In October 2018, we licensed the intellectual property rights related to the Airwear Gradient Compression Wrap, or the Airwear wrap, in the U.S. and Canada, for use in all medical applications, including but not limited to swelling/edema and ulcers (including lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency conditions), but excluding the use of the intellectual property in the field of prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis. The Airwear wrap is indicated for the management of venous insufficiency, venous hypertension, venous ulcerations and lymphedema. Compression therapy is the standard of care for these conditions and the Airwear wrap works by delivering precise gradient compression to the lower leg. We plan to begin selling the Airwear wrap in the second half of 2019. 
 To support the growth of our business, we invest heavily in our commercial infrastructure, consisting of our direct sales force, reimbursement capabilities and clinical expertise. We are a national, accredited provider of home medical equipment services approved for coverage by private payers, Medicare, the Veterans Administration and certain Medicaid programs in the United States. Our direct sales force is focused on increasing clinician awareness of our solutions and has grown to over 200 sales representatives as of December 31, 2018, compared to over 160 representatives as of December 31, 2017. We also utilize over 560 licensed, independent healthcare practitioners as home trainers who educate patients on the proper use of our solutions. Our Reimbursement Department, composed of over 70 employees, was reorganized in 2018 to improve operational efficiencies and enhance individual payer expertise, while continuing our strategic focus on payer development. The Reimbursement Department is now composed of our Payer Development and Reimbursement Operations groups. Our Payer Development group is composed of both strategic and analytical teams, with focus on payer decision-maker relationships and education, payer policy development and revision, payer contract negotiations, and payer data analysis. Our experienced Reimbursement Operations group is responsible for verifying patient insurance benefits, individual patient case development, prior authorization submissons, case follow-up, and appeals when necessary. Our clinical team, consisting of a scientific advisory board, in-house therapists and nurses, and a medical director (part-time), serves as a resource to clinicians and patients and guides our development of clinical evidence in support of our products. We believe these investments are critical to driving payer, physician and patient adoption of our technologies, and together with our commercial infrastructure, represent a significant competitive advantage. 
 Health insurance coverage for our Flexitouch, Entre and Actitouch systems is in place with private payers, Medicare, the Veterans Administration and certain Medicaid programs. Based on our estimates, we are contracted or enrolled as an in-network provider with payers covering over 275 million lives in the United States. Over 120,000 patients have been treated with our Flexitouch system since its launch in 2004, and over 32,000 Flexitouch systems were shipped in 2018. More than 29,000 patients have been treated with our Entre and Actitouch systems since their launch in 2013, and over 8,000 Entre and Actitouch systems were shipped in 2018. We do not currently have any operations or sales outside the United States.
 Overview of the Lymphedema and Chronic Venous Insufficiency Markets 
 Lymphedema 
 The lymphatic system, a fundamental part of the cardiovascular system, consists of lymph vessels and lymph organs that protect the body against harmful bacteria and transport lymph fluid from the body’s tissues

back to the cardiovascular system. Lymph vessels are thin-walled capillaries that absorb fluids, bacteria and proteins, and propel them to lymph nodes, small lymph organs that filter and process the lymph fluid by eliminating waste and bacteria. Lymph nodes are located in several areas of the body, including superficial and deep lymph nodes under each arm, at the hip, in the groin, above the collar bones in the neck, in the abdomen, tonsils and spleen, and in bone marrow. Lymph vessels and lymph nodes work together with larger lymph structures to help maintain a normal healthy fluid balance.
 Lymphedema occurs when there is impairment to the lymphatic system, disrupting normal transport of lymph fluid within the body and causes severe and debilitating symptoms, including decreased mobility, skin breakdown, pain, increased risk of serious infection and marked psychosocial impairment, resulting in significant negative implications for a patient's health and quality of life. When the lymphatic system becomes overwhelmed, damaged, or blocked for an extended period of time, lasting swelling (referred to as chronic edema) occurs. Symptoms related to lymphedema can present anywhere in the body, including the head, neck, arms, legs, trunk and genitals. For most patients with lymphedema, it has a negative impact on their quality of life. Performing daily activities of cooking, shopping, cleaning and yard work can often become difficult, if not impossible, for patients who suffer from lymphedema. For patients with head and neck lymphedema, critical functions such as swallowing, breathing and range of motion can be negatively impacted. Over time, the accumulation of lymph fluid can result in significant changes in the structure of the tissues, causing thickening and hardening of the skin, referred to as fibrosis. Recurrent skin infections such as erysipelas and cellulitis, a more serious skin infection, are common complications of lymphedema.
 Lymphedema worsens over time if not properly treated, and it currently has no known cure. When untreated, lymphedema can become painful and debilitating. The symptoms of lymphedema can be managed however, and patients who are educated about effective treatment options can improve their quality of life.
 Misdiagnosis of lymphedema is common, and often patients do not get the medical care they need until significant symptoms have occurred. Proper diagnosis of lymphedema may require evaluation by a physician or other healthcare provider with knowledge of lymphedema and its visible symptoms. While not required to develop a lymphedema diagnosis, some clinicians may choose to perform diagnostic testing. Diagnostic tests for lymphedema include history and physical examination, soft tissue and vascular imaging, lymph node imaging, volume measurements, changes in electrical conductance, changes in biomechanical properties, genetic testing and blood tests for other conditions that have similar symptoms to lymphedema. The International Society of Lymphology categorizes the progression of lymphedema from Stage 0, the least severe stage, to Stage 3, the most severe stage. 
  Chronic Venous Insufficiency 
 Chronic venous insufficiency occurs when the venous wall and/or valves in the veins are not working effectively, making it difficult for blood to return to the heart. The disease is prevalent among patients who are obese or pregnant and may also be caused by high blood pressure, trauma, lack of exercise, smoking, deep vein thrombosis and inflammation of the vein walls. As the valves deteriorate, blood is no longer able to effectively travel in the normal direction, leading to increased pressure in the vascular system, stretching and dilating vessels, which exacerbates the problem. Prolonged or untreated chronic venous insufficiency may permanently damage the lymphatic system. As hypertension increases, more fluid is pushed out of the vascular system leading to swelling, progressive tissue breakdown, skin infections and venous leg ulcers. Ulcers develop in areas with edema as swelling interferes with the movement of oxygen and nutrients through tissues, and if left untreated, these ulcers can quickly become infected or even gangrenous. Physicians diagnose chronic venous insufficiency based on appearance, symptoms and imaging techniques and classify it based upon a scale endorsed by the Society for Vascular Surgery.  Market Opportunity 
 Lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency are costly and lifelong conditions with debilitating physical and psychological impacts on patients. We estimate that more than five million people in the United States are living with lymphedema. Based on an analysis of claims data commissioned by us, we estimated that approximately 1.1 million patients were diagnosed with lymphedema during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018. Based on a similar analysis of claims data commissioned by us, we estimated that there 

 
  5

 
were approximately 700,000 patients diagnosed with lymphedema during the 12 months ended June 30, 2014. This represents a 10.6% average annual increase in the number of patients diagnosed with lymphedema over the period from June 30, 2014 to December 31, 2018. We estimate that the addressable market opportunity for our Flexitouch system exceeds $4.2 billion in the United States, which is based on the number of patients diagnosed with lymphedema and our average selling price per device. 
 We believe that chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, afflicts approximately 3-11% of the U.S. population, and this percentage may rise due to the growing prevalence of obesity, cancer, and smoking, as well as an aging population. We estimate the addressable market opportunity for our Airwear wrap is in excess of 3.1 million patients in the United States, which is based on an analysis of claims data commissioned by us of patients diagnosed with CVI.
 In the fourth quarter of 2016 we expanded the indications for the Flexitouch system. We received U.S. FDA clearance to market a first-of-its-kind system to treat patients suffering from lymphedema of the head and neck, a frequent consequence of head and neck cancer and its treatment. Patient symptoms often include significant skin changes, pain and discomfort, as well as difficulty breathing and swallowing. The American Cancer Society estimates that 400,000 people in the United States suffer from cancers of the head and neck, and more than 60,000 new patients are diagnosed each year. In a 2016 clinical publication, researchers at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine estimated that more than 75% of patients with head and neck cancer will develop lymphedema requiring treatment. Our Flexitouch Head and Neck system is the only pneumatic compression device with an indication to treat patients suffering from debilitating head and neck lymphedema. We estimate the market opportunity for our Flexitouch Head and Neck system is approximately $1 billion in the United States, which is based on 75% of the total number of patients suffering from cancers of the head and neck and our average selling price per device.
 Current Treatment and Limitations 
 A traditional treatment for lymphedema is complete decongestive therapy consisting of manual lymphatic drainage, which is a specialized application of gentle pressure to the skin applied by a therapist that encourages drainage of lymph fluid, as well as decongestive exercises, skin care and compression with multilayered bandages, compression garments or pumps. Typically, this therapy begins with clinic visits three to five times per week for four to eight weeks, which is costly, inconvenient for the patient, and time consuming. At that point, clinical improvement plateaus or reimbursement for the therapy ends and patients transition to self-administered home-based care. Manual lymphatic drainage is difficult for patients to self-administer due to limited range of motion and treatment techniques that are difficult to replicate, and pump-based compression using simple pumps can be uncomfortable and has not demonstrated the benefits of our Flexitouch advanced pneumatic pump. To address these limitations, our at-home Flexitouch system was developed to provide automated lymphatic drainage therapy through an advanced, easy-to-use, self-applied at-home system. Peer-reviewed, published studies have shown that our Flexitouch system provides improved quality of life and clinical outcomes and delivers significant cost savings to payers and patients. 
 The standard of care treatment for chronic venous insufficiency is compression therapy. As the disease progresses, patients may develop a venous leg ulcer, which is commonly treated using multilayered bandages to minimize swelling and enhance blood flow. A clinician applies these non-removable bandages to patients at a precise pressure and patients wear the bandages between weekly visits to the wound clinic during which they are then removed and reapplied. Treatment typically occurs for several months and impairs patient quality of life by limiting bathing, range of motion and other activities. Treatment efficacy is inconsistent because bandages can lose their precise pressure between treatments. Patients use our Actitouch system to administer intermittent pneumatic compression therapy to assist with the circulation of blood through affected veins. Our Actitouch system provides precise, sustained and wearable compression that a patient may apply, remove and reapply at home, allowing patients to bathe, sleep comfortably and increase mobility. In a clinical study, our Actitouch system was shown to have comparable efficacy in healing venous leg ulcers and achieved higher patient quality of life scores as compared to multilayered bandages.

Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to become a leader in the at-home treatment of chronic diseases. We intend to leverage our established product, service and fulfillment platforms to be a global provider of clinically proven, easy-to-use and cost-effective solutions. The key elements of our strategy include: 
· | Increase awareness of our solutions and establish them as the standards of care. We believe that many patients with lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency are undiagnosed or undertreated, and we intend to further educate physicians, wound nurses, lymphedema therapists, patients and payers to raise awareness of these diseases, the associated health burdens of such diseases on patients and society, and the clinical and economic benefits of using our products. We intend to continue promoting this awareness through advertising campaigns, exhibiting at tradeshows and physician meetings, training and educating clinicians and publishing additional clinical and economic outcome data demonstrating the benefits of our solutions. Our ongoing marketing initiatives focus on increasing referrals from physicians trained in venous and lymphatic diseases. In addition, we plan to launch more extensive direct-to-provider and patient marketing programs that we believe will further increase awareness of our solutions.

· | Expand our direct sales and customer support teams. We plan to expand our direct sales and marketing organization to drive greater product adoption by patients and their clinicians. We intend to strengthen our distribution network by continuing to recruit, train and retain talented sales representatives and increasing the number of licensed home trainers. With an expanded sales force, we believe we could target additional clinical call points.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Introduce new features and products to grow our technology platform. We are actively exploring new products and features for our portfolio in order to expand the number of patients using our products and allow us to enter new clinical adjacencies. We pursue both internal research, design and development, and also work with external collaborators to expand our product offerings. In addition, we evaluate opportunities to license or acquire additional technologies and products to expand our total addressable market opportunity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue the development of clinical and economic outcome data. A key part of our success is our ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of our products through clinical and economic outcome data. We intend to invest in additional studies to support peer-reviewed, published articles that evidence the clinical and economic benefits of our solutions as compared to traditional treatments. We intend to use these data to continue to educate clinicians, payers and patients on the proven advantages of our products compared to other therapies and expand our network of key opinion leader advocates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand third-party reimbursement. Our products are covered under existing reimbursement codes, and we have secured coverage for our solutions with private payers, Medicare, the Veterans Administration and certain Medicaid programs. Our team has experienced significant success in obtaining positive coverage policies from payers by developing direct relationships with payer decision-makers, leveraging our relationships with physician societies and key opinion leaders, providing clinical data, demonstrating the efficacy of our products and educating payers on the limitations of traditional treatments. We intend to continue this strategic approach to further expand coverage for our solutions, as well as to meet payer-specific requirements on behalf of patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Introduce our solutions outside the United States. We currently sell our products only within the United States. While our plan is to continue to focus our direct sales efforts on penetrating the U.S. market, we plan to pursue future international expansion. We have European CE Mark approval for our current Flexitouch system. We also have a Medical Device License in Canada for our Flexitouch system.

Our Products 
 We market our Flexitouch, Entre and Actitouch systems, and we plan to market the Airwear wrap, as at-home therapies for the treatment of lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency. These products have received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to be marketed in the United States. We believe our products have unique features and benefits that address the shortcomings of traditional treatments, are more cost-effective and enable more consistent and effective therapy, leading to enhanced patient quality of life, improved clinical outcomes and reduced cost of care.  Flexitouch System 
 Our Flexitouch system is a fully automated, programmable, advanced pneumatic compression device designed for treatment of lymphedema in the home setting. Our Flexitouch system has received 510(k) clearance for the treatment of lymphedema, certain types of edema, venous insufficiencies and certain types of leg ulcers. We introduced our first-generation Flexitouch system in the United States in 2003, our second-generation Flexitouch system in 2006, and our third-generation Flexitouch system, the Flexitouch Plus, in 2018. The mechanism of action of our patented Flexitouch Plus system is designed to stimulate the lymphatic system similar to manual lymphatic drainage therapy, the current standard of care in patient treatment. By automating this technique, we believe our system offers an effective, cost-efficient, convenient and accessible at-home treatment for patients. 
 Our Flexitouch Plus system consists of an electronic controller unit that offers 17 treatment settings and multiple contoured garment configurations for the trunk, chest, head, neck and the arm or leg. Our Flexitouch Plus is the only pneumatic compression system offering the flexibility for treating upper and lower extremities, the trunk and chest, and the head and neck. The electronic controller is a pneumatic compressor with four connector outlets. Each connector has eight outflow ports into which the garment hoses are connected. Our unique garments contain up to 32 air chambers, are made of a soft, pliable fabric and are designed with hook-and-loop fasteners to fit snugly around affected areas for maximum comfort and optimum pressure delivery. The garments come in a variety of sizes that can be easily adjusted to patients of all sizes. When our system is activated, air passes through the hoses, delivering sequential inflation and deflation to the garments and applying gentle pressure to the skin. The inflation sequence is designed to stimulate the lymphatic system, moving lymph fluid from the impaired areas toward healthy regions of the body. 
 The electronic controller unit adjusts the amount of pressure and the timing of the pressure and release cycles. This unit is lightweight and easily portable, providing maximum convenience for at-home treatment. A typical therapy session using our Flexitouch Plus system lasts one hour, with additional treatment options available if prescribed by a clinician. 
 Entre System 
 We introduced our Entre system in the United States in February 2013 to offer a lightweight, portable pneumatic compression solution for patients with cognitive or dexterity issues who need a basic (simple) pump or for patients who do not yet qualify for insurance coverage of an advanced compression device such as our Flexitouch Plus system. Our Entre system is a basic pneumatic compression device used for the at-home treatment of venous disorders including lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency, including venous leg ulcers. Our Entre system is a pump with garments covering the arm or leg with eight chambers that inflate in sequence and remain inflated for a preset time period. All chambers deflate at once. Our Entre system moves fluid from fingers or toes toward areas closer to the trunk. The system can be programmed to a variety of pressures delivering a prescribed treatment customized to meet the patient's needs. 
 Actitouch System    We introduced our Actitouch system in the United States in September 2013. Our wearable Actitouch system combines intermittent pneumatic compression with sustained gradient compression to the lower leg and foot to improve and accelerate wound healing, as compared to the current standard of care, which involves sustained compression applied with compression wraps or multilayered bandages.

 Actitouch consists of a compression sleeve, a control unit, an undersock and a power adapter/charger. The compression sleeve has four chambers that inflate to apply pressure to the leg, is designed with hook and loop fasteners to accommodate a wide range of leg shapes and sizes and may be worn under clothing and with most shoes. The control unit is concealed within the compression sleeve and monitors and adjusts the air pressure to ensure the correct level of compression is applied to the leg throughout the day. It offers a therapy tracker that monitors and displays average daily use to reinforce therapy goals. The undersock is designed to draw perspiration and moisture away from the skin and has padding in key areas to provide additional comfort. The system comes with a power adapter/charger that is used to power the device directly during intermittent pneumatic compression mode or to charge the battery for ambulatory use. The battery life allows the patient to wear the system all day without recharging. 
 Our Actitouch system operates in intermittent pneumatic compression mode or sustained compression mode. In sustained compression mode, the system provides sustained, graduated compression to the leg at preset pressures, and the compact, lightweight design gives patients the freedom to stay active while experiencing the benefits of a more comfortable compression therapy. The system ensures consistent compression regardless of variations in sleeve application, and monitors and adjusts pressure automatically every 30 minutes in response to changes in leg circumference. In intermittent pneumatic compression mode, the system performs cyclic inflation/deflation sequences to preset gradient pressures. Standard daily treatment involves two hours of intermittent compression while seated or reclining and 10 hours of sustained compression while active. The system is worn throughout the day and has the advantage of being removable for bathing or showering, changing primary bandaging, and when driving or operating machinery. The patient removes the system for sleep, allowing the battery to be recharged overnight. 
 We have observed a steady decrease in the demand for and sales volume of our Actitouch system over the past three years, reflecting a reduction in the overall future marketability of the product line.  As a result, the current Actitouch system and corresponding product line will be discontinued in the second half of 2019. Due to the planned discontinuation of the current product line, we recorded a $2.5 million non-cash impairment charge to fully write off the inventory and intangible assets related to our Actitouch system. We believe the Airwear gradient compression wrap provides access to a larger population of patients with chronic venous insufficiency and does so earlier in their treatment pathway, while providing enhanced benefits as compared to the Actitouch system.
 Airwear Gradient Compression Wrap 
 The Airwear Gradient Compression Wrap, or the “Airwear wrap”, was introduced in the United States in 2007, under the trade name Aero-Wrap, to provide precise compression from the foot up to the knee. The intellectual property rights related to the Airwear wrap are owned by Sun Scientific, Inc., or Sun Scientific. In October 2018, we entered into a license agreement with Sun Scientific pursuant to which we licensed certain intellectual property of Sun Scientific, including related to the Airwear wrap, in the U.S. and Canada, for use in all medical applications, including but not limited to swelling/edema and ulcers (including lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency conditions), but excluding the use of the intellectual property in the field of prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis. 
 The Airwear wrap is indicated for the management of venous insufficiency, venous hypertension, venous ulcerations and lymphedema. Compression therapy is the standard of care for these conditions and the Airwear wrap works by delivering sustained gradient compression to the lower leg. Compression helps by mechanically squeezing the leg to improve blood flow and fluid return, thereby reducing swelling and other associated symptoms. However, traditional static compression therapy products (e.g. stockings, competitive wraps, bandages, etc.) are often difficult to apply, require precise application to achieve the desired pressure and are generally not user-friendly, resulting in poor user compliance. By utilizing an easy to apply hook and loop fastening system on the Airwear wrap, patients do not need to struggle with stockings or bandages to receive the compression therapy they require. In addition, a unique and patented inflation system enables consistent and precise pressure to be applied without professional application. While our other products have certain reimbursement-related requirements that can delay the receipt of a prescription for them, the Airwear wrap is not subject to those additional reimbursement requirements and therefore can be prescribed by a healthcare provider at the time of a patient’s visit, or the Airwear wrap can be obtained by patients over-the-counter without a prescription. The Airwear wrap can also be added as a complementary therapy option to our

Flexitouch Plus and Entre systems by providing lower extremity compression that can be worn throughout the day.
 Clinical Results and Studies    Overview 
 A key part of our success is our ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of our products by funding studies that generate clinical and economic outcome data supporting our products. We have developed a significant body of clinical data supporting the efficacy and safety of our products. We intend to continue to invest in additional studies to support peer-reviewed, published articles that evidence the clinical and economic benefits of our solutions as compared to traditional treatments. To date, 22 studies regarding the safety and efficacy of our products have been completed, in which over 2,100 subjects have been included. 
 Economic Impact of our Flexitouch System in Patients with Phlebolymphedema 
 A retrospective longitudinal matched case-control analysis of de-identified private insurance claims published by the Journal of Vascular Surgery in 2018 indicated significant benefits attributable to our Flexitouch system as compared to alternative compression therapies currently employed to help reduce the notable economic burden of phlebolymphedema (chronic venous insufficiency-related lymphedema). The study used administrative claims data from Blue Health Intelligence for the years 2012 through 2016. Patients were required to be continuously enrolled in the health plan for at least 18 months, diagnosed with phlebolymphedema, and had received at least one claim for conservative therapy either alone or in addition to a pneumatic compression device, or PCD. The main outcomes included direct phlebolymphedema- and sequelae-related medical resource utilization and costs. 
 Prior to case matching, 1,065 patients met these criteria. After case matching, the study included: 86 patients using conservative therapy matched with 87 patients on Flexitouch; 34 patients on simple PCDs, or SPCDs, matched with 23 patients on Flexitouch; and 69 patients on other advanced PCDs, or APCDs, matched with 67 patients on Flexitouch. Compared with conservative therapy alone, Flexitouch patients were associated with 69% lower per patient per year total phlebolymphedema- and sequelae-related costs net of any PCD-related costs ($3,839 vs $12,253; P=0.001). This was driven by 59% fewer mean annual hospitalizations (0.13 vs 0.32; P < 0.001) corresponding to 82% lower inpatient costs and 55% lower outpatient hospital costs. Flexitouch patients were also associated with 52% lower outpatient physical therapy and occupational therapy costs and 56% lower other outpatient-related costs. Compared with SPCDs, Flexitouch was associated with 85% lower total costs ($1,153 vs $7,449; P=0.008) driven by 93% lower inpatient costs ($297 vs $4,215; P=0.002), 84% lower outpatient hospital costs ($368 vs $2,347; P=0.020), and 85% lower other outpatient-related costs ($353 vs $2,313; P=0.023). Compared with other APCDs, Flexitouch was associated with 53% lower total costs ($3,973 vs $8,436; P=0.032) because of lower outpatient costs and lower rates of cellulitis infections (22.4% vs 44.9% of patients; P=0.02).
 Impact on Clinical Outcomes and Healthcare Costs with Use of our Flexitouch System 
 A retrospective study published by the American Medical Association in JAMA Dermatology demonstrated significant improvement in key clinical endpoints and immediate cost reductions for individuals with lymphedema following receipt of our Flexitouch system. The study was conducted in the United States and included 718 patients with a lymphedema diagnosis who had continuous insurance coverage during the 12 months prior to and the 12 months after receiving our Flexitouch system. 
 The study evaluated a broad, clinically relevant set of healthcare use outcomes for each patient for the 12 months before and the 12 months after receipt of our Flexitouch system, including cellulitis infections, inpatient hospitalizations, manual therapy and outpatient hospital visits. Receipt of our Flexitouch system was associated with a significant decline in the rate of cellulitis diagnosis in the cancer-related lymphedema patients of 79% (from 21.1% to 4.5%; p<.001) and in the non-cancer-related lymphedema patients of 75% (from 28.8% to 7.3%; p<.001). The inpatient hospitalization rate declined 22% in the cancer-related group (from 2.7% to 2.1%; p=.63) and declined 54% in the non-cancer-related group (from 7.0% to 3.2%; p=.02). The manual therapy rate decreased 30% in the cancer-related lymphedema patients (from 35.6% to 24.9%; p=.001) and

decreased 34% in the non-cancer-related lymphedema patients (from 32.3% to 21.2%; p=.001). In addition, outpatient hospital visits declined 29% in the cancer-related patients (from 58.6% to 41.4%; p<.001) and 40% in the non-cancer-related patients (from 52.6% to 31.4%; p<.001). 
 The study also reviewed lymphedema-related healthcare costs for each patient in the study for the 12 months before and the 12 months after receipt of our Flexitouch system. Among the cancer-related lymphedema patients, total costs per patient, excluding durable medical equipment costs, were reduced by 37%, from $2,597 to $1,642 (p=.002) following receipt of our Flexitouch system. The greatest contributor to this change was a 54% reduction in outpatient hospital costs from $1,517 to $694 (p<.001). Total costs per non-cancer-related lymphedema patients, excluding durable medical equipment costs, were reduced by 36% from $2,937 to $1,883 (p=.007). Outpatient hospital costs for the non-cancer patients declined by 65% from $1,726 to $606 (p<.001). 
 Flexitouch System Impact on Limb Volume and Patient-Reported Outcomes 
 A prospective study published in the European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery demonstrated that use of our Flexitouch system is associated with statistically significant reduction in limb volume, improvement in quality of life and no significant adverse effects. The study was conducted in the United States and collected data from a patient registry required by a third-party payer for 196 patients with lower extremity lymphedema who were prescribed our Flexitouch system from January 2009 to May 2012. The primary objective of the study was to examine the effectiveness of our Flexitouch system in reducing lower extremity limb volume, with a secondary objective of evaluating clinician-assessed and patient-reported outcomes. 
 Use of our Flexitouch system was associated with a statistically significant reduction in limb volume with 88% of patients experiencing a reduction in limb volume and with 35% enjoying a reduction in limb volume of greater than 10%. Twelve percent of patients experienced an increase in limb volume. Clinician assessment indicated that the majority of patients experienced improvement in the condition of their skin. 86% of the patients exhibited a reduction in skin hardening (fibrosis) based on manual assessment of the skin. Based on clinical observation of function, 85% of patients demonstrated an increased ability to perform activities of daily living. Additionally, 77% of patients demonstrated improved range of motion. 
 Patients reported a significant increase in their ability to control lymphedema through treatment with our Flexitouch system, with an increase in function and a reduction in pain. Of the 98 patients who responded, 66% reported being "very satisfied" with the treatment by our Flexitouch system and 29, or 30%, of patients reported being "satisfied" with the treatment by our Flexitouch system.
 Comparison of our Flexitouch System with Simple Pneumatic Compression Devices 
 A prospective, randomized controlled trial published in Supportive Care in Cancer demonstrated that our Flexitouch system provides better clinical outcomes as compared to those achieved with a simple pneumatic compression device for home-based treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema. The study was conducted in the United States and involved 36 patients. The number of participants in this study is considered to be a small sample size and a limitation of the study. However, it is one of the only published randomized controlled trials comparing PCDs, and we believe is currently the only published study of PCDs that reported comprehensively on adverse events. The patients were randomized to our Flexitouch system or a simple pneumatic compression device used for home treatment of one-hour per day for 12 weeks. The simple pneumatic compression device used in the study was a Bio Compression 2004 Sequential Circulator pneumatic compression device. The primary objective of the study was to determine whether our Flexitouch system provides better outcomes, as measured by arm edema and tissue water reductions, compared to a simple pneumatic compression device in patients with arm lymphedema. The study does not reflect a comparison of our Flexitouch system to a product that is billed under the same Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, or HCPCS, Code as our Flexitouch system. 
 Thirty-six patients with unilateral upper extremity lymphedema with at least 5% arm edema volume at the time of enrollment completed treatments over the 12-week period, with 26 patients being evaluated for edema volume change and 28 patients being evaluated for changes in arm tissue water content. Arm edema 

 
  11

 
volumes were determined from arm girth measurements and suitable model calculations, and tissue water was determined based on measurements of the arm tissue. The patients were randomized into two groups of 18 patients each, with one group receiving treatment with our Flexitouch system and the other group receiving treatment using a simple pneumatic compression device. The group using our Flexitouch system experienced an average reduction in edema of 29% compared to a 16% increase in the group using a simple pneumatic compression device. 
 Study of Patient-Reported Satisfaction with Use of our Flexitouch System 
 A retrospective study published in the Oncology Nursing Forum demonstrated that patients using our Flexitouch system were satisfied with the device and perceived it to be beneficial in managing their lymphedema. The study was conducted in the United States and involved 155 patients with lymphedema. The primary objective of the study was to compare treatment protocol adherence, satisfaction and perceived changes in emotional and functional status between patients with cancer-related lymphedema and non-cancer-related lymphedema using our Flexitouch system. 
 Ninety percent of the 155 study patients reported being "satisfied" with our Flexitouch system. Of these patients, more than 65% reported being "extremely satisfied." Further, 95% of patients reported a positive limb volume outcome, which was defined as a patient perceiving that limb volume had been maintained or reduced with device use. Of these patients, 42% reported limb volume decreases as much as 20%, and an additional 20% reported decreases of less than 20%. In addition, clinically and statistically significant improvements occurred in all areas of physical and emotional health (p < 0.006). 
 Flexitouch System Impact on Patient-Reported Improved Quality-of-Life 
 A prospective observational study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery demonstrated that use of our Flexitouch system is associated with patient-reported overall improvement in quality-of-life and lower extremity-related symptoms. The study was conducted in the United States and collected data from patients presenting for treatment of lower-extremity lymphedema from March 2011 to September 2014. A total of 100 consecutive patients with lower-extremity lymphedema met inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate improved quality-of-life in patients with lower-extremity lymphedema with Flexitouch system treatment. The secondary objective was to demonstrate reduced infectious complications of lymphedema with Flexitouch system treatment, and to determine the incidence of concomitant venous insufficiency in patients with lymphedema. 
 Use of our Flexitouch system was associated with overall improvement in lower extremity-related symptoms, with 54% of patients reporting greatly improved symptom control after use of our Flexitouch system, 35% moderately improved and 11% mildly improved. In the year before use of our Flexitouch system, 15% of the patients reported 26 episodes of cellulitis, which decreased to five episodes after initiation of the Flexitouch system (P = 0.002) in subsequent median follow-up of 12.7 months. Eight percent of patients reported skin ulceration of the affected extremity in the year before presentation for treatment. The number of lower-extremity ulcers pre- and post-Flexitouch system use decreased from seven to two (P = 0.007). Overall, 46% of the patients had complete limb girth measurements at the ankle and calf, and there was a statistically significant decreased overall limb girth after Flexitouch system treatment in pre- and post-ankle (28.3 cm vs. 27.5 cm, P = 0.01), and calf mean girths (44.7 cm vs. 43.8 cm, P = 0.018). In addition, venous reflux was present in 18% of patients, 14% and 4% within the superficial and deep venous system respectively. In patients with venous reflux, moderate to great improvement in symptoms was reported in 7% and 11%, respectively compared with 28% and 43% in patients without venous reflux (P = 0.257). 
 Comparison of Conventional Treatment for Venous Leg Ulcers with our Actitouch System 
 A prospective, randomized study published in the International Wound Journal demonstrated that our Actitouch system provides a comparable degree of effectiveness in venous leg ulcer healing to conventional treatment and an improved quality of life for patients. The study was conducted in the United States and Europe, involving a total of 90 patients over a 12-week period. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy, functionality, safety, patient perceptions and impact on patient quality of life of two compression methods for venous leg ulcers, including our Actitouch system and a traditional four-layer bandage system. Of 

 
  12

 
the 90 patients, 38 patients used our Actitouch system and 52 patients used a traditional four-layer bandage system. 
 The study demonstrated a comparable degree of effectiveness in venous leg ulcer healing, with healing rate differences not reaching statistical significance. The type and frequency of adverse events reported were similar between the treatment groups and there were no serious adverse events related to treatment in either group. In addition to demonstrating a comparable degree of effectiveness in venous leg ulcer healing, this study also demonstrated that using our Actitouch system yielded greater improvements in quality of life as compared to those using the bandage system. The only area that our Actitouch system did not rate higher than the bandage system was discreteness under clothing.
 Sales and Marketing 
 Unlike many of our competitors, we utilize a direct-to-patient and -provider model to market our solutions directly to patients and clinics, whereby we disintermediate the traditional durable medical equipment channel, providing high-quality customer service and capturing both the manufacturer and distributor margins. The below chart shows this disintermediation: 

 Our direct-to-patient and -provider model is composed of a direct sales force, contract at-home trainers, reimbursement capabilities and medical expertise to expand awareness, garner referrals and obtain payment for our products. As of December 31, 2018, we employed over 200 full-time sales representatives, including eight sales managers, who provide coverage throughout the United States. The below chart describes our U.S. direct-to-patient and -provider model.

 Our marketing team leads our efforts in brand development, product messaging, tradeshow attendance, educational forums, website development, social media and advertising.
 Reimbursement, Payer Relations and Customer Support Process 
 Private insurers and other payers represented approximately 71% and 74% of our revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively, while Veterans Administration hospitals represented 20% and 18% of our revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and Medicare represented approximately 9% and 8% of our revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively. When we sell our solutions directly to patients, we generally bill third-party payers, such as commercial insurance or Medicare, on behalf of our patients and bill the patient for their copayment obligations and deductibles. Any policy, regulatory or legislative developments that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause increasing downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would negatively affect our ability to generate the revenues necessary to support our business. For example, changes to the level of Medicare coverage for our products could reduce the number of Medicare patients who have access to our products. Changes to, or repeal of, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, could also potentially impact the number of patients who have access to our products. 
 As a nationwide provider, we have developed a broad expertise in obtaining billing codes, developing coverage policies, overcoming payer barriers and obtaining authorization and payment from payers across all regions of the United States. Our model utilizes our strategic and operational reimbursement proficiency to meet the varying requirements of hundreds of payers across the country. 
 Our Reimbursement Department, composed of over 70 employees, was reorganized in 2018 to improve operational efficiencies and enhance individual payer expertise, while continuing our strategic focus on payer development. The Reimbursement Department is now composed of our Payer Development and Reimbursement Operations groups. The Payer Development group is composed of both strategic and analytical teams with focus on payer decision-maker relationships and education, payer policy development and revision, payer contract negotiations, and payer data analysis. The Reimbursement Operations group, which is responsible for verifying patient insurance benefits, individual patient case development, prior authorization submissions, case follow-up and appeals when necessary, is organized into “payer lanes” so that each case is handled throughout the process by experts in specific payer requirements.
 We have strong and established payer relationships, including most of the largest private payers in the United States. Based on our estimates, we are contracted or enrolled as an in-network provider with payers covering over 275 million lives. These contracts allow us to be an in-network provider for patients, enabling them to access our systems at a competitive rate and copay comparable to other suppliers and easing our administrative burden in processing authorizations and claims. We have enjoyed a consistent commercial payer approval rate of greater than 80% for the last ten years, and a greater than 90% Medicare claims submitted approval rate (post-arbitration and based on the number of claims, not dollar amount of claims, submitted across all our products) since we began doing business with Medicare in 2007. We have an in-depth understanding of specific payer coverage criteria, and our submission materials are tailored to address individual payer's distinct requirements. Our dedicated customer service team is available to answer patient questions regarding reimbursement, account status, device operation and troubleshooting during normal business hours. We receive no additional reimbursement for patient support, but provide high-quality customer service and continuity of care to enhance patient comfort, satisfaction, compliance and safety with our products. 
 Our Flexitouch Plus system controller is reimbursed under HCPCS code E0652, and our Actitouch system and Entre system controllers are reimbursed under HCPCS code E0651. Garments that cover various parts of the body are used with these systems and billed using HCPCS codes E0667, E0668 and E0669. Our Airwear wrap is reimbursed under HCPCS code A6545. As of December 31, 2018, over 1,100 payers have paid for our products.

Research and Clinical Operations
 We are committed to ongoing research and development as part of our efforts to be at the forefront of physician and patient preference in the area of chronic disease, especially lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency. As of December 31, 2018, our research and development and clinical operations staff included more than 15 engineers, scientists, clinical monitors and project managers with expertise in trial management, pneumatics, electronics, garment design, embedded software, mechanical design, sensors and manufacturing technologies. Our research and development expenses, including spending on our clinical evidence development efforts, totaled $5.3 million and $5.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our current research and development efforts are focused primarily on increasing efficacy, improving design for ease-of-use, enhancing clinical functionality and reducing production costs of our solutions. Our clinical development efforts are focused on further differentiating our products from our competitors. We coordinate our development efforts with our intellectual property strategies in order to enhance our ability to obtain patent and other intellectual property protection.  Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 Our manufacturing and quality assurance model combines our internal manufacturing resources and expertise, including assembly, quality assurance, material procurement and inventory control, with approved third-party manufacturers and suppliers of system components. Our internal manufacturing activities, located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, include quality inspection, assembly, packaging, warehousing and shipping of our products. We outsource the manufacture of components, which are produced to our specifications and shipped to our facilities for inspection and final assembly. We use third-party manufacturers and suppliers worldwide to source our components, maintaining dual-source vendors of critical components whenever possible, and leveraging competitive bids among third-party manufacturers and suppliers to control costs. Quality control, risk management, efficiency and the ability to respond quickly to changing requirements are the primary goals of our manufacturing operations. We believe our manufacturing model permits us to operate with low capital expenditure requirements. We carefully manage our supply chain in an effort to take costs out of the manufacturing process. 
 We manage our arrangements with our third-party manufacturers and suppliers to adjust delivery schedules and quantities of components to match our changing manufacturing requirements. We forecast our component needs based on historical trends, current utilization patterns and sales forecasts of future demand. We establish our relationships with our third-party manufacturers and suppliers through supplier contracts and purchase orders. In most cases, these supplier relationships may be terminated by either party upon short notice. 
 In order to mitigate against the risks related to a single-source of supply, we qualify alternative suppliers, when possible, and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions, including maintaining adequate inventory of any single source components, along with requiring each supplier to maintain specified quantities of inventory. To date, we have not experienced material delays in obtaining any of our components, nor has the ready supply of finished products to our patients or clinicians been adversely impacted by component supply issues. 
 We have implemented a quality management system designed to comply with FDA regulations and International Standards Organization, or ISO, standards governing medical device products. In the United States, we and certain of our manufacturers are required to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping for our products. We maintain a quality management system to control compliance with such requirements and have procedures in place designed to ensure that all products and materials purchased by us conform to our requirements and FDA regulations. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 45 employees in operations, manufacturing and quality assurance. Our quality management system has been certified to ISO in 2012, 2014 and 2017, including ISO 13485:2003. Many of our manufacturers' quality management systems also have been certified to ISO.

 Order Fulfillment and Patient Education 
 Once we have a complete order and appropriate documentation from the payer, we package and ship a system, configured to their physician's prescription, directly to the patient. Our primary logistics partner is United Parcel Service, which we use for delivery and pick up of our devices. After delivery and when requested by our patient, we coordinate a visit from one of our over 560 licensed, independent contract trainers to provide education, clinical support or customer service. These trainers are healthcare professionals, licensed in their state of residence, who we have identified through our sales and marketing interest and instructed on proper use of our products. Patient visits are coordinated from our offices in Minneapolis and training sessions are assigned by our staff. Upon completion of the patient visit, the independent contractor submits an invoice to us for payment for the patient's training and their travel expenses. Competition 
 The pneumatic compression pump market is composed of a number of manufacturers and distributors of pneumatic compression pumps. Our most significant manufacturing competitor is Bio Compression Systems, Inc. Other competitors are Lympha Press USA, Devon Medical Products, Inc. and NormaTec Industries. If we expand internationally, we expect that Arjo AB would become a competitor, in addition to other potential international competitors. 
  Given the growth of the pneumatic compression pump market, we expect that the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future. Manufacturing companies compete for sales to patients primarily based on product features and service. 
 We believe we are the only pneumatic compression home-therapy device company with a meaningful U.S. market position supported by a direct sales force. We believe our manufacturing competitors' complete reliance on home medical equipment distribution intermediaries compresses their margins and limits their ability to invest in product features that address consumer preferences. To pursue a direct-to-patient and -provider sales model, our manufacturing competitors would need to meet national accreditation and state-by-state licensing requirements, secure Medicare billing privileges, as well as compete directly with the home medical equipment providers that many rely on across their entire home care businesses. 
 Some of our competitors and potential competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with greater resources than we have. As a consequence, they are able to spend more aggressively on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. Some of these competitors have: 

· | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


· | established relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | established distribution networks;
--+-----------------------------------


· | additional lines of products, the ability to offer rebates, bundle products to offer higher discounts or offer other incentives to gain a competitive advantage;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater history in conducting research and development, manufacturing, marketing and obtaining regulatory approval for homecare devices; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, patent litigation and customer financing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As a result, our current and future competitors may be able to find ways to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Therefore, even if our technology and direct-to-patient and -provider marketing strategy is more effective than the technology and marketing strategy of our competitors, current or potential customers might accept competitor products and services in lieu of purchasing our products. We anticipate that we will face increased 

 
  16

 
competition in the future as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved products and distribution strategies and as new companies enter the market with new technologies and distribution strategies. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations. Our ability to compete successfully and to increase our market share is dependent upon our reputation for providing responsive, professional and high-quality products and services and achieving strong customer satisfaction. Increased competition in the future could adversely affect our revenues, revenue growth rate, margins and market share.
 Government Regulation 
 Our systems are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA, and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. 
 FDA Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates medical devices, including the following activities that we perform, or that are performed on our behalf with respect to our devices: product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, premarket clearance or approval, record keeping, product marketing, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, and post-marketing surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The FDA can also refuse to clear or approve pending applications.
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we seek to distribute commercially in the United States requires marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes — Class I, Class II or Class III — based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device's safety and effectiveness. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices. Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries, or post-market surveillance. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general controls or if the device is a life-sustaining, life-supporting or a device of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which presents a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury and special controls are not adequate to assure safety and effectiveness. 
 Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from the FDA. Most Class II devices (and certain Class I devices that are not exempt) are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require premarket approval or 510(k) de novo clearance prior to commercial marketing. The premarket approval process is more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process. However, the 510(k) clearance process has also become increasingly stringent and expensive. 
 510(k) Clearance Pathway    When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is "substantially equivalent" to a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a premarket approval application, which is commonly known as the "predicate device." A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. In 2019, the FDA released an optional Safety and Performance Based Pathway for 510(k) clearance, which allows a 

 
  17

 
submitter to demonstrate that an eligible new device of a well-understood type meets FDA-identified performance criteria to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device. By law, the FDA is required to clear or deny a 510(k) premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously-cleared device or use, the FDA will issue a not substantially equivalent decision. This means the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process and will require marketing authorization through the premarket approval pathway. We obtained 510(k) clearance for our Flexitouch system in October 2006 and for a discontinued predecessor system in July 2002. In September 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the Flexitouch system for treating lymphedema of the head and neck. In June 2017, we announced that we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the Flexitouch Plus, the third-generation version of our Flexitouch system. We obtained 510(k) clearance for our Actitouch system in June 2013 and our Entre system in May 2015. 
 Premarket Approval Pathway    A premarket approval application must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The premarket approval application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process and requires the payment of significant user fees. A premarket approval application must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including but not limited to technical, pre-clinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of the device. 
 The FDA has 45 days from its receipt of a premarket approval application to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the FDA determines that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will accept the application and begin its in-depth review. The FDA has 180 days to review an "accepted" premarket approval application, although this process typically takes significantly longer and may require several years to complete. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulations. The FDA may delay, limit or deny approval of a premarket approval application for many reasons, including:

· | failure of the applicant to demonstrate that there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe or effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | insufficient data from the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the manufacturing processes, methods, controls or facilities used for the manufacture, processing, packing or installation of the device do not meet applicable requirements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If the FDA evaluations of both the premarket approval application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval order or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the premarket approval application. If the FDA's evaluation of the premarket approval application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the premarket approval application or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the premarket approval application. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the premarket approval application may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the premarket approval application. Once granted, the premarket approval application may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 Clinical Trials    Clinical trials are almost always required to support premarket approval and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States, these trials generally require submission of an 

 
  18

 
application for an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The FDA must approve the IDE in advance of trials for a specific number of patients unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements or the clinical investigation is exempt from the IDE regulations. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites. We, the FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval or clearance of the product. 
 FDA Ongoing Regulation    Even after a device receives clearance or approval by the FDA and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:

· | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or "off-label" uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation that may present a risk to health; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  After a device receives 510(k) clearance or a premarket approval, in general any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer's determination. We have modified various aspects of our systems since receiving regulatory clearance, but we believe that new 510(k) clearances are not required for these modifications. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties. 
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: Warning Letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, rescinding previously granted 510(k) clearances or withdrawing previously granted premarket approvals. 
 We are also subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. We were audited three times since January 2010 by the FDA and found to be in compliance with the Quality System Regulation. We cannot assure you that we can maintain a comparable level of regulatory compliance in the future at our facilities.

 FTC Regulation 
 Device advertising and promotional activity in certain circumstances is also subject to scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as similar state consumer protection agencies, which enforce laws related to false and deceptive trade practices. A company that is found to have advertised its product in violation of these laws may be subject to liability, including monetary penalties. 
 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, requires providers of product or services to attain and maintain accreditation in order to participate in federally funded healthcare programs. To attain and maintain accreditation, companies are required to institute policies and procedures that, among other things, formalize the interaction of the company with patients. Accrediting bodies that are approved by CMS will perform audits of these policies and procedures every three years. Should a company fall out of compliance with the requirements of the accrediting body, expulsion from the Medicare program could follow. In May 2008, we became a Durable, Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies accredited Medicare supplier by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care for our solutions. Our Medicare accreditation must be renewed every three years through passage of an on-site inspection. We last renewed our accreditation with Medicare in May 2017. Maintaining our accreditation and Medicare enrollment requires that we comply with numerous business and customer support standards. If we are found to be out of compliance with accreditation standards, our enrollment status in the Medicare program could be jeopardized, up to and including termination.  Licensure 
 Several states require that durable medical equipment providers be licensed in order to sell products to patients in that state. Certain of these states require that durable medical equipment providers maintain an in-state location. Most of our state licenses are renewed on an annual or bi-annual basis. Although we believe we are in compliance with all applicable state regulations regarding licensure requirements, if we were found to be noncompliant, we could lose our licensure in that state, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future products to patients in that state. In addition, we are subject to certain state laws regarding professional licensure. We believe that our certified clinicians are in compliance with all such state laws. If our clinicians were to be found non-compliant in a given state, we would need to modify our approach to providing education, clinical support and customer service in such state.  Fraud and Abuse Regulations 
 Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws.    The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, among other things, prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration, whether directly or indirectly and overtly or covertly, in return for, or to induce the referral of an individual for the:
· | furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any item or service reimbursable in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are a number of safe harbors to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Such safe harbors permit certain payments and business practices that, although they would otherwise potentially implicate the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, are not treated as an offense under the same if the requirements of the specific applicable safe harbor are met. 
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute applies to certain arrangements with healthcare providers, product end users and other parties, including marketing arrangements and discounts and other financial incentives offered to our clinicians in connection with the sales of our products. Although we believe that we have structured such arrangements to be in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute and other applicable laws, 

 
  20

 
regulatory authorities may determine that our marketing, pricing, or other activities violate the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws. Noncompliance with the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in civil, administrative and criminal penalties, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. In addition, to the extent we are found to not be in compliance, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and our results of operations. 
 The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, commonly known as the "Stark Law," prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain "designated health services" payable by Medicare to an entity, including a company that furnishes durable medical equipment, in which the physician or an immediate family member of such physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement unless an exception applies. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties and exclusion from Medicare or other governmental programs. Although we believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply with current Stark Law requirements, these requirements are highly technical and there can be no guarantee that regulatory authorities will not determine or assert that our arrangements do not meet applicable Stark Law exceptions. 
 Additionally, because some of these laws continue to evolve, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final form that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider arrangements may ultimately be found to be non-compliant with applicable federal law. 
 False statements.    The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or omitting a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of healthcare benefits, items, or services. In addition to criminal penalties, violation of this statute may result in collateral administrative sanctions, including exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. 
 Federal False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties Law.    The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim paid or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government or who has knowingly retained an overpayment. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring whistleblower lawsuits against companies. 
 The Civil Monetary Penalties Law provides, in part, that the federal government may seek civil monetary penalties against any person that, like under the Federal False Claims Act, presents or causes to be presented claims to a Federal health care program that the person knows or should know is for an item or services that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent or that has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim paid. The federal government may also seek civil monetary penalties for a wide variety of other conduct, including offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary's selection of providers and violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. 
 Although we believe that we are in compliance with the Federal False Claims Act as well as the Civil Monetary Penalties laws, if we are found in violation of the same, penalties include fines ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim violation of the Federal False Claims Act and varying amounts based on the type of violation of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law), plus up to three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. In addition, the federal government may also seek exclusion from participation in all federal health care programs. 
 In addition, we bill Medicare Part B and other insurers directly for each sale to patients. As a result, we must comply with all laws, rules and regulations associated with filing claims with the Medicare program, including the Social Security Act, Medicare regulations, the Federal False Claims Act and the Civil Monetary 

 
  21

 
Penalties Law, as well as a variety of additional federal and state laws. During an audit, insurers typically expect to find explicit documentation in the medical record to support a claim. Physicians and other clinicians, who are responsible for prescribing our products for patients, are expected to create and maintain the medical records that form the basis for the claims we submit to Medicare and other insurers. Any failure by physicians and other clinicians to properly document the medical records for patients using our products could invalidate claims, impair our ability to collect submitted claims and subject us to overpayment liabilities, Federal False Claims Act liabilities and other penalties including exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance programs. 
 To the extent we are found to not be in compliance, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and our results of operations. 
 State fraud and abuse provisions. Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and false claims acts that apply regardless of payer, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. In some states, these laws apply and we believe that we are in compliance with such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Other Anti-Corruption Laws.    We may be subject to a variety of domestic and foreign anti-corruption laws with respect to our regulatory compliance efforts and operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, commonly known as the FCPA, is a criminal statute that prohibits an individual or business from paying, offering, promising or authorizing the provision of money (such as a bribe or kickback) or anything else of value (such as an improper gift, hospitality, or favor), directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining, retaining, or directing business or other advantages (such as favorable regulatory rulings). The FCPA also obligates companies with securities listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions. Those provisions require a company such as ours to (i) maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions, expenses and asset dispositions, and (ii) devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are properly authorized, executed and recorded. The FCPA is subject to broad interpretation by the U.S. government. The past decade has seen a significant increase in enforcement activity. In addition to the FCPA, there are a number of other federal and state anti-corruption laws to which we may be subject, including, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 USC § 201 (which prohibits bribing U.S. government officials) and the U.S. Travel Act (which in some instances addresses private-sector or commercial bribery both within and outside the United States). Also, a number of the countries in which we conduct activities have their own domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010. There have been cases where companies have faced multi-jurisdictional liability under the FCPA and the anti-corruption laws of other countries for the same illegal act. 
 We could be held liable under the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws for the illegal activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, collaborators, agents, subsidiaries, or affiliates, even if we did not explicitly authorize such activity. Although we will seek to comply with anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, collaborators, agents, subsidiaries or affiliates will comply with these laws at all times. Violation of these laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain governments or other persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. In addition, our directors, officers, employees, and other representatives who engage in violations of the FCPA and certain other anti-corruption statutes may face imprisonment, fines and penalties. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management's attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 State and federal transparency/reporting requirements.    As part of the ACA, the Federal government has created a transparency program known as Open Payments (the Physician Payments Sunshine Act) which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies to report annually to the CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurate and complete information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for "knowing failures to report." Certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the device industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or prohibition and tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities. 
 The laws described above impact the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, healthcare professionals or other potential purchasers of our products. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or others that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 HIPAA.    The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, established uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, which are referred to as covered entities. The following standards have been promulgated under HIPAA's regulations:

· | the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, which restrict the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or "protected health information";
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Standards for Electronic Transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Security Standards, which require covered entities to implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard certain electronic health information, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the breach notification rules, which require covered entitles to provide notification to affected individuals, the Department of Health and Human Services and the media in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, which included sweeping changes to HIPAA, including an expansion of HIPAA's privacy and security standards. ARRA includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, which, among other things, made HIPAA's privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates of covered entities. A business associate is a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. As a result, business associates are now subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable standards. Moreover, HITECH creates a new requirement to report certain breaches of unsecured, individually identifiable health information and imposes penalties on entities that fail to do so. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.

 
  23

 

 The 2013 final HITECH omnibus rule, or the HITECH Final Rule, modifies the breach reporting standard in a manner that makes more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. Any liability from a failure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA or the HITECH Act could adversely affect our financial condition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The HITECH Final Rule will continue to be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us, as well as referring providers.
 In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in certain cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws. Most states have also adopted breach notification laws that require notification to affected individuals and certain state agencies if there is a security breach of certain individually-identifiable information. If we suffer a privacy or security breach, we could be required to expend significant resources to provide notification to the affected individuals and address the breach, as well as reputational harm associated with the breach. If we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions. Any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA, HITECH or state privacy and security statutes or regulations could adversely affect our financial condition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Environmental Regulation 
 Our research and development and manufacturing processes and operations involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including flammables, toxics and corrosives and produce hazardous chemical waste products. We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and end-of-life handling or disposition of products, and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Although the costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including requirements in the European Union relating to the restriction of use of hazardous substances in products, have not been material, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits. Also, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We do not currently maintain separate environmental liability coverage and any such contamination or discharge could result in significant cost to us in penalties, damages and suspension of our operations.  Foreign Government Regulation 
 International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain clearance or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may be different. Many countries also impose product standards, packaging requirements, environmental requirements, labeling requirements, and import restrictions on medical devices. Each country has its own tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject a company to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, criminal prosecution or other consequences. 
 The European Union is the primary regulator in Europe, which has adopted numerous directives and has promulgated voluntary standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Medical devices that comply with the requirements of applicable directives will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms with the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the member states of the European Union, and other countries that comply with or mirror these directives. The 

 
  24

 
method of assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the product, but typically involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a notified body, an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer's quality system, technical or design file and specific testing of the manufacturer's device. Such an assessment may be required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout these countries. Compliance establishes the presumption of conformity with the essential requirements for a CE Marking. We have the authorization to affix the CE Mark to our Flexitouch system and our Entre system and to commercialize these devices in the European Union. The notified body who inspected us issued our ISO 13485 certification in October 2014 and our EC-Certificate in December 2014. 
 In March 2012, we received our Medical Device License in Canada for our Flexitouch system. Before we are permitted to sell our devices in Canada, we must submit and obtain clearance of a license application, implement and comply with ISO Standard 13485, the Canadian Medical Device Regulations, and undergo an audit by a registrar accredited by Health Canada. 
 General Regulatory Compliance and Health Care Reform 
 The evolving regulatory and compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, financial condition and our results of operations. 
 In March 2010, the ACA was enacted into law in the United States. This healthcare reform, which included a number of provisions aimed at improving the quality and decreasing the cost of healthcare, has resulted in significant reimbursement cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals and other healthcare providers and in the healthcare reimbursement system, evolving toward value- and outcomes-based reimbursement methodologies. It is uncertain what long-term consequences these provisions will have on patient access to new technologies and what impacts these provisions will have on Medicare reimbursement rates. Other elements of the ACA, including comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board and payment systems reform, including shared savings pilots and other reforms, may result in fundamental changes to federal healthcare reimbursement programs. Changes to the ACA could impact the number of patients who have access to our products. Existing and additional legislative or administrative reforms, or any repeal of provisions, of the U.S. healthcare reimbursement systems may significantly reduce reimbursement or otherwise impact coverage for our medical devices, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of such systems in coverage or reimbursement issues could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
 Third-Party Reimbursement    In the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical devices depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement to providers and patients from third-party payers. Third-party payers include private insurance plans and governmental programs. As with other medical devices, reimbursement for our products can differ significantly from payer to payer, and our products are not universally covered by third- party commercial payers. Further, third-party payers continually review existing technologies for continued coverage and can, with limited notice, deny or reverse coverage for existing products. 
  Two principal governmental third-party payers in the United States are Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, certain disabled persons and others. In contrast, Medicaid is a medical assistance program jointly funded by federal and state governments to serve certain individuals and families with low incomes and who meet other eligibility requirements. Each state administers its own Medicaid program which determines the benefits made 

 
  25

 
available to the Medicaid recipients in that state. The Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and Medicaid. 
 CMS, which is the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that administers both Medicare and Medicaid, has the authority to decline to cover particular products or services if it determines that they are not "reasonable and necessary" for the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. A coverage determination for a product, which establishes the indications that will be covered, and any restrictions or limitations, can be developed at the national level by CMS through a National Coverage Determination, or NCD, or at the local level through a Local Coverage Determination, or LCD, by a regional Medicare Administrative Contractor, which is a private contractor that processes and pays claims on behalf of CMS for the geographic area where the services were rendered. Obtaining a coverage determination, whether an NCD or LCD, is a time-consuming, expensive and highly uncertain endeavor, especially for a new device. Under a NCD that has been effective since January 14, 2002, pneumatic compression devices, or PCDs, including our products, are covered for the treatment of lymphedema or for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency with venous stasis ulcers.  A LCD, administered by the four Medicare Administrative Contractors responsible for processing durable medical equipment claims, sets forth additional coverage criteria that impacts Medicare coverage for our products.  Our Medicare business has remained steady at 9% of revenue in 2018 compared to 8% in 2017.
 Because Medicare criteria is extensive, we have a team dedicated to educating prescribers to help them understand how Medicare policy affects their patients and the medical record documentation needed to meet both NCD and LCD requirements. We maintain open communication with physician key opinion leaders and with Medicare contractors to provide data as it becomes available that could potentially influence coverage decisions. We also continue to closely monitor our Medicare business to identify trends that could have a negative impact on certain Medicare patients' access to our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Commercial payers that reimburse for our products do so in a variety of ways, depending on the insurance plan's policies, employer and benefit manager input, and contracts with their provider network. Moreover, Medicaid programs and some commercial insurance plans, especially Medicare Advantage plans (commercial insurers that are administering Medicare benefits to certain beneficiaries), are frequently influenced by Medicare coverage determinations. In working with payers who follow Medicare criteria, we have focused on clear communications with insurers to ensure mutual understanding of criteria interpretation, which differs significantly among the plans from very restrictive to quite lenient, and we then work closely with prescribers to educate them accordingly. While this approach has had positive impact, we do not know if or when additional payers may adopt the LCD criteria nor do we know how they will choose to interpret it.
 We believe a reduction or elimination of coverage or reimbursement of our products by Medicare would likely cause some commercial third-party payers to implement similar reductions in their coverage or reimbursement of our products. If we are unable to expand coverage of our products by additional commercial payers, or if third-party payers that currently cover or reimburse for our products reverse or limit their coverage in the future, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property consists of patented designs and methods and proprietary know-how. In addition to the patented designs and methods discussed below, we have made significant investments in proprietary know-how, including the manufacture of fabrics and garments used in our systems and the algorithms used to manage the inflation and deflation of our systems and other functions of the controllers. To maintain and protect our proprietary technologies and products, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, and confidentiality provisions in our contracts. We have a policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, third parties and our advisors to protect our intellectual property and maintain our competitive position. We also require our employees and consultants to sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interest in intellectual property such as patents and copyrights arising from their work for us. We also require all employees to sign an agreement not to compete unfairly with us during their employment and upon termination of their employment through the misuse of confidential information, soliciting employees, and soliciting customers. Despite any measures taken 

 
  26

 
to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our systems or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. 
 On September 14, 2012, we completed an acquisition of certain assets, including inventory, equipment and tooling and patents for the Actitouch system and a technology known as SMM from ConvaTec, Inc. and ConvaTec Technologies, Inc., or the Sellers. In addition to $5.0 million of earlier payments, we were required to pay quarterly royalty payments to the Sellers through September 1, 2017 equal to 9% of sales for the Actitouch system and 7% of sales of SMM. For each quarterly calculation period beginning thereafter and ending on September 1, 2023, we are required to make quarterly payments to the Sellers equal to at least 6% of the sales of the Actitouch system and 5% of the sales of SMM. If Actitouch system and SMM sales in any calendar year beginning in 2018 exceed $40.0 million, the sales percentage amount relating to Actitouch system sales that we must pay shall equal 6% of the sales of the Actitouch system up to $40.0 million and 7% on the sales of the Actitouch system over $40.0 million. 
 Patents 
 Our patent portfolio consists of three sets of patents, including patents relating to our Flexitouch system, Actitouch system and other compression-related technologies, each of which is described in further detail below. As of December 31, 2018, we owned more than 150 issued patents globally, of which 27 were issued U.S. patents. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 65 patent applications pending globally, of which 27 were patent applications pending in the United States. Our U.S. issued patents have varying patent terms, expiring between 2022 and through at least 2033, subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges. U.S. patents covering various aspects of our Flexitouch system expired in 2017. Flexitouch System Patent Family
