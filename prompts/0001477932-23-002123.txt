Item 1. Business
Overview

We are a commercial stage biotechnology company dedicated to the advancement of identifying and translating novel biological therapeutics in the fields of immunotherapy, endocrinology, urology, neurology and orthopedics. Our platforms, therapies and products include the following:


Our subsidiary, Creative Medical Technologies, Inc. (“CMT”), was originally created to monetize U.S. Patent No. 8,372,797 and related intellectual property related to the treatment of erectile dysfunction (“ED”), which it acquired in February 2016. Subsequently, we have expanded our development and acquisition of intellectual property beyond urology to include therapeutic treatments utilizing “re-programmed” stem cells, and the treatment of neurologic disorders, lower back pain, Type-1 diabetes, and heart, liver, kidney, and other diseases using various types of stem cells through our ImmCelz, Inc., StemSpine, Inc. and AlloCelz LLC subsidiaries. However, neither ImmCelz Inc., nor AlloCelz LLC have commenced commercial activities.

We currently conduct substantially all of our commercial operations through CMT, which markets and sells our CaverStem® and FemCelz® disposable kits utilized by physicians to perform autologous procedures that treat erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction, respectively. Our CaverStem® and FemCelz® kits are currently available through physicians at eight locations in the United States.

In 2020, through our ImmCelz Inc. subsidiary, we began developing treatments that utilize a patient’s own extracted immune cells that are then “reprogrammed/supercharged” by culturing them outside the patient’s body with optimized cell-free factors. The immune cells are then re-injected into the patient from whom they were extracted. We believe this process endows the immune cells with regenerative properties that may be suitable for the treatment of multiple indications. In contrast to other stem cell-based approaches, the immune cells are significantly smaller in size than stem cells and are believed to more effectively penetrate areas of the damaged tissues and induce regeneration. In March 2022 we contracted with The University of Miami and the Diabetes Research Institute to further develop, test and manufacture our ImmCelz technology. Results, products and all intellectual property related to this work is owned by the Company.

In June 2022, we signed an agreement with Greenstone Biosciences Inc. for the development of a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) pipeline for our ImmCelz® platform. This project was identified as iPScelz™. The efforts by Greenstone Biosciences Inc. are expected to complement and expand our current work on novel therapeutic cell lines. All data, products and intellectual property related to this work is owned by the Company.

In October 2022, we announced the development of our AlloStem™ Clinical Cell Line, a proprietary allogenic cell line which includes a Master Cell Bank and a Drug Master File which we intend to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for registration. We believe we will able to use this cell line for many of our programs, including our ImmCelz® immunotherapy platform for multiple diseases, OvaStem® for Premature Ovarian Failure, CELZ-201 for Type 1 diabetes, StemSpine® for lower back pain, and IPScelz ™ perinatal stem cell program in ongoing development with Greenstone Biosciences.

In November 2022, we announced that the FDA had cleared the Company’s AlloStem™ (CELZ-201) Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes, which will allow us to begin a Phase I/II clinical trial. The primary objective of the study (CELZ-201) will be to evaluate AlloStem™ in patients with newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes. Patient recruitment is expected to begin in 2023.

In addition to our clinical research efforts, we are currently seeking to expand the commercial sale and use of our CaverStem® and FemCelz® products by physicians in the United States. 

We were incorporated on December 3, 1998, in the State of Nevada under the name Jolley Marketing, Inc. On May 18, 2016, we completed a reverse merger transaction under which Creative Medical Technologies, Inc. became our wholly owned subsidiary. In connection with this merger, we changed our name to Creative Medical Technologies Holdings, Inc. to reflect our current business. 

On December 7, 2021, we received gross proceeds of $16,003,750, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of seven percent (7%) and offering expenses, upon the closing of a public offering of 3,875,000 shares of our common stock, and accompanying warrants to purchase 3,875,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.13 per share (“Warrants”), at a combined public offering price to the public of $4.13 per share of common stock and related Warrant. We used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to (i) redeem 15% Original Issue Discount Senior Notes in the aggregate outstanding amount of $5,146,176, and (ii) repurchase Series A Preferred Stock from our Chief Executive Officer for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $195,000. We intend to use the remaining proceeds from the offering to (i) hire marketing and sales personnel to support sales of our CaverStem® and FemCelz® products, (ii) proceed with a clinical study of 100 patients intended to support the safety and efficacy of our StemSpine® Regenerative Stem Cell Procedure for Treatment of Degenerative Disc Disease, (iii) conduct a Phase I clinical trial for the treatment of stroke utilizing our ImmCelzTM technology, (iv) continue to develop other products and therapies, and (v) fund working capital and general corporate purposes using any remaining amounts.

On May 3, 2022 we received gross proceeds of $17,000,000, before deducting placement agent fees and expenses, upon the closing of an unregistered sale of equity securities of (i) 2,991,669 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 4,563,887 shares of common stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), and (ii) accompanying warrants to purchase 15,111,112 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share (“Warrants”), at a combined offering price of $2.25 per share of common stock/Pre-Funded Warrant and related Warrant, to a group of institutional investors (the “Purchasers”). The Warrants have a five-year term, and an exercise price of $2.00 per share. The Pre-Funded Warrants do not expire and had an exercise price of $0.0001 per share. Roth Capital Partners acted as sole placement agent for the offering. We paid Roth a placement agent fee in the amount of $1,360,000 and issued Roth a warrant to purchase 1,133,333 shares of common stock with the same terms as the Warrants issued to the Purchasers. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company and the Purchasers entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register the resale of the shares of Common Stock issued in the offering and the shares of Common Stock underlying the Common Warrants and Pre-Funded Warrants. On May 10, 2022, we filed a Form S-3 registration statement to register the shares, common stock, Warrants and Pre-Funded Warrants for resale. The registration went effective on May 19, 2022, fulfilling our contractual obligation. In addition, the Company’s directors and officers entered into Lock-Up Agreements under which they agreed not to sell any of their securities of the Company until 90 days following after the earliest of (i) the effective date of the Registration Statement, and (ii) the date all of the securities issued in the offering have been sold under Rule 144, or may be sold under Rule 144 without the Company being in compliance with the current public information requirement under such rule, and without any volume limitation. From June through July 2022, all of the Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised for shares of common stock.

Our principal executive offices are located at 211 E Osborn Road, Phoenix, AZ 85012.

Our Products

CaverStem® - Erectile Dysfunction Treatment

CaverStem® is a clinically proven, patented procedure (U.S. Patent No. 8,372,797) that utilizes a patient’s own stem cells to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). The procedure has been demonstrated safe and effective in clinical trials and is geared to the estimated nine million men in the United States that suffer from ED and do not respond to PDE5 inhibitors in drugs such as Viagra and Cialis due to damage to smooth muscle and blood vessels. 

Our CaverStem® stem cell treatment consists of a one-hour out-patient visit in a physician’s office. The physician harvests a patient’s stem cells from bone marrow in the hip using a local anesthetic. The extraction device is designed to harvest only the stem cells, while filtering out the red blood cells, thereby eliminating the need for any centrifugation. The stem cells are then injected into the patient’s corpus cavernosum (erectile tissue) to stimulate muscle and blood vessel regeneration. Clinical research data concludes that our CaverStem® treatment results in a marked increase in duration and frequency of erections and the ability to sustain erections until orgasm, with no known treatment-associated adverse events.

We generate revenues through the sale of disposable bone marrow aspiration kits to physicians who use the kits to perform the CaverStem® procedure. We contract with physicians to purchase kits and, in turn, provide exclusivity in their market through our patent protection, marketing support and training. 

Our CaverStem® technology is protected by U.S. Patent No. 8,372,797, entitled “Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction by Stem Cell Therapy” which was issued to CMH by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) on February 12, 2013. We acquired this patent and related know-how and technology from CMH in May 2016. CaverStem® is also a U.S. registered trademark (Reg. No. 5716528). 

In August 2017, we completed recruitment on a clinical trial of the CaverStem® procedure conducted by the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Following completion of recruitment and treatment of the study subjects, an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) overseeing the study validated the procedure as safe. In the same time frame, other worldwide, peer-reviewed and published clinical trials using the same procedure validated the efficacy of the ED treatment. As a result of these two developments, management concluded the CaverStem® procedure is both safe and effective and commenced marketing activities in November of 2017. From November 2017, through September 2020, the data from 40 patients in the clinical trial was combined with data from a 100-patient clinical registry and analyzed. The results were then submitted to the Journal of Translational Medicine for peer-review and publication and subsequently published in its January 2020 edition. The peer-reviewed results validated 100% safety and 85% efficacy of the CaverStem® procedure. This marked the largest ever study of the safety and efficacy of bone marrow stem cells used to treat erectile dysfunction.

FemCelz® - Female Sexual Function Treatment

In September 2018, we launched our proprietary FemCelz® procedure for the treatment of the loss of genital sensitivity and dryness experienced by women. The FemCelz® procedure uses the patient’s own stem cells to improve female sexual function, and is similar to the CaverStem® procedure. Management has determined that FemCelz® is exempt from the FDA premarket review and approval process under Section 361 of the PHS Act, as the procedure involves the autologous treatment of a patient with her own cells during the same surgical procedure without intervening processing steps.

Our FemCelz® stem cell treatment consists of a one-hour out-patient visit in a physician’s office. The physician harvests a patient’s stem cells from bone marrow in the hip using a local anesthetic. The extraction device is designed to harvest only the stem cells, while filtering out the red blood cells, thereby eliminating the need for any centrifugation. The cells are then injected into the pubocervical fascia (peri-G-spot), skene’s glands, and around the peri-clitoral to stimulate muscle and blood vessel regeneration.

FemCelz® is a U.S. registered trademark (Reg. No. 6107881). 

StemSpine® - Regenerative Stem Cell Procedure for the Treatment of Degenerative Disc Disease (Clinical Trials)

Our StemSpine® procedure uses the patient’s own stem cells to reverse the effects of atherosclerosis and treat chronic lower back pain. A recent study reported that an estimated 2.6 million patients in the U.S. will have suffered from degenerative disc disease in 2021, with the number increasing to close to four million patients in 2028. 

Management has determined that StemSpine® is exempt from the FDA premarket review and approval process under Section 361 of the PHS Act, as the procedure involves the autologous treatment of a patient with his or her own cells during the same surgical procedure without intervening processing steps. 

Our StemSpine® stem cell treatment consists of a one-hour out-patient visit in a physician’s office. The physician harvests a patient’s stem cells from bone marrow in the hip using a local anesthetic. The extraction device is designed to harvest only the stem cells, while filtering out the red blood cells, thereby eliminating the need for any centrifugation. The cells are then administered into muscles surrounding the area of lower back pain, such as the psoas major muscle to stimulate blood vessel regeneration. New blood vessels increase circulation around the disc and thus stimulates regeneration of the disc.

Lower back pain is the single leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting mobility, functionality, and the emotional state. To date, treatment options have ranged from prescription medication, to physical therapy and even acupuncture. Unfortunately, in patients whose lower back pain originates from disc degeneration, existing approved treatments do not address the underlying cause, but only symptoms.

Recent U.S. clinical trials using stem cells administered directly into the disc have shown promise in regenerating injured discs, and by this means reducing pain in some patients. Companies such as Mesoblast Limited have patient follow-ups as long as three years post injection and show some degree of pain reduction and disc regeneration without adverse effects.

A significant number of patients suffering from lower back pain have deficient circulation in the areas surrounding the discs, which is believed by some to be the initial cause of disc degeneration. Our StemSpine® technology utilizes biologicals to stimulate a process termed angiogenesis, which overcomes the deficient circulation causing disc degeneration.

In May 2017, we formed StemSpine, LLC for the purpose of using stem cells to treat back pain under a patent we acquired from CMH. In June 2017, we filed an additional patent application covering the synergy between intradiscal stem cell injection subsequent to stimulation of perispinal angiogenesis.

In October 2019, we announced the successful completion of a pilot study of 15 patients with over 12 months of data showing safety and efficacy. Evaluation of patients at 30, 60 90, 180, and 360 days revealed significant improvement in mobility and reduction in pain score. The mean pain score (on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being most severe), changed from 8.9 at baseline to 4.3 at 30 days, and sustained to 1.8 at 6 months and 1.3 at 12 months, with a gradual reduction in overall pain medication utilization guided by patients’ healthcare teams. No serious adverse effects were noted, with some short-term bruising in two patients at the harvest site. No long-term adverse events were reported related to the procedure.

On February 14, 2023, we announced positive three-year follow-up data for the Company's StemSpine® pilot study. The three-year data demonstrate continued efficacy of the StemSpine® procedure for treating chronic lower back pain without any serious adverse effects reported. There were no safety related concerns at up to three years, and the StemSpine® procedure resulted in a continued efficacy rate of 87% of patients that participated in the pilot study. No patients required re-dosage or surgical intervention since the last follow-up at two years.

StemSpine® is a U.S. registered trademark (Reg. No. 5997521).

ImmCelz™ - Personalized Supercharged Immune Therapy (Pre-Clinical Trials)

We are developing our ImmCelz™ technology for the treatment of multiple indications. 

ImmCelz™ utilizes a patient’s own extracted immune cells that are then “reprogrammed” by culturing them outside the patient’s body with optimized secreted factors. The immune cells are then re-injected into the patient from whom they were extracted. In contrast with other stem cell-based approaches, the immune cells are significantly smaller in size than stem cells and are believed to more effectively penetrate areas of the damaged tissues and induce regeneration. 

Unlike our CaverStem®, FemCelz® and StemSpine® procedures, because the patient’s cells are reprogrammed/supercharged prior to reinjection, we will require FDA approval before we can market or sell ImmCelz™. 

We developed ImmCelz™ initially using co-culture techniques which have now been advanced to a cell-free culture system. We have also utilized certain cell-free factors pursuant to a license agreement we entered into with Jadi Cell LLC, which is owned and controlled by Dr. Patel. We have been granted the right to exploit Jadi Cell’s patent rights (including U.S. Patent Number 9,803,176 and similar patents issued by other countries) and proprietary know how in connection with the enhancement of autologous cells. However, based on our current development of the ImmCelz™ platform, we have engineered the next generation of cell-free secreted factors which are independent of the Jadi Cell LLC license. We continue to have the previously licensed platform from Jadi Cells LLC for the first generation ImmCelz™.

We have filed an application with the USPTO to trademark ImmCelzTM (Ser. No. 88829362). 

OvaStem™ - Stem Cell Therapy for Premature Ovarian Failure

We are developing our OvaStem™ technology for the treatment of female infertility. Our treatment is intended to treat women suffering from infertility induced by factors such as chemotherapy and other non-natural causes, as well as age-associated infertility, and infertility with unexplained causes. In these cases, IVF treatment may not be appropriate as the woman’s ovaries are not able to generate eggs capable of being fertilized. Studies have shown that the introduction of stem cells into dysfunctional ovaries induce fertility, reduce ovarian fibrosis, accelerate maturation of immature oocytes, and restore growth factor production damaged by aging and cancer interventions. Accordingly, we believe that our OvaStem™ procedure may be a suitable treatment for these women with damaged ovaries.

The OvaStem™ stem cell treatment will consist of a one-hour out-patient visit in a physician’s office. The physician will harvest a patient’s stem cells from bone marrow in the hip using a local anesthetic. The extraction device will harvest only the stem cells, while filtering out the red blood cells, thereby eliminating the need for any centrifugation. The cells would then be administered into the dysfunctional ovaries. 

Like our CaverStem® and FemCelz® procedures, because OvaStem™ will utilize a patient’s own extracted immune cells, management has determined that OvaStem™ will be exempt from the FDA premarket review and approval process under Section 361 of the PHS Act, as the procedure involves the autologous treatment of a patient with her own cells during the same surgical procedure without intervening processing steps.

On July 28, 2022, we announced positive three-year follow up data for the Company's OvaStem® pilot study.  The data shows significant efficacy of the OvaStem® procedure for the treatment of medical refractory Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) without any serious adverse effects and the successful birth of healthy babies.

                To date, we have not made any payments to Jadi Cell under this agreement, other than the $250,000 initial license fee, which we paid by the issuance of 180,180 shares of common stock to Jadi Cell in February 2022. 

Trademarks

We have obtained trademark registration for CaverStem®, StemSpine® and FemCelz®, and have trademark applications pending for ImmCelz™, OvaStem™, iPScelz™, AlloStem™ and Alova™.

Competition

We compete with many pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies, as well as other private and public stem cell companies involved in the development and commercialization of cell-based medical technologies and therapies. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing and personnel resources than we do. We cannot forecast when or if these companies are likely to bring their products and therapies to market in competition with our products and therapies or those that we are pursuing. Regenerative medicine is rapidly progressing, in large part through the development of cell-based therapies or devices designed to isolate cells from human tissues. Most efforts involve cell sources, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, embryonic and fetal tissue, umbilical cord and peripheral blood and skeletal muscle.

While there are a number of public and private companies that market and sell treatments for erectile dysfunction, our CaverStem® procedure is targeted at men who, due to damage to the blood vessels and smooth muscle tissue in the penis, do not respond to PDE5 inhibitors such as Viagra or Cialis. For these men, the only widely available treatment is invasive, non-reversible rod or pump implantation into the penis, or the painful injection into the penis of drugs containing alprostadil. Currently, we believe there are fewer than a dozen private clinics in the U.S. that offer autologous stem cell treatments for erectile dysfunction. None of these firms is believed to have filed for patent protection or conducted clinical trials using bone marrow to validate safety and efficacy as we have.

Similarly, while there are many treatments available for female sexual dysfunction, we are not aware of any competitor for our FemCelz® procedure that uses or proposes to use autological stem cells to treat female sexual dysfunction, nor are we aware of any potential competitor for OvaStem™ that uses or proposes to use autologous stem cells to treat women with damaged ovaries who do not respond to available medications.

Companies working in the area of regenerative medicine with regard to the disc and spine include, among others, Mesoblast, SpinalCyte, BioRestorative Therapies, DiscGenics and Isto Biologics. Companies working in the area of regenerative medicine to treat stroke victims include Athersys, Inc., among others, although our competitors’ treatments are injected into the disc, and our treatment is injected around the disc.

Government Regulation

U.S. Government Regulation

The health care industry is highly regulated in the United States. The federal government, through various departments and agencies, state and local governments, and private third-party accreditation organizations, regulate and monitor the health care industry, associated products, and operations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, manufacture, distribution, and marketing of medical products, including drugs, biologics, and medical devices. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, advertising, promotion, sampling and import and export of medical products. The following is a general overview of the laws and regulations pertaining to our business.
FDA Regulation of Stem Cell Treatment and Products

The FDA regulates the manufacture of human stem cell treatments and associated products under the authority of the Public Health Service Act (or PHS Act), and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (or FDCA). Stem cells can be regulated under the FDA’s Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products Regulations, referred to as HCT/Ps, or may also be subject to the FDA’s drug, biologic, or medical device regulations, each as discussed below.
Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products Regulation

Under Section 361 of the PHS Act, the FDA issued specific regulations governing the use of HCT/Ps in humans. Pursuant to Part 1271 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, or the HCT/P Regulations, the FDA established a unified registration and listing system for establishments that manufacture and process HCT/Ps. The regulations also include provisions pertaining to donor eligibility determinations; current good tissue practices covering all stages of production, including harvesting, processing, manufacture, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution; and other procedures to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases.

The HCT/P Regulations define HCT/Ps as articles “containing or consisting of human cells or tissues that are intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion or transfer into a human recipient.” The HCT/P Regulations strictly constrain the types of products that may be regulated solely as an HCT/P. Factors considered include the degree of manipulation, whether the product is intended for a homologous function, whether the product has been combined with noncellular or non-tissue components, and the product’s effect or dependence on the body’s metabolic function. In those instances where cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products have been only minimally manipulated, are intended strictly for homologous use, have not been combined with noncellular or nontissue substances, and do not depend on or have any effect on the body’s metabolism, the manufacturer is only required to register with the FDA, submit a list of manufactured products, and adopt and implement procedures for the control of communicable diseases. If one or more of the above factors has been exceeded, the product would be regulated as a drug, biological product, or medical device rather than an HCT/P.

In addition, pursuant to the “Same Surgical Procedure Exception” under Section 1271.15(b) of the HCT/P Regulations, the FDA has provided guidance that exempts HCT/Ps from Section 361 of the PHS Act where autologous cells are removed from an individual and implanted into the same individual during a single surgical procedure without intervening processing steps. The FDA’s rationale is that this type of procedure raises no additional risks beyond that typically associated with surgery. Management has determined that our CaverStem® and FemCelz® procedures and therapies are exempt from the FDA premarket review and approval process and other HCT/P Regulations under the Same Surgical Procedure Exception, and that our StemSpine® and OvaStem™ procedures and therapies will be similarly exempt. Conversely, because our ImmCelz™ therapy will treat a patient’s stem cells with Jadi Cells before being injected back into the patient, we will need to obtain FDA regulatory approval for ImmCelz™ in the same manner as a standard drug, as described below.

If the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions including public warning letters, fines, consent decrees, orders of retention, recall or destruction of product, orders to cease manufacturing, and criminal prosecution. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.

Drug and Biological Product Regulation

An HCT/P product that does not meet the criteria for being solely regulated under Section 361 of the PHS Act will be regulated as a drug, device or biological product under the FDCA and/or Section 351 of the PHS Act, and applicable FDA regulations. The FDA has broad regulatory authority over drugs and biologics marketed for sale in the United States. The FDA regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, and production of drugs and biological products. The FDA also regulates the export of drugs and biological products manufactured in the United States to international markets in certain situations.

The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:


· | completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practice (or GLP), or other applicable regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | submission of an IND, which allows clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days; 
· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its intended use or uses conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and Good Clinical Practices (or GCP), which are international ethical and scientific quality standards meant to ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected and that the integrity of the data is maintained;
· | registration of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products and certain clinical trial information; 
· | preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application (or NDA), in the case of a drug or biologics license application (or BLA) in the case of a biologic; 
· | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
· | satisfactory completion of pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and of selected clinical trial sites to assess compliance with GCP requirements; and 
· | FDA approval of an NDA or BLA which must occur before a drug or biologic can be marketed or sold. 


Approval of an NDA requires a showing that the drug is safe and effective for its intended use and that the methods, facilities, and controls used for the manufacturing, processing, and packaging of the drug are adequate to preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity. To obtain a BLA, a manufacturer must show that the proposed product is safe, pure, and potent and that the facility in which the product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets established quality control standards.

For purposes of an NDA or BLA approval by the FDA, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following phases (which may overlap):


· | Phase 1: The investigational product is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. These trials may also provide early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


14


· | Phase 2: These clinical trials are conducted in a limited number of human subjects in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the investigational product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and dosage levels. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Phase 3: Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken after Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the investigational product appears effective and has a tolerable safety profile. The Phase 2 clinical trials must also provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety risks in an expanded human subject population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness, and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk profile of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of an investigational drug or biologic.


All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, GCP requirements and their protocols in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. These government regulations may delay or prevent approval of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our business operations.

The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials, referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, after a product is approved. Such trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA has authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency.

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA, or an NDA or BLA supplement, before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA and BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs and BLAs.

Drug and biological products must also comply with applicable requirements, including monitoring and recordkeeping activities, manufacturing requirements, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling, or off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may, in their independent professional medical judgment, prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers typically may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling, or changes of the site of manufacture, are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, who may or may not grant approval or may include a lengthy review process.

In the event that the FDA does not regulate our product candidates in the United States solely under the HCT/P regulation, our products and activities could be regulated as drug or biological products under the FDCA. If regulated as drug or biological products, we will need to expend significant resources to ensure regulatory compliance. If an IND and NDA or BLA are required for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance as to whether or when we will receive FDA approval of the product candidate. The process of designing, conducting, compiling, and submitting the non-clinical and clinical studies required for NDA or BLA approval is time-consuming, expensive, and unpredictable. The process can take many years, depending on the product and the FDA’s requirements.


15


In addition, even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution or use, or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, including safety labeling or imposition of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, the requirement to conduct post-market studies or clinical trials or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for our products, or obtaining approval but for significantly limited use, would harm our business. Further, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future United States or foreign governmental action.

If the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.

FDA Expedited Review Programs

The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of NDAs and BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Drug and biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied.

In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track NDA or BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for the following other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review:


· | Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative, and cross-disciplinary review, and rolling review. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition compared to marketed products. The FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to ten months for standard review. 
· | Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials.

Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

Further, with the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT (which may include a cell therapy), that is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a RMAT designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.

Medical Device Regulation

The FDA also has broad authority over the regulation of medical devices marketed for sale in the United States. The FDA regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, promotion, distribution, and production of medical devices. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets.

Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes, Class I, Class II, or Class III, depending upon the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to the lowest degree of regulatory scrutiny because they are considered low risk devices and need only comply with the FDA’s General Controls. The General Controls include compliance with the registration, listing, adverse event reporting requirements, and applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation as well as the general misbranding and adulteration prohibitions.

Class II devices are subject to the General Controls as well as certain Special Controls such as 510(k) premarket notification. Class III devices are subject to the highest degree of regulatory scrutiny and typically include life supporting and life sustaining devices and implants. They are subject to the General Controls and Special Controls that include a premarket approval application, or PMA. “New” devices are automatically regulated as Class III devices unless they are shown to be low risk, in which case they may be subject to de novo review to be moved to Class I or Class II. Clinical research of an investigational device is subject to the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Nonsignificant risk devices are subject to abbreviated requirements that do not require a submission to the FDA but must have Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and comply with other requirements pertaining to informed consent, labeling, recordkeeping, reporting, and monitoring. Significant risk devices require the submission of an IDE application to the FDA and the FDA’s approval of the IDE application.

The FDA premarket clearance and approval process can be lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. It generally takes three to twelve months from submission to obtain 510(k) premarket clearance, although it may take longer. Approval of a PMA could take one to four years, or more, from the time the application is submitted and there is no guarantee of ultimate clearance or approval. Securing FDA clearances and approvals may require the submission of extensive clinical data and supporting information to the FDA. Additionally, the FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing and promotion of devices for indications or uses that have not been cleared or approved by the FDA. In addition, modifications or enhancements of products that could affect the safety or effectiveness or effect a major change in the intended use of a device that was either cleared through the 510(k) process or approved through the PMA process may require further FDA review through new 510(k) or PMA submissions.

In the event we develop processes, products or services which qualify as medical devices subject to FDA regulation, we intend to comply with such regulations. If the FDA determines that our products are regulated as medical devices and we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, application integrity proceedings, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.

Current Good Manufacturing Practices and other FDA Regulations of Cellular Therapy Products

Products that fall outside of the HCT/P regulations and are regulated as drugs, biological products, or devices must comply with applicable cGMP regulations. These cGMPs and related quality standards are designed to ensure the products that are processed at a facility meet the FDA’s applicable requirements for identity, strength, quality, sterility, purity, and safety. In the event that our domestic United States operations are subject to the FDA’s drug, biological product, or device regulations, we intend to comply with the applicable cGMPs and quality regulations.

If the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act—Protection of Patient Health Information

We may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain types of individuals and organizations. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and from HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Further, we may need to also comply with additional federal or state privacy laws and regulations that may apply to certain diagnoses, such as HIV/AIDS, to the extent that they apply to us.

The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, through its Office for Civil Rights, investigates breach reports and determines whether administrative or technical modifications are required and whether civil or criminal sanctions should be imposed. Companies failing to comply with HIPAA and the implementing regulations may also be subject to civil money penalties or in the case of knowing violations, potential criminal penalties, including monetary fines, imprisonment, or both. In some cases, the State Attorneys General may seek enforcement and appropriate sanctions in federal court. 

Other Applicable U.S. Laws

In addition to the above-described regulation by United States federal and state government, the following are other federal and state laws and regulations that could directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate the business:

· | state and local licensure, registration, and regulation of the development of pharmaceuticals and biologics;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | state and local licensure of medical professionals; 
· | state statutes and regulations related to the corporate practice of medicine; 
· | other laws and regulations administered by the FDA; 
· | other laws and regulations administered by HHS; 
· | state and local laws and regulations governing human subject research and clinical trials; 


18


· | the federal physician self-referral prohibition, also known as Stark Law, and any state equivalents to Stark Law; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the federal False Claims Act, or FCA; 
· | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, and any state equivalent statutes and regulations; 
· | federal and state coverage and reimbursement laws and regulations; 
· | state and local laws and regulations for the disposal and handling of medical waste and biohazardous material; 
· | Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, regulations, and requirements; 
· | the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (in the event that our products are classified as drugs, biologics, devices, or medical supplies and are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program); 
· | state and other federal laws addressing the privacy of health information; and 
· | state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare professionals and other potential referral sources, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare professionals or marketing expenditures, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.


Violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products. 

Foreign Government Regulation

In general, we will need to comply with the government regulations of each individual country in which our products are to be distributed and sold. These regulations vary in complexity and can be as stringent, and on occasion even more stringent, than FDA regulations in the United States. Due to the fact that there are new and emerging cell therapy regulations that have recently been drafted and/or implemented in various countries around the world, the application and subsequent implementation of these new and emerging regulations have little to no precedence. Therefore, the level of complexity and stringency is not always precisely understood for each country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process. Furthermore, government regulations can change with little to no notice and may result in up-regulation of our product(s), thereby creating a greater regulatory burden for our cell processing technology products. We have not yet thoroughly explored the applicable laws and regulations that we will need to comply with in foreign jurisdictions. It is possible that we may not be permitted to expand our business into one or more foreign jurisdictions.
Employees

We currently employ four people on a full-time basis and multiple consultants on a part-time basis. None of our employees belong to a union. We believe relations with our employees are good.
