ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
General 
 Popular is a diversified, publicly-owned financial holding company, registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act) and subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board). Popular was incorporated in 1984 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and is the largest financial institution based in Puerto Rico, with consolidated assets of $47.6 billion, total deposits of $39.7 billion and stockholders equity of $5.4 billion at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, we ranked among the 50 largest U.S. bank holding companies based on total assets according to information gathered and disclosed by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 We operate in two principal markets: 
  Puerto Rico: We provide retail, mortgage and commercial banking services through our principal banking subsidiary, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (Banco Popular or BPPR), as well as auto and equipment leasing and financing, investment banking, broker-dealer and insurance services through specialized subsidiaries. BPPRs deposits are insured under the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The banking operations of BPPR are primarily based in Puerto Rico, where BPPR has the largest retail banking franchise. BPPR also conducts banking operations in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands and New York. 
  Mainland United States: We provide retail, mortgage and commercial banking services through our New York-chartered banking subsidiary, Popular Bank (PB), which has branches in New York, New Jersey and Florida. PBs deposits are insured under the DIF of the FDIC. 
 For further information about the Corporations results segregated by its reportable segments, see Reportable Segment Results in the Managements Discussion and Analysis section of the Annual Report and Note 39, Segment Reporting included in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K.
Unless otherwise stated, all references in this Form 10-K to total loan portfolio, total credit exposure or loan portfolios, exclude covered loans, which represent loans acquired in the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction that were covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC and non-covered loans held-for-sale. The loss sharing agreements with the FDIC were terminated on May 22, 2018, as discussed in Note 10 included in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K.
Refer to the Overview section of Managements Discussion and Analysis, in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K., for information on recent significant events that have impacted or will impact our current and future operations. 
 Lending Activities 
 We concentrate our lending activities in the following areas: 
 

(1) | Commercial. Commercial loans are comprised of (i) commercial and industrial (C&I) loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations and to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other projects, and (ii) commercial real estate (CRE) loans (excluding construction loans) for income-producing real estate properties as well as owner-occupied properties. C&I loans are underwritten individually and usually secured with the assets of the company and the personal guarantee of the business owners. CRE loans consist of loans for income-producing real estate properties and the financing of owner-occupied facilities if there is real estate as collateral. Non-owner-occupied CRE loans are generally made to finance office and industrial buildings, healthcare facilities, multifamily buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinancing of the property.

(2) | Mortgage. Mortgage loans include residential mortgage loans to consumers for the purchase or refinancing of a residence and also include residential construction loans made to individuals for the construction or refurbishment of their residence.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Consumer. Consumer loans are mainly comprised of personal loans, credit cards, and automobile loans, and to a lesser extent home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and other loans made by banks to individual borrowers.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Construction. Construction loans are CRE loans to companies or developers used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property. Our construction loan portfolio primarily consists of retail, residential (land and condominiums), office and warehouse product types.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | Lease Financings. Lease financings are offered by BPPR and are primarily comprised of automobile loans/leases made through automotive dealerships and equipment lease financings.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | Legacy. At PB, we carry a legacy portfolio comprised of commercial loans, construction loans and lease financings related to certain lending products exited by the Corporation as part of restructuring efforts carried out in prior years at PB.

Covered Loans. 
 On April 30, 2010, BPPR acquired most of the loan portfolio of the former Westernbank Puerto Rico from the FDIC, as receiver (the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction). Loans acquired in the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction that were subject to a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC are referred to as covered loans. Covered foreclosed other real estate properties were also subject to loss sharing agreements. 
 The Corporation has presented the loans covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC separately as covered loans since the risk of loss was significantly different than those not covered under the loss-sharing agreements, due to the loss protection provided by the FDIC. On May 22, 2018, the Corporation entered into a Termination Agreement with the FDIC to terminate all loss-share arrangements in connection with the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction. As a result of the Termination Agreement, assets that were covered by the loss share agreement, including covered loans in the amount of approximately $514.6 million as of March 31, 2018, were reclassified as non-covered. The Corporation now recognizes entirely all future credit losses, expenses, gains, and recoveries related to the formerly covered assets with no offset due to or from the FDIC. 
Business Concentration 
 Since our business activities are currently concentrated primarily in Puerto Rico, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends of the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. The concentration of our operations in Puerto Rico exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base. Our asset and revenue composition by geographical area is presented in Financial Information about Geographic Areas below and in Note 39, Segment Reporting in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K.
Our loan portfolio is diversified by loan category. However, approximately 60% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 consisted of real estate-related loans, including residential mortgage loans, construction loans and commercial loans secured by commercial real estate. The table below presents the distribution of our loan portfolio by loan category at December 31, 2018. As described above, Legacy refers to loans remaining from lines of businesses we exited as a result of the restructuring of our U.S. operations in 2008 and 2009.

 Except for the Corporations exposure to the Puerto Rico Government sector, no individual or single group of related accounts is considered material in relation to our total assets or deposits, or in relation to our overall business. For a discussion of our loan portfolio and our exposure to the Government of Puerto Rico, see Financial Condition  Loans and Credit Risk  Geographical and Government Risk in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K.
Credit Administration and Credit Policies 
 Interest from our loan portfolios is our principal source of revenue. Whenever we make loans, we expose ourselves to credit risk. Credit risk is controlled and monitored through active asset quality management, including the use of lending standards, thorough review of potential borrowers and active asset quality administration. 
 Business activities that expose us to credit risk are managed within the Board of Directors Risk Management policy, and the Credit Risk Tolerance Limits policy, which establishes limits that consider factors such as maintaining a prudent balance of risk-taking across diversified risk types and business units, compliance with regulatory guidance, controlling the exposure to lower credit quality assets, and limiting growth in, and overall exposure to, any product or risk segment where we do not have sufficient experience and a proven ability to predict credit losses. 
 We maintain comprehensive credit policies for all lines of business in order to mitigate credit risk. Our credit policies are ratified by our Board of Directors and set forth, among other things, underwriting standards and procedures for monitoring and evaluating loan portfolio quality. Our credit policies also require prompt identification and quantification of asset quality deterioration or potential loss in order to ensure the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Included in these policies, primarily determined by the amount, type of loan and risk characteristics of the credit facility, are various approval levels and lending limit constraints, ranging from the branch or department level to those that are more centralized. 
 Our credit policies and procedures establish strict documentation requirements for each loan and related collateral type, when applicable, during the underwriting, closing and monitoring phases. During the initial loan underwriting process, the credit policies require, at a minimum, historical financial statements or tax returns of the borrower and any guarantor, an analysis of financial information contained in a credit approval package, a risk rating determination in the case of commercial and construction loans, reports from credit agencies and appraisals for real estate-related loans. The credit policies also set forth the required closing documentation depending on the loan and the collateral type. 
 Although we originate most of our loans internally in both the Puerto Rico and mainland United States markets, we occasionally purchase or participate in loans originated by other financial institutions. When we purchase or participate in loans originated by others, we conduct the same underwriting analysis of the borrowers and apply the same criteria as we do for loans originated by us. This also includes a review of the applicable legal documentation. 
 Refer to the Credit Risk section of Managements Discussion and Analysis, in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K for information related to management committees and divisions with responsibilities for establishing policies and monitoring the Corporations credit risk.

 Loan extensions, renewals and restructurings
Loans with satisfactory credit profiles can be extended, renewed or restructured. Many commercial loan facilities are structured as lines of credit, which are mainly one year in term and therefore are required to be renewed annually. Other facilities may be restructured or extended from time to time based upon changes in the borrowers business needs, use of funds, timing of completion of projects and other factors. If the borrower is not deemed to have financial difficulties, extensions, renewals and restructurings are done in the normal course of business and are not considered concessions, and the loans continue to be recorded as performing. 
 We evaluate various factors in order to determine if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties. Indicators that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties include, for example: (i) the borrower is currently in default on any of its debt or it is probable that the borrower would be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification; (ii) the borrower has declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy; (iii) there is significant doubt as to whether the borrower will continue to be a going concern; (iv) currently, the borrower has securities that have been delisted, are in the process of being delisted, or are under threat of being delisted from an exchange; and (v) based on estimates and projections that only encompass the current business capabilities, the borrower forecasts that its entity-specific cash flows will be insufficient to service the debt (both interest and principal) in accordance with the contractual terms of the existing agreement through maturity; and absent the current modification, the borrower cannot obtain funds from sources other than the existing creditors at an effective interest rate equal to the current market interest rate for similar debt for a non-troubled debtor. 
 We have specialized workout officers who handle substantially all commercial loans that are past due 90 days and over, borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, and those that are considered problem loans based on their risk profile. As a general policy, we do not advance additional money to borrowers that are 90 days past due or over. In commercial and construction loans, certain exceptions may be approved under certain circumstances, including (i) when past due status is administrative in nature, such as expiration of a loan facility before the new documentation is executed, and not as a result of payment or credit issues; (ii) to improve our collateral position or otherwise maximize recovery or mitigate potential future losses; and (iii) with respect to certain entities that, although related through common ownership, are not cross defaulted nor cross-collateralized and are performing satisfactorily under their respective loan facilities. Such advances are underwritten following our credit policy guidelines and approved up to prescribed policy limits, which are dependent on the borrowers financial condition, collateral and guarantee, among others. 
 In addition to the legal lending limit established under applicable state banking law, discussed in detail below, business activities that expose the Corporation to credit risk should be managed within guidelines described in the Credit Risk Tolerance Limits policy. Limits are defined for loss and credit performance metrics, portfolio composition and concentration, and industry and name-level, which monitors lending concentration to a single borrower or a group of related borrowers, including specific lending limits based on industry or other criteria, such as a percentage of the banks capital. 
 Refer to Notes 2 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K, for additional information on troubled debt restructuring (TDRs). 
 Competition 
 The financial services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. In Puerto Rico, our primary market, the banking business is highly competitive with respect to originating loans, acquiring deposits and providing other banking services. Most of our direct competition for our products and services comes from commercial banks. The principal competitors for BPPR include locally based commercial banks and a few large U.S. and foreign banks with operations in Puerto Rico. While the number of banking competitors in Puerto Rico has been reduced in recent years as a result of consolidations, these transactions have allowed some of our competitors to gain greater resources, such as a broader range of products and services. 
 We also compete with specialized players in the local financial industry that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Those competitors include brokerage firms, mortgage companies, insurance companies, automobile and equipment finance companies, local and federal credit unions (locally known as cooperativas), credit card companies, consumer finance companies, institutional lenders and other financial and non-financial institutions and entities. Credit unions generally provide basic consumer financial services. These competitors collectively represent a significant portion of the market and have lower cost structure and fewer regulatory constraints.

 In the United States we continue to face substantial competitive pressure as our footprint resides in two large, metropolitan markets of New York City / Northern New Jersey and the greater Miami area. There is a large number of Community and Regional banks along with national banking institutions present in both markets, many of which have a larger amount of resources than us. 
 In both Puerto Rico and the United States, the primary factors in competing for business include pricing, convenience of branch locations and other delivery methods, range of products offered, and the level of service delivered. We must compete effectively along all these parameters to be successful. We may experience pricing pressure as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. Competition is particularly acute in the market for deposits, where pricing is very aggressive. Increased competition could require that we increase the rates offered on deposits or lower the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect our profitability. 
 Economic factors, along with legislative and technological changes, will have an ongoing impact on the competitive environment within the financial services industry. We work to anticipate and adapt to dynamic competitive conditions whether it may be developing and marketing innovative products and services, adopting or developing new technologies that differentiate our products and services, cross-marketing, or providing personalized banking services. We strive to distinguish ourselves from other community banks and financial services providers in our marketplace by providing a high level of service to enhance customer loyalty and to attract and retain business. However, we can provide no assurance as to the effectiveness of these efforts on our future business or results of operations, and as to our continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changing conditions, and to sufficiently improve our services and/or banking products, in order to successfully compete in our primary service areas. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2018, we employed 8,474 full time equivalent employees, of which 7,764 were located in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and 710 in the U.S. mainland. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining group. 
Regulation and Supervision 
 Described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Popular, PNA and their respective subsidiaries. Such laws and regulations are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. Any change in the laws and regulations applicable to Popular and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of Popular and its subsidiaries. We will continue to assess our businesses and risk management and compliance practices to conform to developments in the regulatory environment. 
General 
 Popular and PNA are bank holding companies subject to consolidated supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act. BPPR and PB are subject to supervision and examination by applicable federal and state banking agencies including, in the case of BPPR, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico (the Office of the Commissioner), and, in the case of PB, the Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Department of Financial Services (the NYSDFS).

 The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in May 2018, and related statements and proposed rulemakings by the federal banking agencies revise certain aspects of the U.S. financial regulatory regime for banking organizations with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, such as Popular, BPPR, PNA and PB. For example, institutions with total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion but less than $100 billion are no longer required to conduct an annual company-run stress test of capital, consolidated earnings and losses, and institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more but less than $100 billion are no longer subject to enhanced prudential standards, including risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity standards, risk management and risk committee requirements, stress test requirements and a debt-to-equity limit for companies that the Financial Stability Oversight Council has determined would pose a grave threat to financial stability were they to fail such limits. In addition, publicly traded U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more but less than $50 billion are no longer required to establish enterprise-wide risk committees. As of December 31, 2018, Popular had total consolidated assets of $47.6 billion. 
 Transactions with Affiliates 
 BPPR and PB are subject to restrictions that limit the amount of extensions of credit and certain other covered transactions (as defined in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act) between BPPR or PB, on the one hand, and Popular, PNA or any of our other non-banking subsidiaries, on the other, and that impose collateralization requirements on such credit extensions. A bank may not engage in any covered transaction if the aggregate amount of the banks covered transactions with that affiliate would exceed 10% of the banks capital stock and surplus or the aggregate amount of the banks covered transactions with all affiliates would exceed 20% of the banks capital stock and surplus. In addition, any transaction between BPPR or PB, on the one hand, and Popular, PNA or any of our other non-banking subsidiaries, on the other, is required to be carried out on an arms length basis. 
 Source of Financial Strength 
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires bank holding companies, such as Popular and PNA, to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. Popular and PNA are expected to commit resources to support their subsidiary banks, including at times when Popular and PNA may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary depository institutions are subordinated in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary depository institution. In the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. BPPR and PB are currently the only insured depository institution subsidiaries of Popular and PNA. 
Resolution Planning 
 Bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $100 billion or more are required to report periodically to the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board such companys plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. In addition, insured depository institutions with total assets of $50 billion or more are required to submit to the FDIC periodic contingency plans for resolution in the event of the institutions failure. 
 As of December 31, 2018, Popular, PNA, BPPR and PBs total assets were below the thresholds for applicability of these rules. 
 Dividend Restrictions 
 The principal sources of funding for Popular and PNA have included dividends received from their banking and non-banking subsidiaries, asset sales and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity. Various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval. A member bank must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year, combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board. Pursuant to these requirements, PB may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board or the NYSDFS. During the year ended December 31, 2018, BPPR declared cash dividends of $446 million, a portion of which was used by Popular for the payments of the cash dividends on its outstanding common stock, $125 million accelerated stock repurchase, to partially fund the redemption of $450 million, 7% senior notes and the redemption of $53 million in trust preferred securities. Subject to the Federal Reserves ability to establish more stringent specific requirements under its supervisory or enforcement authority, at December 31, 2018, BPPR could have declared a dividend of approximately $218 million. It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organizations current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Moreover, under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company should not maintain dividend levels that place undue pressure on the capital of depository institution subsidiaries or that may undermine the bank holding companys ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. For further information please refer to Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

 Subject to compliance with certain conditions, distributions of U.S. sourced dividends to a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are subject to a withholding tax of 10% instead of the 30% applied to other foreign corporations. 
 See Puerto Rico Regulation below for a description of certain restrictions on BPPRs ability to pay dividends under Puerto Rico law. 
 FDIC Insurance 
 Substantially all the deposits of BPPR and PB are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC, and BPPR and PB are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. Deposit insurance assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution minus the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period. For smaller depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as PB, FDIC assigns an individual rate based on a formula using financial data and CAMELS ratings. For larger depository institutions with over $10 billion in assets, such as BPPR, the FDIC uses a scorecard methodology, which also considers CAMELS ratings, among other measures, that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual large institution will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the deposit insurance fund if such a failure occurs. The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations. Beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate for depositary institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, including BPPR, ranges from 3 to 30 basis points on an annualized basis. After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from 1.5 to 40 basis points on an annualized basis. As of July 1, 2016, the FDIC imposes a surcharge on the assessments of depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, including BPPR. The surcharge would last through the quarter the reserve ratio reaches or exceeds 1.35% but no later than December 31, 2018 when a shortfall assessment will be applied to March 2019 invoice. On September 30, 2018, the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached 1.36 percent. Upon reaching the minimum DIF, small banks, such as PB will receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15 percent and 1.35 percent, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38 percent. 
 The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 separated the Financing Corporation (FICO) assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the DIF assessment. The amount assessed on individual institutions by the FICO is in addition to the amount paid for deposit insurance according to the FDICs risk-related assessment rate schedules. The FICO assessment rate for the first quarter of 2019 was 0.140 basis points of the assessment base. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a DIF average total asset less average tangible equity assessment base of approximately $43 billion. 
 Brokered Deposits 
 The FDIA and regulations adopted thereunder restrict the use of brokered deposits and the rate of interest payable on deposits for institutions that are less than well capitalized. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized. Popular does not believe the brokered deposits regulations have had or will have a material effect on the funding or liquidity of BPPR and PB. 
Capital Adequacy 
 Popular, BPPR and PB are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve Board. In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved final rules (the Basel III Capital Rules) implementing the December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
 Among other matters, the Basel III Capital Rules: (i) introduce a new capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and the related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to prior regulations. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, including Popular, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the Basel III Capital Rules specific requirements. 
 Pursuant to the Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are: 
 

 | 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;
--+-----------------------------------


 | 6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 4% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the leverage ratio).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11 


 The Basel III Capital Rules also introduce a new capital conservation buffer, composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. Thus, Popular, BPPR and PB are required to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increased by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. 
 In addition, under prior risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI) items included in shareholders equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities held in the available for sale portfolio) under U.S. GAAP were reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Pursuant to the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including Popular, BPPR and PB, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. Popular, BPPR and PB have made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their securities portfolios. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, from inclusion in bank holding companies Tier 1 capital. Trust preferred securities no longer included in Populars Tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a component of Tier 2 capital. Popular has not issued any trust preferred securities since May 19, 2010. At December 31, 2018, Popular has $374 million of trust preferred securities outstanding which no longer qualify for Tier 1 capital treatment, but instead qualify for Tier 2 capital treatment. 
 Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject Popular and its depository institution subsidiaries to a variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and to certain restrictions on our business. See  Prompt Corrective Action. 
 In November 2017, the federal bank regulators adopted a final rule to extend the transitional regulatory capital treatment applicable during 2017 for certain items, including certain deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing assets, investments in non-consolidated financial entities and minority interests, for non-advanced approaches banking organizations, such as Popular, BPPR and PB. Had the transitional provisions been fully phased-in on December 31, 2018, the Corporation would have continued to exceed well capitalized requirements. 
 In December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as Basel IV). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committees standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments, such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. These standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to Popular, BPPR and PB. The impact of Basel IV on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators. 
 In December 2018, the federal banking agencies approved a final rule modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase in over a period of three years the day-one regulatory capital effects of the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model of ASU 2016-13. The final rule also revises the agencies other rules to reflect the update to the accounting standards. 
 Refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K., Note 22 Regulatory Capital Requirements and Table 9 of Managements Discussion and Analysis for the capital ratios of Popular, BPPR and PB under Basel III.

 Prompt Corrective Action 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDIA) requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. A depository institutions capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors. 
 An insured depository institution will be deemed to be (i) well capitalized if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) adequately capitalized if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not well capitalized; (iii) undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv) significantly undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) critically undercapitalized if the institutions tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. An insured depository institutions capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the institutions overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 
 The FDIC generally prohibits an insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institutions holding company must guarantee the capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institutions assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency, when the institution fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. 
 Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator. 
 The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA apply to the FDIC-insured depository institutions such as BPPR and PB, but they are not directly applicable to holding companies such as Popular and PNA, which control such institutions. As of December 31, 2018, both BPPR and PB were well capitalized. 
 Interstate Branching 
 The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the Interstate Banking Act) to authorize national banks and state banks to branch interstate through de novo branches. For purposes of the Interstate Banking Act, BPPR is treated as a state bank and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as are other state banks. 
Activities and Acquisitions 
 In general, the BHC Act limits the activities permissible for bank holding companies to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and such other activities as the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be properly incidental thereto. Bank holding companies whose subsidiary depository institutions meet management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards may elect to be treated as a financial holding company and engage in a substantially broader range of nonbanking financial activities, including securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in nonfinancial companies. 
 
13 


 In order for a bank holding company to elect to be treated as a financial holding company, (i) all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized (as described above) and well managed and (ii) it must file a declaration with the Federal Reserve Board that it elects to be a financial holding company. A bank holding company electing to be a financial holding company must also be and remain well capitalized and well managed. Popular and PNA have elected to be treated as financial holding companies. A depository institution is deemed to be well managed if, at its most recent inspection, examination or subsequent review by the appropriate federal banking agency (or the appropriate state banking agency), the depository institution received at least a satisfactory composite rating and at least a satisfactory rating for the management component of the composite rating. If, after becoming a financial holding company, the company fails to continue to meet any of the capital or management requirements for financial holding company status, the company must enter into a confidential agreement with the Federal Reserve Board to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve Board may extend the agreement or may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may discontinue, or divest investments in companies engaged in, activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company. 
 The Federal Reserve Board may in certain circumstances limit our ability to conduct activities and make acquisitions that would otherwise be permissible for a financial holding company. In addition, we are required to obtain prior Federal Reserve Board approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both in the United States and abroad. 
 Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets greater than $250 billion (regardless of whether such bank holding companies have elected to be treated as financial holding companies) must provide prior written notice to the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring shares of certain financial companies with assets in excess of $10 billion, unless an exception applies. In addition, a financial holding company (regardless of its size) must obtain prior written approval from the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring a nonbank company with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. As of December 31, 2018, Popular had total consolidated assets of $47.6 billion. 
 The so-called Volcker Rule issued under the Dodd-Frank Act restricts the ability of Popular and its subsidiaries, including BPPR and PB, to sponsor or invest in private funds or to engage in certain types of proprietary trading. Popular and its subsidiaries generally do not engage in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule; therefore, the Volcker Rule does not have a material effect on our operations. Development and monitoring of the required compliance program, however, may require the expenditure of significant resources and management attention. In July 2018, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, FDIC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and SEC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to amend the application of the Volcker Rule based on the size and scope of a banking entitys trading activities and to clarify and amend certain definitions, requirements and exemptions. The ultimate impact of any amendments to the Volcker Rule will depend on, among other things, further rulemaking and implementation guidance from the relevant federal regulatory agencies and the development of market practices and standards. 
 Anti-Money Laundering Initiative and the USA PATRIOT Act 
 A major focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the USA PATRIOT Act) strengthened the ability of the U.S. government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act imposed significant compliance and due diligence obligations, created new crimes and penalties and expanded the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Acts requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 
 Community Reinvestment Act 
 The Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities, including extending credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and geographies. Should Popular or our bank subsidiaries fail to serve adequately the community, potential penalties may include regulatory denials of applications to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, expand into new financial activities and merge with or purchase other financial institutions. 
Interchange Fees Regulation 
 The Federal Reserve Board has established standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibited network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. The maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board allows for an upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuers debit card interchange fee if the issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention standards. 
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 
 The Dodd-Frank Act created a new consumer financial services regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB), which assumed most of the consumer financial services regulatory responsibilities previously exercised by federal banking regulators and other agencies. The CFPBs primary functions include the supervision of covered persons (broadly defined to include 
 
14 


  any person offering or providing a consumer financial product or service and any affiliated service provider) for compliance with federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB also has the broad power to prescribe rules applicable to a covered person or service provider identifying as unlawful, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. We are subject to examination and regulation by the CFPB. 
 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 
 The U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government of the sanctioned country or other specially designated nationals have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the United States or the possession or control of U.S. persons outside of the United States). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 
Protection of Customer Personal Information and Cybersecurity 
 The privacy provisions of Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 generally prohibit financial institutions, including us, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes and governs the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies. 
 The federal banking regulators have also issued guidance and proposed rules regarding cybersecurity that are intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions. A financial institution is expected to establish lines of defense and to ensure that its risk management processes address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials. A financial institutions management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institutions operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 
 Puerto Rico and state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. For instance, Puerto Rico law requires business to implement information security controls to protect consumers personal information from breaches, as well as to provide notice of any breach to affected customers. Several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act was enacted in June 2018 and will impose privacy compliance obligations with regard to the personal information of California residents. We expect this trend to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in Puerto Rico and the states in which we operate. 
 Incentive Compensation 
 The Federal Reserve Board reviews, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Popular, that are not large, complex banking organizations. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings, which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 
 The Federal Reserve Board, OCC and FDIC have issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors.

 The Federal Reserve Board, other federal banking agencies and the SEC have jointly published proposed rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including Popular, PNA, BPPR and PB). The proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered entities, and additional requirements for entities with total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion. These additional requirements would not be applicable to Popular, PNA, BPPR and PB, each of which currently has less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets. Although the proposed revised rules include more stringent requirements, it cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted. 
 Puerto Rico Regulation 
 As a commercial bank organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, BPPR is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, pursuant to the Puerto Rico Banking Act of 1933, as amended (the Banking Law). 
 Section 27 of the Banking Law requires that at least ten percent (10%) of the yearly net income of BPPR be credited annually to a reserve fund. The apportionment must be done every year until the reserve fund is equal to the total of paid-in capital on common and preferred stock. During 2018, $ 58.3 million was transferred to the statutory reserve account. During 2018, BPPR was in compliance with the statutory reserve requirement. 
 Section 27 of the Banking Law also provides that when the expenditures of a bank are greater than its receipts, the excess of the former over the latter must be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the reserve fund. If the reserve fund is not sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the outstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and no dividend may be declared until capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original capital. 
 Section 16 of the Banking Law requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve that, except as otherwise provided by the Office of the Commissioner, may not be less than 20% of its demand liabilities, excluding government deposits (federal, state and municipal) which are secured by collateral. If a bank is authorized to establish one or more bank branches in a state of the United States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the reserve requirements of Section 16. Pursuant to an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated November 24, 1982, BPPR has been exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal Reserve System with respect to deposits payable in Puerto Rico. Accordingly, BPPR is subject to the reserve requirements prescribed by the Banking Law. 
 Section 17 of the Banking Law permits a bank to make loans to any one person, firm, partnership or corporation, up to an aggregate amount of fifteen percent (15%) of the paid-in capital and reserve fund of the bank. As of December 31, 2018, the legal lending limit for BPPR under this provision was approximately $286 million. In the case of loans which are secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the maximum aggregate amount is increased to one third of the paid-in capital of the bank, plus its reserve fund. If the institution is well capitalized and had been rated 1 in the last examination performed by the Office of the Commissioner or any regulatory agency, its legal lending limit shall also include 15% of 50% of its undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the capital of the bank shall also include 33 1/3% of 50% of its undivided profits. Institutions rated 2 in their last regulatory examination may include this additional component in their legal lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of the Commissioner. There are no restrictions under Section 17 on the amount of loans that are wholly secured by bonds, securities and other evidence of indebtedness of the Government of the United States or Puerto Rico, or by current debt bonds, not in default, of municipalities or instrumentalities of Puerto Rico. 
 Section 14 of the Banking Law authorizes a bank to conduct certain financial and related activities directly or through subsidiaries, including finance leasing of personal property and originating and servicing mortgage loans. BPPR engages in finance leasing through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Popular Auto, LLC, which is organized and operates in Puerto Rico. The origination and servicing of mortgage loans is conducted by Popular Mortgage, a division of BPPR.
