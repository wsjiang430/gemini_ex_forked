Item 1 – Business
Overview
    OneSpan helps organizations accelerate digital transformations by enabling secure, compliant, and refreshingly easy digital customer agreements and transaction experiences. We deliver digital agreement products and services that automate and secure customer-facing and revenue-generating business processes. Our solutions help organizations streamline and secure user experiences, which in turn allows them to drive growth, reduce risk, and unlock their business potential. 
We are a global leader in providing high-assurance identity and authentication security as well as enterprise-grade electronic signature (e-signature) solutions, for use cases ranging from simple transactions to workflows that are complex or require higher levels of security. Our solutions help our clients ensure the integrity of the people and records associated with digital agreements, transactions, and interactions in industries including banking, financial services, healthcare, and professional services. We are trusted by global blue-chip enterprises, including more than 60% of the world’s largest 100 banks, and process millions of digital agreements and billions of transactions in more than 100 countries annually. 
Our solutions are powered by a portfolio of products and services across identity verification, authentication, virtual interactions and transactions, and secure digital storage. These products and services can be acquired and embedded individually within enterprise business workflows or assembled into tailored solutions for simple yet secure business-to-business, business-to-employee, and business-to-customer experiences.
We offer our solutions through cloud-based and, in select cases, on-premises solutions using both open standards and proprietary technologies. We offer our products primarily through a subscription licensing model. Our solutions are sold worldwide through our direct sales force, as well as through distributors, resellers, systems integrators, and original equipment manufacturers.
Business Transformation
    We are currently in the midst of a business transformation. Our total revenue decreased on a year-over-year basis in 2020 and 2021, and we experienced negative operating income and net losses in both of those years. During 2021 and early 2022, our previous CEO, CFO, and several other senior executives left the company. In late November 2021, our current CEO joined us and has built a new executive team over the course of 2022 to effect the transformation.
    In May 2022, we announced a three-year strategic transformation plan that began on January 1, 2023. We believe this transformation plan will enable us to build on our strong solution portfolio and market position, enhance our enterprise go-to-market strategy, accelerate revenue growth, and drive efficiencies to support margin expansion and increased profitability. In conjunction with the strategic transformation plan and to enable a more efficient capital deployment model, effective with the quarter ended June 30, 2022, we began reporting under the following two lines of business, which are our reportable operating segments: Digital Agreements and Security Solutions.
•Digital Agreements. Digital Agreements consists of solutions that enable our clients to secure and automate business processes associated with their digital agreement and customer transaction lifecycles that require consent, non-repudiation and compliance. These solutions, which are largely cloud-based, include our OneSpan Sign e-signature solution and our recently introduced OneSpan Notary and Virtual Room solutions.. As our transformation plan progresses, we expect to include other cloud-based security modules associated with the secure transaction lifecycle of identity verification, authentication, virtual interaction and transactions, and secure digital storage in the Digital Agreements segment. This segment also includes costs attributable to our transaction-cloud platform. 
•Security Solutions. Security Solutions consist of our broad portfolio of software products and/or software development kits (SDKs) that are used to build applications designed to defend against attacks on digital transactions across online environments, devices and applications. These solutions, which are largely on-premises software products, include identity verification, multi-factor authentication and transaction signing, such as mobile application security, mobile software tokens, and Digipass authenticators that are not cloud connected devices. 
    We expect to manage Digital Agreements for accelerated growth and market share gains and Security Solutions for cash flows given its more modest growth profile. Across both segments, we plan to build on our strong foundation in both e-signature and cybersecurity by enhancing product features, developing new solutions, and building out our next-generation transaction cloud platform, which we expect will allow us to efficiently deliver security and e-signature solutions to our customers across their entire digital agreement lifecycle. We also plan to enhance our go-to-market strategy by prioritizing growth at large enterprise accounts, expanding our direct sales force, and accessing new routes to market through alliances and partnerships.  
Our transformation plan involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Please see Item IA, Risk Factors.
Industry Background 
While digital transformation and the shift to cloud-delivered experiences across all industries has helped increase the pace of innovation and business execution, it has also increased security risks for organizations, their customers, and their employees. People and records associated with business interactions, transactions, and agreements have become the biggest attack surface, or point of vulnerability, to cyber-attacks.
Today’s cybersecurity bad actors are more sophisticated and well-resourced, which means that enterprises everywhere are confronted with security threats on all fronts, from identity fraud and firewall breaches to nation-state espionage. Without secure and enforceable business processes and outcomes, economies everywhere are vulnerable. However, current security measures are typically at odds with the pressure for organizations to drive growth and support increasing customer expectations for frictionless user experiences.
For high-value transactions and agreements that have shifted to digital workflows, these challenges are amplified due to the fragmented legal requirements, regulatory rules, and complexity associated with doing business across state and national borders. In addition to automating and securing these digital workflows, cross-border identity verification, data privacy, and sovereignty regulations vary from one jurisdiction to the next, complicating compliance for organizations operating globally.
We believe that these trends will continue to accelerate and evolve, creating a unique opportunity for OneSpan to leverage its global security roots to deliver technology that enables frictionless customer experiences, with security seamlessly interwoven throughout every action and interaction. OneSpan is uniquely positioned to help organizations deliver the simple and intuitive experiences their customers demand today, while preparing them for the security challenges of tomorrow. 
Our Products and Services Portfolio 
    We offer a portfolio of products and solutions to enable secure, compliant and refreshingly easy customer interactions and transactions. Whereas other companies provide point solutions for either security or digital agreements, we support the entire lifecycle of digital agreements for global enterprises that need to meet the highest levels of assurance, security, and compliance, all while using a human-centric approach that minimizes friction for customers. Our portfolio spans across the stages of the digital agreement process:
•Verify – Identity Proofing and Verification: Establish a relationship with your customer, starting with knowing who they are. 
•Authenticate – User Authentication: Protect yourself and your customer’s identity with strong customer authentication. 
•Interact – Virtual Room: Connect and collaborate with your customers in a secure, virtual environment. 
•Transact – E-Sign: Sign transactions and agreements remotely and securely. 
•Store – Secure Vaulting: Complete the digital agreement process by securely storing transaction records and documentation. 
Since June 30, 2022, we have reported our financial results under two operating segments: Digital Agreements and Security Solutions. The products and services that currently fall under each segment are shown below; however, as our transformation plan progresses and we deliver more of our products and services through our next-generation transaction- cloud platform, we expect to include other cloud-based security modules across the digital agreements lifecycle in the Digital Agreements segment.
Digital Agreements
OneSpan Sign supports a broad range of e-signature requirements from simple to complex, and from the occasional agreement to processing tens of thousands of transactions. OneSpan Sign provides multiple deployment options, including public cloud or private cloud, without compromising security or functionality. The solution is also available in a Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) SaaS-level compliant cloud, allowing U.S. government agencies to implement e- signatures in the cloud and meet General Services Administration (GSA) security requirements.
Customers can configure OneSpan Sign to reinforce their brand for a seamless signing experience. Each step of the digital agreement workflow can be customized, from authentication to e-signing and secure storage. OneSpan Sign also provides comprehensive and secure electronic evidence for strong legal protection by capturing all actions that took place during the agreement process. This reduces the time and cost of gathering evidence and demonstrating legal and regulatory compliance. Electronic signature capabilities can be a critical component of the account opening and onboarding processes, providing a secure and user-friendly way to execute legally binding agreements.
Virtual Room is a purpose-built, high-assurance solution that blends the simplicity of a consumer video collaboration app with high-assurance identity and authentication security. OneSpan’s secure Virtual Room cloud service enables organizations to deliver live, high-touch assistance to their customers in a secure virtual environment. This next-generation customer engagement solution gives organizations the ability to combine identity verification, authentication, and e-signature solutions from the broader OneSpan portfolio with a high-assurance virtual experience that removes the friction of entering a branch or meeting in person. In addition, robust audit and compliance controls help manage risk and meet regulatory requirements. 
 OneSpan Notary is the newest addition to the OneSpan product portfolio that spans the entire digital agreements lifecycle from identifying an unknown signer all the way to securely storing an agreement and associated assets. Developed for organizations with in-house notaries, OneSpan Notary includes live electronic signature, two-way secured videoconferencing, and strong identity proofing options, like ID Verification and Knowledge-based Authentication (KBA). It also simplifies the notarization process with guided workflows, the ability to upload eNotary Seal, recording, eJournaling, and audit trail capabilities in a single solution. 
Digipass CX is OneSpan’s latest family of cloud-connected high-assurance identity verification and authentication devices designed to increase security, minimize fraud, and simplify the user experience. These new devices rely on biometrics rather than one-time passwords which can be stolen via social engineering. Because these devices are connected to the cloud, they can be dynamically provisioned, reprovisioned, and even updated to incorporate new features and applications as they become available in the future. We plan for the first two Digipass CX models to be generally available later in 2023. 
Secure Storage is a new addition to the OneSpan product portfolio through the first quarter 2023 acquisition of ProvenDB. OneSpan plans to integrate the ProvenDB Compliance Vault technology obtained through the acquisition to add blockchain-backed secure storage initially for the OneSpan Sign product and eventually across the entire portfolio. This new secure storage capability is designed for high-value, high-risk use-cases by providing tamper resistant document storage supported by immutable compliance data, all protected by blockchain technology. 
Security Solutions
OneSpan Identity Verification gives banks and other financial institutions access to a wide range of identity verification services – all through a single API integration. This includes identity document (e.g., driver’s license, passport, etc.) capture and real-time authenticity verification, as well as facial comparison (“selfie”) and liveness detection (the ability to detect whether a digital interaction is with a live human being) to establish that the individual presenting the identity document is the same person whose picture appears on the authenticated identity document.
OneSpan Cloud Authentication is a quick-to-deploy, cloud-based multifactor authentication solution that supports a full range of authentication options including biometrics, push notification, visual cryptograms for transaction data security, SMS, and hardware authenticators. This allows customers to solve strong authentication problems across different endpoints to best meet their unique requirements through a single provider rather than integrating multiple modalities together. It eliminates cost associated with managing legacy on-premises authentication technology and 
provides a seamless upgrade path to more comprehensive capabilities such as Intelligent Adaptive Authentication, which applies a precise level of security for each unique customer interaction using advanced real-time risk analysis and scoring.
Mobile Security Suite is a comprehensive software development kit that helps protect mobile transactions from bad actors by allowing organizations to natively integrate security features including geolocation, device identification, jailbreak and root detection, fingerprint and face recognition, one-time password delivery via push notification, and transaction data security, among others. Through a comprehensive library of APIs, application developers can extend and strengthen application security, deliver enhanced convenience to their application users, and streamline application deployment and lifecycle management processes. Mobile Security Suite also includes a Runtime Application Self-Protection module, which can detect and mitigate malicious app activity and potential loss to hacking activities.
Authentication Server resides on-premises and incorporates a range of strong authentication utilities and solutions designed to allow organizations to securely authenticate users and transactions. The solution, once integrated, becomes largely transparent to users, minimizing rollout and support issues. Authentication Server encompasses multiple authentication technologies (e.g., passwords, dynamic password technologies, certificates, and biometrics) and allows the use of any combination of those technologies simultaneously.
Digipass Authenticators are our family of hardware authenticators, consisting of a wide variety of authentication devices, each of which has its own distinct characteristics to meet the needs of our customers. All models of the Digipass family of authenticators are designed to work together so customers can switch devices without changes to their existing infrastructure. Our models range from one-button devices and smart card readers to devices that include more advanced technologies, such as public key infrastructure (PKI) and visual cryptography. Digipass devices included in the Security Solutions segment are not cloud-connected, in contrast to our cloud-connected Digipass CX device, which we expect to include in the Digital Agreements segment. 
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights and Licenses 
    We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, design, and trade secret laws, as well as employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property, or IP, and other proprietary rights. In particular, we hold several patents in the U.S. and in other countries, which cover multiple aspects of our technology. These patents expire between 2023 and 2040. In addition to the issued patents, we also have several patent applications pending in the U.S., Europe, and other countries. Many of our issued and pending patents are related to our Digipass product line. In addition to our owned IP, we license software from third parties for integration into our solutions, including open-source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.    We furthermore have registrations for most of our trademarks in most of the markets where we sell the corresponding products and services, as well as registrations of the designs of many of our hardware products, primarily in the European Union (EU) and China. 
Protecting IP rights can be difficult, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. We may not be able to secure IP rights covering our own products or may have difficulties obtaining IP licenses from other companies on commercially favorable terms. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see Item IA, Risk Factors.
Research and Development 
    Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on enhancing our solutions by building new features, functionality, and applications; developing technology to support new products; enhancing our next-generation transaction- cloud platform; and conducting product and quality assurance testing. We employ a team of full-time engineers and, from time to time, also engage independent engineering firms to conduct certain product development efforts on our behalf. For fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we incurred expenses, net of software capitalization, of $41.7 million, $47.4 million, and $41.2 million, respectively, for research and development. 
Production
Our Digipass authentication devices are manufactured by third-party manufacturers pursuant to purchase orders that we issue. The majority of our Digipass products are manufactured by four independent factories in Southern China and one in Romania. We maintain local teams in China and Romania to conduct quality control and quality assurance 
procedures. Periodic visits are conducted by our personnel for quality management, assembly process review, and supplier relations. 
Digipass devices are made primarily from commercially available electronic components, including microprocessors purchased from several suppliers. We purchase microprocessors and arrange for shipment to third parties for assembly and testing in accordance with our design specifications. The microprocessors are the most important components of the devices which are not commodity items readily available on the open market. 
During 2022, the supply chain for our Digipass devices was impacted by global issues related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the inflationary cost environment, particularly with respect to materials in the semiconductor market, including part shortages, increased freight costs, diminished transportation capacity and labor constraints. This has resulted in disruptions in our supply chain, as well as difficulties and delays in procuring certain microprocessors. Since late 2021, our costs have increased due to elevated lead times and increased material costs, in particular the need to purchase microprocessors from alternative sources. We expect increased costs to procure materials within the semiconductor market to continue in 2023. Further, we anticipate that the broader impact of inflationary pressures, increased material costs, and supply chain disruptions may continue in 2023.
In response to these supply chain conditions, in 2022 we focused on improving our supplier network, engineering alternative designs, and working to reduce supply shortages. We are actively managing our inventory in an effort to minimize supply chain disruptions and enable continuity of supply and services to our customers, and we may maintain elevated levels of inventory for certain of our products until supply constraints have been remediated. We are also considering alternative manufacturing and supply arrangements, including moving more of our manufacturing from China to Romania or other locations, to mitigate supply chain risks in the future.
Our software solutions are produced in-house or developed by third parties and sold under license.
Competition
    The market for digital solutions for identity, authentication, and secure digital agreements is very competitive and, like most technology-driven markets, is subject to rapid change and constantly evolving solutions and services. Our identity verification and authentication products are designed to allow authorized users access to digital business processes and properties, in some cases using patented technology, as a replacement for or supplement to a static password. Our main competitors in our identity verification and authentication markets are Gemalto, a subsidiary of Thales Group, and RSA Security. There are also many other companies, such as Transmit Security, Symantec, and Duo Security, that offer competing services. 
In addition to these companies, we face competition from many small authentication solution providers, many of whom offer new technologies and niche solutions such as biometric or risk and behavioral analysis. We believe that competition in this market is likely to intensify as a result of increasing demand for security products. 
Our primary competitors for electronic signature solutions are DocuSign and Adobe Systems. Both companies are significantly larger than us. In addition to these companies, there are numerous smaller and regional or niche providers of electronic signing solutions.
We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for digital solutions for identity, security, and electronic signatures include the strength and effectiveness of the solution, technical features, ease of use, quality and reliability, customer service and support, brand recognition, customer base, distribution channels, and the total cost of ownership of the solution. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to most of these factors, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. Some of our present and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, purchasing, and other resources. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, or to deliver competitive products at a lower end-user price. Please see Item IA, Risk Factors.
Sales and Marketing
    Our solutions are sold worldwide through our direct sales force as well as through distributors, resellers, systems integrators, and original equipment manufacturers. Our sales staff coordinates sales activity through both our sales channels 
and those of our partners, making direct sales calls either alone or with the sales personnel of our partners. Our sales staff also provides product education seminars to sales and technical personnel of resellers and distributors, with whom we have working relationships, and to potential end users of our products.
As part of our three-year strategic plan, we are enhancing our go-to-market strategy in several ways, including: shifting to a unified sales force that sells across our full solution portfolio (rather than separate sales forces for e-signature and security solutions); prioritizing growth at large enterprise accounts; expanding our direct sales force; and accessing new routes to market through alliances and partnerships. Our expanded selling effort also includes identifying additional applications for our solutions, cross-selling our products to existing enterprise customers, and selling our full portfolio into new market segments and additional geographic markets.
Customers and Markets
The majority of our revenue is derived from financial institutions, which include traditional banks, credit unions, and online-only banks. We also sell to the enterprise market segment, government, healthcare, and insurance industries in select regions around the globe. We believe there are substantial opportunities for future growth, both within the market segments we currently serve and in new market segments, as we expand our product portfolio and go-to-market strategy.
Our top 10 customers contributed 23%, 22%, and 21% in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, of our total worldwide revenue. 
Because a significant portion of our sales is denominated in foreign currencies, changes in exchange rates impact results of operations. To mitigate exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we attempt to denominate an amount of billings in a currency such that it would provide a hedge against operating expenses being incurred in that currency. For additional information regarding how currency fluctuations can affect our business, please refer to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
We also experience seasonality or variation across the year in our markets. These trends can include lower sales during the summer months, particularly in Europe.
Financial Information Relating to Foreign and Domestic Operations
For financial information regarding OneSpan, see our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, which are included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 17, Geographic, Customer and Supplier Information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a breakdown of revenue, gross profit and long-lived assets between the U.S. and other regions.
Government Regulation 
    As a global cybersecurity company, we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used. Also, because banking and financial services is our largest industry target market, the government regulations affecting our customers in this area have a significant indirect effect on our business. Similar regulatory dynamics occur in the other primary markets where we have customers, such as healthcare and government. Additional proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business.
See Item IA, Risk Factors, for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with those laws and regulations.
Human Capital
OneSpan is powered by a team of approximately 790 employees that spans the globe, consisting of approximately 300 employees in Canada, 292 in Europe, 27 in the Middle East and Latin America, 134 in the United States, and 37 in the Asia Pacific Region. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 309 of our employees were in research and development, 338 in sales and marketing, and 143 in general and administrative. 
We are currently in the early stages of a business transformation that we believe will disrupt our industry by securing the digital agreements process while taking a human-centric approach to end-user experience. We understand that 
achieving this ambitious goal will depend primarily on the skills, creativity, and determination of our people, and we believe that people do their best work in an environment built on a compelling shared purpose, openness, trust, mutual accountability, and the opportunity to make a meaningful impact. To that end, our human capital objectives are built on the following five pillars, which we refer to as our “People Promise”:
•Now is the time. With a bold vision and an ambitious market opportunity, we are ready to seize the moment. There’s never been a better time to join the team and play a part in the OneSpan story.
•Start from openness. We lead with transparency, engage with open minds, and promote diversity in our thinking and in our culture. That’s why we encourage each of our people to bring their whole self to work and be open to different ideas, new challenges, and new possibilities.
•Build it on trust. Real connections and true collaboration are built on trust. We trust each other and have no time for internal politics. We trust our people to always to bring their best. We trust ourselves to take chances and to build something bigger – together.
•Own it. We believe in empowerment through freedom: giving our people flexibility and enabling them to carve their path, their way. We don’t just ask our team to embrace change; we ask them to own it. 
•Make a global impact. We challenge the now by thinking ahead, speaking up, and working together to constantly improve. Everyone is an integral part of the work we do with an equal opportunity to participate and make a global impact.
 The goal of our People Promise is to create an environment that will attract, retain and develop talented people who are motivated to find opportunities and create new possibilities for our customers, for themselves and their teams, and for OneSpan. To achieve this goal, we focus on the areas described below. 
Competitive Compensation and Benefits. We seek to provide our employees with competitive and fair compensation and benefit offerings, and use market benchmarks to ensure external competitiveness while maintaining equity within the organization. We tie incentive compensation to both business and individual performance and provide a range of health, wellness, family leave, savings, retirement, and time-off benefits for our employees, which vary based on local regulations and norms.
 Engagement. We regularly request input from employees, including through a broad employee engagement survey conducted annually and through more frequent, “pulse” surveys. These surveys are intended to measure our progress in promoting an environment where employees are engaged, productive, and have a strong sense of belonging. As part of our commitment to acting on employee input, we also use survey results to identify areas where we can do better and expect our managers to actively work to improve those areas. 
Hybrid Workplace Policy. For our employees who live near one of our offices, we have adopted a hybrid work model whereby employees generally come to the office in person once a week, on a day designated by local office leadership. For the rest of the week, employees may work either remotely or from their local office. We believe this approach maintains the flexibility of remote work while also providing a regular opportunity for in-person interactions to collaborate, innovate, and build relationships with colleagues. 
Diversity and Inclusion. With approximately 790 employees around the world and customers in more than 100 countries, we understand the importance of diversity in perspectives, experience, backgrounds and cultures. As part of our efforts to encourage diversity and inclusion, all employees take an annual diversity and inclusion training and an unconscious bias training. We also work with diversity focused job sites and candidate application platforms to increase access to diverse talent. In addition, we have an active employee resource group, Women at OneSpan, focused on providing support, mentoring and other resources for our female employees, and are beginning the process of making other employee resource groups available to interested employees. 
We monitor the gender diversity of our workforce regularly. We measure gender diversity overall, by job level, and by job category. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 31% of our employees identified as female, up from 27% at the end of 2021. The percentage of women in all job levels and categories also improved year over year. Although our gender diversity metrics may fluctuate from period to period, over the longer term, we hope and expect to see continued improvement in the representation of women across the company. 
We are also proud of the strides we have made during 2022 in the diversity of our executive leadership team. As a result of new management hires during 2022, more than half of our 13-person executive team identifies as female, LGBTQ, and/or a person of color, which represents significant progress as compared to the prior year. 
Training and Talent Development. We promote and support employee development, compliance and organizational effectiveness by providing compliance training and professional development programs. All of our employees take a required annual training on the following topics: our code of conduct and ethics; cybersecurity; diversity and inclusion; and preventing sexual harassment. In addition, in 2022, we added a training on psychological safety at work, which covers ways managers and employees can promote an open, trusting and non-judgmental environment that promotes creativity and the free exchange of ideas. 
Feedback and Coaching. We believe regular feedback is an integral component of employee development, and that creating a culture of ongoing performance coaching is critical to our success. To that end, we conduct quarterly coaching sessions, where each employee is evaluated by their personal manager. Employee performance is assessed in significant part based on the achievement of goals set collaboratively by the employee and their manager. We also encourage managers to provide ongoing feedback and performance coaching to their direct reports, and to solicit their teams’ feedback on their own performance.
Employee Recognition. We regularly recognize our employees for driving business results and exemplifying our company values. We believe that these recognition programs help drive strong employee performance. Employees also have access to an internal communications channel to recognize their peers for their contributions to the company. 
Community Outreach and Support. We believe it is important to promote community outreach through corporate giving and employee volunteerism in the communities where we live and work. We provide each employee with one paid day off each year to participate in volunteer activities of their choice. Beginning in mid-2023, we plan to launch a global social impact platform that will help our employees to find volunteer opportunities and collaborate with colleagues on social impact efforts. 
Monitoring our Progress
We monitor our progress toward the goal of our People Promise by tracking the following metrics:
•Employee Survey Results. As discussed above under “Engagement”, we conduct a comprehensive employee engagement survey annually, and compare results for each survey question from year to year. 
•Employee Turnover. We monitor attrition, voluntary turnover, and total turnover, as a whole and by tenure, region, and by job family. Attrition captures all reasons employees leave, including voluntary turnover and involuntary turnover due to job eliminations or performance reasons, whereas voluntary turnover is limited to elective departures by employees. Total turnover is the sum of attrition plus voluntary turnover. Our voluntary turnover across our global employee base in 2022 was 16%, which we believe compares favorably with global turnover rates in the technology industry. 
•Diversity. As discussed above under “Diversity and Inclusion”, we measure gender diversity at least annually overall, by geography, by job role, and by job level. We also monitor the racial and ethnic diversity of our U.S.-based employees, to the extent that our employees disclose their race and ethnicity to us.
