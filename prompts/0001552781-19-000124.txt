ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 SWK Holdings Corporation (the “Company,” “SWK,” “us” or “we”) was incorporated in July 1996 in California and reincorporated in Delaware in September 1999. In July 2012, we commenced our corporate strategy of building a specialty finance and asset management business. Our strategy is to be a leading healthcare capital provider by offering sophisticated, customized financing solutions to a broad range of life science companies, institutions and inventors. Our focus is on monetizing cash flow streams derived from commercial-stage products and related intellectual property through royalty purchases and financings, as well as through the creation of synthetic revenue interests in commercialized products. We are deploying our assets to earn interest, fees, and other income pursuant to this strategy, and we continue to identify and review financing and similar opportunities on an ongoing basis. In addition, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, SWK Advisors LLC, we provide non-discretionary investment advisory services to institutional clients in separately managed accounts to similarly invest in life science finance. SWK Advisors LLC is registered as an investment advisor with the Texas State Securities Board. We intend to fund transactions through our own working capital, by partnering with other institutional investors, as well as by building our asset management business by raising additional third party capital to be invested alongside our capital.
 We fill a niche that we believe is underserved in the sub-$50 million transaction size. Since many of our competitors that provide non-traditional debt and/or longer term, royalty-related financing options have much greater financial resources than us, they tend not to focus on transaction sizes below $50 million as it is generally inefficient for them to do so. In addition, we do not believe that a sufficient number of other companies offer similar types of long-term financing options to fill the demand of the sub-$50 million market. As such, we believe we face less competition from such investors in transactions that are less than $50 million.
 We evaluate and invest in a broad range of healthcare related companies and products with innovative intellectual property, including the biotechnology, medical device, medical diagnostics and related tools, animal health and pharmaceutical industries (together “life science”), and we tailor our financial solutions to the needs of our business partners. Our business partners are primarily engaged in selling products that directly or indirectly cure diseases and/or improve people’s or animals’ wellness, or they receive royalties paid on the sales of such products. For example, our biotechnology and pharmaceutical business partners manufacture medication that directly treat disease states, whereas our life science tools partners sell a wide variety of research instrumentation to help other companies conduct research into disease states.
 Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio total return and thus increase our net income and book value by generating income from three sources:
 
1. | primarily owning or financing through debt investments, royalties or revenue interests generated by the sales of life science products and related intellectual property; 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | receiving interest and other income by advancing capital in the form of secured debt to companies in the life science sector; and 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | to a lesser extent, realizing capital appreciation from equity-related investments in the life science sector.

In our portfolio we seek to achieve attractive risk-adjusted current yields and opportunities with the potential for equity-like returns with protection that credit provides.
 The majority of our transactions are structured similarly to factoring transactions whereby we provide capital in exchange for an interest in an existing revenue stream. We do not anticipate providing capital in situations prior to the commercialization of a product. The existing revenue stream can take several forms, but is most commonly either a royalty derived from the sales of a life science product (1) from the marketing efforts of a third party, such as a royalty paid to an inventor on the sales of a medicine, or (2) from the marketing efforts of a partner company, such as a medical device company that directly sells its own products. Our structured debt investments may include warrants or other features, giving us the potential to realize enhanced returns on a portion of our portfolio. Capital that we provide directly to our partners is generally used for growth and general working capital purposes, as well as for acquisitions or recapitalizations in select cases. We generally fund the full amount of transactions up to $20 million through our working capital.
 In circumstances where a transaction is greater than $20 million, we seek to syndicate amounts in excess of $20 million to both other investors and our investment advisory clients. We do not expect to earn investment advisory income in transactions where we partner with investors other than our investment advisory clients.
 Our investment advisory agreements are currently non-discretionary, and each client determines individually if it wants to participate in a transaction. Though we have partnered with investment advisory clients in the past, we currently do not have any transactions in which we have partnered with investment advisory clients. We expect to continue to offer transaction opportunities to our investment advisory clients, as appropriate for each client’s investment strategy. When a client opts into a transaction, each client receives its pro rata allocation of income produced by a transaction in which it participates, and the client pays us management and incentive fees according to a written investment advisory agreement. Fees paid by clients may differ depending upon the terms negotiated with each client and are paid directly by the client upon receipt of an invoice from us. We may seek to raise discretionary capital from similar investors in the future.
 We source our investment opportunities through a combination of our senior management’s proprietary relationships within the industry, outbound business development efforts and inbound inquiry from companies, institutions and inventors interested in learning about our capital financing alternatives. Our investment advisory clients generally do not originate investment opportunities for us.
 Tax Attributes
 We view our ability to carry forward our net operating losses, or NOLs, as an important and substantial asset. On January 26, 2006, in order to preserve stockholder value by protecting our ability to carry forward our NOLs, we entered into a rights agreement that provided for a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of our common stock. The purchase rights become exercisable after the acquisition or attempted acquisition of 4.9 percent or more of our outstanding common stock without the prior approval of our board of directors. Our current rights agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) was entered into as of April 8, 2016 and has an expiration date of April 8, 2019. On March 27, 2019, the board of directors approved an extension of the Rights Agreement for another three years. Under the Rights Agreement, Carlson Capital, L.P. and its affiliates (collectively, “Carlson”), are designated as Exempt Persons (as defined in the Rights Agreement) unless they own more than 76 percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock in the aggregate.
 At this time, under current law, we do not anticipate that our life science business strategy will generate sufficient income to permit us to utilize all of our NOLs prior to their respective expiration dates. As such, it is possible that we might pursue additional strategies that we believe might result in our ability to utilize more of our NOLs.
 
Competition
 
Our markets are very competitive. We face competition in the pursuit of outside investors, investment management clients and opportunities to deploy our capital in attractive healthcare related companies. Our primary competitors provide financing to prospective companies and include non-bank financial institutions, federal or state chartered banks, venture debt funds, venture capital funds, private equity funds, pharmaceutical royalty and other investment funds, business development companies and investment banks. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we have. Some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create a competitive disadvantage for us. As a result, we tend not to compete on price, but instead focus on our industry experience, flexible financing options and speed to evaluate and complete a transaction. In addition, since many of our competitors that provide non-traditional debt and/or longer term, royalty-related financing options have much greater financial resources than us, they tend not to focus on transaction sizes below $50 million as it is generally inefficient for them to do so. As such, we believe we face less competition from such investors in transactions that are less than $50 million.
