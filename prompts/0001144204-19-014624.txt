OVERVIEW
 
Mustang Bio, Inc. (“Mustang”, “We”, “Us” or the “Company”) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on translating today’s medical breakthroughs in cell and gene therapies into potential cures for hematologic cancers, solid tumors and rare genetic diseases. We aim to acquire rights to these technologies by licensing or otherwise acquiring an ownership interest in the technologies, funding their research and development and eventually either out-licensing or bringing the technologies to market.
 
Our pipeline is currently focused in three core areas: gene therapy programs for rare genetic disorders, chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) engineered T cell (“CAR T”) therapies for hematologic malignancies and CAR T therapies for solid tumors. For each therapy we have partnered with world class research institutions. For our gene therapy programs, we have partnered with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (“St. Jude”) in the development of a first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral treatment of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (“XSCID”) and for our CAR T therapies we have partnered with the City of Hope National Medical Center (“COH”), Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (“Fred Hutch”) and Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”). 


Gene Therapy
 
In partnership with St. Jude, our gene therapy program (MB-107) is being conducted under an exclusive license to develop a potentially curative treatment for XSCID, a rare genetic immune system condition in which affected patients do not live beyond infancy without treatment. This first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy is currently in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials sponsored by St. Jude and the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”). Results in these two trials have been promising and we plan to transfer St. Jude’s Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) to Mustang in the second half of 2019 following completion of the technology transfer process.
CAR T Therapies
 
Mustang’s pipeline of CAR T therapies is being developed under exclusive licenses from several world class research institutions. Our strategy is to license these technologies, support preclinical and clinical research activities by our partners and transfer the underlying technology to our cell processing facility located in Worcester, Massachusetts to conduct Mustang sponsored clinical trials.
 
We are developing CAR T therapies for hematologic malignancies in partnership with COH targeting CD123 (MB-102) and CS1 (MB-104) and with Fred Hutch targeting CD20 (MB-106). Phase 1 clinical trials sponsored by COH for MB-102 and by Fred Hutch for MB-106 are underway and a COH sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial for MB-104 is scheduled to open during the first half of 2019. Mustang plans to file an IND for the MB-102 program in the first half of 2019 and to initiate a Mustang sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial shortly thereafter for the treatment of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. We expect to file an IND for MB-104 in the second half of 2019 and to initiate a Mustang sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial shortly thereafter for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. We also plan to file an IND and initiate a Mustang sponsored clinical trial for MB-106 for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.


We are also developing CAR T therapies for solid tumors in partnership with COH targeting IL13Ra2 (MB-101), HER2 (MB-103) and PSCA (MB-105). In addition, we have partnered with Nationwide for C134 (MB-108) in order to enhance the activity of MB-101 for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”). Phase 1 clinical trials sponsored by COH for MB-101 and MB-103 are underway, and a COH sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial for MB-105 is scheduled to commence during 2019. A Phase 1 clinical trial for MB-108 is scheduled to commence in the first half of 2019. We also plan to file INDs and initiate Mustang sponsored clinical trials for MB-103 for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer to brain and for the combination of MB-101 and MB-108 for the treatment of patients with GBM. Finally, we plan to file an IND and initiate a Mustang sponsored clinical trial for MB-105 for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer.
 
Additionally, we hold complementary patent licenses relating to the use, delivery and possible enhancement of our proprietary CAR technologies. In particular, we licensed intellectual property from Harvard University pertaining to CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing of CAR T cells, and we hope to use this technology to enhance the activity of our CAR T cell therapies.


To date, we have not received approval for the sale of our product candidates in any market and, therefore, have not generated any product sales from our product candidates. In addition, we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception, and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. As of December 31, 2018, we have an accumulated deficit of $79.1 million. 
 
We are a majority-controlled subsidiary of Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress”).

Gene Therapy for Rare Genetic Disorders

Ex vivo Lentiviral Therapy for X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (MB-107)

X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (“XSCID”) is a rare genetic immune system condition also known as bubble boy disease, in which affected patients do not live beyond infancy without treatment.
 
This first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy has already been given to 13 patients in two early stage clinical trials, with highly encouraging results. Eight patients under the age of two years were treated at St. Jude and UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital San Francisco, with results presented at the 21st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy in 2Q18, and five patients 10-23 years of age were treated in an earlier NIH trial that was published in 2Q16 in Science Translational Medicine.


The existing data from these 13 patients is encouraging. In the initial Phase 1/2 NIH trial, the oldest two of the five patients – all of whom had haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (“HSCT”) in infancy – showed expansion of T, NK, and B cells at 2 to 3 years after treatment. These patients achieved sustained restoration of humoral responses to immunization and experienced clinical improvement. Similar gene marking levels were achieved in the three youngest patients, albeit with only six to nine months of follow-up. This is important because in prior gene therapy trials with murine gammaretroviral vectors without preconditioning, B cell reconstitution did not occur, and patients therefore still required lifelong intravenous immunoglobulin. The low-dose, nonmyeloablative busulfan pretreatment conditioning was well tolerated, and of a low enough intensity to avoid the need for transfusions of red blood cells or platelets.
 
Subsequent to the initiation of the NIH trial, eight patients under two years old who had not previously undergone HSCT were treated with the ex-vivo gene therapy in a St. Jude/UCSF Phase 1/2 trial, resulting in highly encouraging results. Low-dose busulfan conditioning caused adverse events in only two patients (mild mucositis; mucositis, hair loss), and no patients required blood product support. Six of the eight patients achieved reconstituted T cells within the first half-year, and a seventh patient reconstituted T cells within several months after a gene therapy “boost” that was administered after one year of follow-up. In the final patient, the follow-up was only two months, though clearance of aphthous ulcers suggested early immune recovery. Three of the patients were able to discontinue monthly infusions of intravenous immunoglobulin. In the five patients who had infections at the time of therapy, all infections resolved completely. 


CAR T Therapies for Hematologic Malignancies
 
CD123 CAR T cell Program for AML (MB-102)
 
CD123 is a subunit of the heterodimeric interleukin-3-receptor (“IL-3R”) which is widely expressed on human hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”). In addition, CD123 can be found on the surface of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“B-ALL”), hairy cell leukemia, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (“BPDCN”), chronic myeloid leukemia (“CML”) and Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Of these malignancies, we are currently investigating CD123 as a target for adoptive cellular immunotherapy in AML and BPDCN, since high CD123 expression is associated with enhanced AML blast proliferation, increased resistance of blasts to apoptosis, and poor clinical prognosis. CD123 is overexpressed in the vast majority of cases of AML and in essentially all cases of BPDCN.
 
Acute myeloid leukemia is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells characterized by rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow. AML is the most common form of acute leukemia. Although AML is a relatively rare disease, there are approximately 20,000 new cases per year in the US and 10,000 deaths per year, accounting for approximately 1.8% of cancer deaths in the US [The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute]. AML standard of care involves chemotherapy to induce remission followed by additional chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the preferred treatment route for AML following a second remission. It can lead to a 5-year disease-free survival in 26% of patients. Unfortunately, however, currently only about half of relapsed patients are able to achieve a second remission with traditional chemotherapy agents. Patients who do not achieve a second remission are much less likely to benefit from transplantation and face a dismal outcome.


BPDCN is categorized by the World Health Organization under AML. Most often, BPDCN presents with features of both lymphoma and leukemia. There are little data about BPDCN and the only approved drug for this disease is tagraxofusp, which is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with both treatment-naïve and previously-treated BPDCN. The average age at diagnosis is 60 to 70 years. BPDCN is very often misdiagnosed and under-reported. The skin is the most frequently involved site of disease (80 percent of cases). However, BPDCN usually progresses with bone marrow involvement and a decrease in red blood cell, white blood cell and platelet counts. The lymph nodes and spleen may also be involved. Common misdiagnoses for BPCDN include non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”), AML, leukemia cutis [a nonspecific term used for cutaneous (skin) manifestation of any type of leukemia], melanoma (a type of skin cancer), and lupus erythematosus (chronic inflammatory disease that occurs when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues and organs). There are no data or clinical trials that can define the best first treatment for patients with BPDCN. In addition to the emerging use of tagraxofusp, which was approved by the FDA in December 2018, treatment sometimes includes therapies that are used for AML, ALL, or lymphoma. The time for which a patient responds to these treatments is usually short. After a relapse, second remissions with conventional chemotherapy are difficult to achieve. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (“allo-SCT”), especially if offered in first remission, may result in longer remissions. The current recommendation is for BPDCN patients to be evaluated for an allo-SCT as soon as possible and to begin searching for a donor.
 
The use of CAR T immunotherapy in relapsed AML and BPDCN patients may offer the potential to achieve a complete or longer lasting remission. We have developed CD123-targeted CAR T cells designed both to be activated to proliferate and to kill CD123-expressing tumor cells [Mardiros A et al. Blood. 2013;122(18):3138-3148]. The therapy is designed to recognize and eliminate leukemic cells, leading to remission in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, and could serve as a bridge to potentially curative allogeneic stem cell transplant. The manufacturing process genetically modifies T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in order to express a CD123-specific, hinge-optimized, CD28 co-stimulatory domain-expressing CAR.


CD20 CAR T cell Program for B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (MB-106)
 
CD20 is a promising target for immunotherapy of B-cell lymphomas. CD20 is a B-cell lineage-specific phosphoprotein that is expressed in high, homogeneous density on the surface of more than 95% of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”). CD20 is stable on the cell surface with minimal shedding or internalization upon binding antibody and is present at only nanomolar levels as soluble antigen. It is well established as an effective immunotherapy target, with extensive studies demonstrating improved tumor responses and survival of B-NHL patients treated with rituximab and other anti-CD20 antibodies. Importantly, CD20 continues to be expressed on the lymphoma cells of most patients with relapsed B-NHL despite repetitive rituximab treatments, and loss of CD20 expression is not a major contributor to treatment resistance. Thus, there is strong rationale for testing CD20 CAR T cells as an immunotherapy for NHL.


More than 70,000 new cases of NHL are diagnosed each year in the United States, and more than 19,000 patients die of this group of diseases annually. Most forms of NHL including follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma, which account collectively for ~45% of all cases of NHL, are incurable with available therapies, except for allo-SCT. However, many NHL patients are not suitable candidates for allo-SCT, and this treatment is also limited by significant rates of morbidity and mortality due to graft versus host disease. Aggressive B-cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma account for 30-35% of NHL. The majority of patients with aggressive B-NHL are successfully treated with combination chemotherapy, but a significant proportion relapse or have refractory disease, and the outcome of these patients is poor. Innovative new treatments are therefore urgently needed.


Fred Hutch has an open IND for a Phase 1 clinical study to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of administering CD20-directed CAR T cells; as of December 31, 2018, five patients have been treated. This IND was submitted on February 24, 2017, with Fred Hutch as the sponsor. The trial will also assess the T cell persistence and determine the potential immunogenicity of the cells, and Mustang together with Fred Hutch will determine a recommended Phase 2 dose.

CS1 CAR T for Multiple Myeloma and Light Chain Amyloidosis (MB-104)
 
CS1 (also known as CD319, CRACC and SLAMF7) was identified as an NK cell receptor regulating immune functions. It is also expressed on B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, NK-T cells, and monocytes. CS1 is overexpressed in multiple myeloma (“MM”) and light chain amyloidosis (“AL”), which makes it a good target for immunotherapy. A humanized anti-CS1 antibody, elotuzumab (EmplicitiÔ), has shown promising results in clinical studies. Despite great advances in treatment, MM remains an incurable malignancy of plasma cells. AL is a protein deposition disorder that is a result of a plasma cell dysplasia, similar to MM. Immunotherapy is an attractive approach for AL because of the low burden of disease. Our academic partners at COH have developed a novel second generation CS1-specific CAR T cell therapy. In pre-clinical studies, they have demonstrated efficacy of these CAR T cells, both in vitro and in vivo, within the context of clinically relevant models of MM and AL. COH will be evaluating the safety of this CS1-specific CAR T cell therapy in a Phase 1/2 trial that is scheduled to commence in the first half of 2019.
CAR T Therapies for Solid Tumors
 
IL13Ra2 CAR T Cell Program for Glioblastoma (MB-101)
 
Glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”) is the most common brain and central nervous system (“CNS”) cancer, accounting for 45.2% of malignant primary brain and CNS tumors, 54% of all gliomas, and 16% of all primary brain and CNS tumors. An estimated 12,390 new glioblastoma cases were predicted in 2017 in the US. Malignant brain tumors are the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in adolescents and young adults aged 15-39 and the most common cancer occurring among 15-19 year-olds in the US. While GBM is a rare disease (2-3 cases per 100,000 persons per year in the US and EU), it is quite lethal, with five-year survival rates historically under 10%. Standard of care therapy consists of maximal surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide, which, while rarely curative, is shown to extend median overall survival from 4.5 to 15 months. GBM remains difficult to treat due to the inherent resistance of the tumor to conventional therapies.


Immunotherapy approaches targeting brain tumors offer promise over conventional treatments. IL13Ra2 is an attractive target for CAR T therapy, as it has limited expression in normal tissue but is overexpressed on the surface of greater than 50% of GBMs. CAR T cells are designed to express membrane-tethered IL-13 receptor ligand (“IL-13”) mutated at a single site (glutamic acid at position 13 to a tyrosine; E13Y) with high affinity for IL13Rα2 and reduced binding to IL13Ra1 in order to reduce healthy tissue targeting (Kahlon KS et al. Cancer Research. 2004;64:9160-9166).


We are developing an optimized CAR T product incorporating enhancements in CAR T design and T cell engineering to improve antitumor potency and T cell persistence. We include a second-generation hinge-optimized CAR containing mutations in the IgG4 linker to reduce off-target Fc interactions (Jonnalagadda M et al. Molecular Therapy. 2015;23(4):757-768.). We also include the 4-1BB (CD137) co-stimulatory signaling domain for improved survival and maintenance of CAR T cells. Finally, we incorporate the extracellular domain of CD19 as a selection/tracking marker. In order to further improve persistence, either central memory T-cells (TCM; Arms 1 – 4) or enriched CD62L+ naïve and memory T cells (TN/MEM; Arm 5) are isolated and enriched. The manufacturing process limits ex vivo expansion, which is designed to reduce T cell exhaustion and maintain a TCM or TN/MEM phenotype. These CAR modified TCM and TN/MEM cells are shown to be more potent and persistent than earlier generations of CAR T cells, based on experiments with CAR Ts in mouse xenograft models of GBM.
 
Our academic partners at COH have an open IND to assess the feasibility and safety of using TCM or TN/MEM enriched IL13Ra2-specific CAR engineered T cells for clinical study participants with recurrent/refractory malignant glioma. This IND was submitted in October 2014, with COH as the sponsor. COH has enrolled and treated 53 patients as of December 31, 2018. In the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in April 2018, our collaborators at COH presented the preliminary data for patients enrolled on Arm 2 of the protocol (the “Intracavitary Arm”). The investigators reported that the CAR T cells were well-tolerated, meaning that no dose-limiting toxicities were seen to date. The investigators also reported on a patient that they determined had a complete response to treatment based on the imaging and clinical features set forth by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO). This clinical response was sustained for 7.5 months after the initiation of CAR T-cell therapy; however, this patient’s disease eventually recurred at four new locations that were distinct and non-adjacent to the original tumors. The next step is to continue to enroll patients in this Phase 1 study to determine the maximum tolerated dose and a recommended Phase 2 dose. Additionally, in this Phase 1 study, we are exploring optimal modes of delivery for CAR T cells for the treatment of GBM and optimal T cell selection.
 
HER2 CAR T for GBM & Metastatic Breast Cancer to Brain (MB-103)
 
HER2/neu (often shortened to “HER2”) is a growth-promoting protein on the outside of all breast cells. Breast cancer cells with higher than normal levels of HER2 are called HER2-positive (“HER2+”). These cancers tend to grow and spread faster than other breast cancers. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, with over 40,000 women in the United States expected to die from advanced metastatic disease in 2018. Approximately 20% to 25% of breast cancers overexpress HER2, which is an established therapeutic target of both monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. With the advent of effective mAbs directed against HER2, the median overall survival of patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer has improved. However, management of metastatic disease in the brain and/or central nervous system (CNS), observed in up to 50% of HER2+ breast cancer patients, continues to be a clinical challenge in large part due to the inability of mAbs to sufficiently cross the blood-brain barrier. Although small-molecule inhibitors of HER2 exist and have been clinically approved, their single-agent efficacy in the context of metastatic disease to the brain has been limited. While HER2-targeted therapy in combination with conventional agents has shown some promise for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer, control of brain metastases remains a significant unmet clinical need, as most patients survive less than two years following CNS involvement. Recent advances in cellular immunotherapy approaches have underscored the potential for potent antitumor immune responses and clinical benefit against solid cancers, and these approaches may be effective in the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain. Likewise, HER2 has been suggested as a suitable target for glioblastoma (GBM), wherein elevated HER2 protein levels have been correlated with impaired survival.

CAR-based T-cell immunotherapy is being actively investigated for the treatment of solid tumors, including HER2+ cancers. Our academic partners at COH have developed a second-generation HER2-specific CAR T-cell for the treatment of breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain, as well as for the treatment of refractory/relapsed HER2+ GBM. COH’s preclinical data demonstrate effective targeting of breast cancer brain metastases with intraventricular delivery of HER2-BB CAR T cells. COH will be evaluating the safety of this HER2-specific CAR T cell therapy in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials that commenced in Q4 2018.
 
PSCA CAR T for Prostate & Pancreatic Cancers (MB-105)
 
PSCA is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell membrane glycoprotein. In addition to being highly expressed in the prostate it is also expressed in the bladder, placenta, colon, kidney, and stomach. This gene is upregulated in a large proportion of prostate cancers and is also detected in cancers of the bladder and pancreas. The gene includes a polymorphism that results in an upstream start codon in some individuals; this polymorphism is thought to be associated with a risk for certain gastric and bladder cancers. Prostate cancer may be amenable to T cell-based immunotherapy since several tumor antigens, including prostate stem-cell antigen (“PSCA”), are widely over-expressed in metastatic disease. Our academic partners at COH have developed a second-generation PSCA specific CAR T cell therapy that has demonstrated robust in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity in patient-derived, clinically relevant, bone-metastatic prostate cancer xenograft models. COH will be evaluating the safety of this PSCA-specific CAR T cell therapy in a Phase 1/2 trial that is scheduled to commence in the second half of 2019.
 
Technology to Convert GBM from an Immunologically Cold Tumor to an Immunologically Hot Tumor
 
HSV-1 oncolytic virus C134 (MB-108)
 
C134 is a next-generation oncolytic herpes simplex virus (“oHSV”) that is conditionally replication competent; that is, it can replicate in tumor cells, but not in normal cells, thus killing the tumor cells directly through this process. Replication of C134 in the tumor itself not only kills the infected tumor cells but causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are released as the tumor cell dies and can then proceed to infect other tumor cells in the vicinity and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic activity, the virus promotes an immune response against surviving tumor cells, which increases the antitumor effect of the therapy. The virus expresses a gene from another virus from the same overall virus family, human cytomegalovirus, that allows it to replicate better in the tumor cells than its first-generation predecessors. However, the virus has also been genetically engineered to minimize the production of any toxic effects for the patient receiving the therapy.


To improve this virus over its first-generation predecessors, modifications have focused on improving viral replication, spread within the tumor bed, and enhancing bystander damage to uninfected tumor cells. These effects cumulatively should result in converting an immunologically cold tumor to an immunologically hot tumor, which Mustang anticipates will increase the efficacy of its IL13Rα2-direct CAR T for the treatment of GBM.
 
The University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”) is the clinical trial site for the Phase 1 trial of C134, and they have filed an IND for an investigator-initiated Phase 1 trial that we expect will start enrolling patients in the first half of 2019. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of stereotactic intracerebral injections of escalating doses of C134 virus, and to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of C134. Secondary objectives are to obtain preliminary information about the potential benefit of C134 in the treatment of patients with recurrent malignant gliomas, including relevant data on markers of efficacy, including time to tumor progression and patient survival. 


INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS

General
 
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the US and in other countries.  Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broad intellectual property protection for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the US and elsewhere in the world.
 
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors (“know-how”). To help protect our proprietary know-how which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests.  To this end, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions that they generate or make, and which are important to our business.

Patents and other proprietary rights are crucial to the development of our business. We will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents, supported by regulatory exclusivity or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We have a few patents and patent applications related to our compounds and other technology, but we cannot guarantee the scope of protection of the issued patents, or that such patents will survive a validity or enforceability challenge, or that any of the pending patent applications will issue as patents.
 
Generally, patent applications in the US are maintained in secrecy for a period of 18 months or more. There is even an opportunity under specific circumstances to keep the contents of patent applications hidden until the patent application matures to an issued patent. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents, or their enforceability. To date, there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents. Third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications, if issued. If our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the US that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings declared by the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before we commercialize any of our products, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patent. However, the life of a patent covering a product that has been subject to regulatory approval may have the ability to be extended through the patent restoration program, although any such extension could still be minimal. Additionally, statutory caps impose further limitation on any such extensions. 


If a patent is issued to a third party containing one or more preclusive or conflicting claims, and those claims are ultimately determined to be valid and enforceable, we may be required to obtain a license, if available, under such patent or to develop or obtain alternative technology. In the event of litigation involving a third-party claim, an adverse outcome in the litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to such third party, require us to seek a license for the disputed rights from such third party, and/or require us to cease use of the technology. Further, our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to technology required to commercialize our products may seriously harm our business. We also may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Litigation would not only involve substantial costs but would also involve substantial time commitments on the part of our key executives and research and development personnel.


In March 2015, we licensed intellectual property related to CAR T technology from COH. The intellectual property licensed thereunder includes two granted US patents and pending patent applications in a number of countries, including the US and the EU, as well as pending patent applications in Japan, China, South Korea, Australia and the developing world. These granted patents include claims directed to nucleic acids and expression vectors encoding CARs targeting IL13Rα2 and CD123. The granted patents and any patents maturing from these pending applications will expire no sooner than October 2033. The pending applications in these patent families also include various claims relating to CARs, T cells that express the CARs, methods of treatment utilizing the CAR T cells and additional specific features to optimize administration of CAR T cells, targeting, binding specificity, cell stimulation and persistence. Additional applications and pending claims from COH that we have rights to include the use of optimized hinge region for many targeted CAR constructions such as CD19 along with compositions and methods to isolate and transfect T memory cells to improve cellular persistence, as well as applications and claims related to CS1-, HER2-, and PSCA-targeted CARs.


Also in March 2015, we executed a sponsored research agreement with COH, pursuant to which research is performed in the laboratory of Drs. Stephen Forman and Christine Brown. The sponsored research agreement gives us the right to first negotiation under specified maximum terms regarding any future inventions arising from the laboratory.
 
In May 2017, we licensed intellectual property related to CAR T technology for targeting CD20 from Fred Hutch. The intellectual property includes an international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (i.e., a PCT application), which has now entered the national stage of multiple countries including the US, EU, Japan, China, and Canada, among others. These applications contain claims relating to various CD20-targeting CAR constructs and CAR T cells, as well as methods of making and using the same. In May 2018, national stage applications claiming priority to the PCT application were filed in several jurisdictions around the world, including the US and Europe, in order to begin substantive examination of the claims. Patents maturing from these national stage applications will expire no sooner than March 2037.


In March 2017, we licensed intellectual property related to antibodies and binding agents that specifically bind to PSCA from the University of California Los Angeles (“UCLA”). The intellectual property includes multiple granted patents and pending applications from around the world including the US, EU, Japan, China, and Canada. The granted patents and patents maturing from the pending applications will expire no sooner than March 2027.
 
In November 2017, we licensed intellectual property related to the use of CRISPR technology in preparing CAR T cells from Harvard. The intellectual property includes one granted US patent and multiple pending US and foreign applications. The granted patent and patents maturing from the pending applications will expire no sooner than April 2024.


In August 2018, we licensed from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital XSCID Technology related to an ex vivo lentiviral vector gene therapy program to provide a normal copy of the IL2RG gene to patients born with XSCID.


In February 2019, we licensed Material and Technical Information related to the HSV-1 oncolytic virus C134 from Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. 
 
In total, we have in-licensed six granted patents and twelve pending applications in the US, with counterparts pending in foreign jurisdictions, for most of the patent families, in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Korea, Russia, Japan, Hong Kong, Israel, and Mexico and New Zealand.
 
In addition to the technology the company has in-licensed, Mustang has also developed its own proprietary intellectual property, both alone and in conjunction with COH. In particular Mustang filed a US provisional application directed to optimized methods for manufacturing cell-based therapeutics, and Mustang and COH, as co-applicants, filed a US provisional application directed to methods of treating hematological cancers.

Other Intellectual Property Rights
 
We depend upon trademarks, trade secrets, knowhow and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. To maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we require our employees, scientific advisors, consultants and collaborators, upon commencement of a relationship with us, to execute confidentiality agreements and, in the case of parties other than our research and development collaborators, to agree to assign their inventions to us. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed in connection with their relationship with us. These agreements may not, however, provide protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.
 
In addition to patent protection, we may utilize orphan drug regulations or other provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended, or FDCA, to provide market exclusivity for certain of our product candidates. Orphan drug regulations provide incentives to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases, currently defined as diseases that exist in fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US, or diseases that affect more than 200,000 individuals in the US but for which the sponsor does not realistically anticipate will generate a net profit. Under these provisions, a manufacturer of a designated orphan drug can seek tax benefits, and the holder of the first approval of a designated orphan product from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), will be granted a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity for such FDA approved orphan product.

COMPETITION
 
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel, attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and license technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry, we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors.
 
The drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same conditions that we are targeting. Other companies have products or product candidates in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical development, or with marketing approvals, to treat conditions for which we are also seeking to discover and develop product candidates. Some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our product candidates and may be commercialized earlier.
 
The field of CAR T therapy is extremely active. Companies and partnerships currently engaged in clinical trials with CAR T modalities include Celgene, Novartis/University of Pennsylvania, Bluebird Bio, Celgene/Baylor College of Medicine, Allogene, Cellectis, Gilead, Bellicum, MD Anderson/Ziopharm, Atara Biotherapeutics, Celyad, Autolus and Intrexon.


The gene therapy field is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We are aware of companies currently engaged in developing gene therapies in various indications, including Abeona Therapeutics, Adverum Biotechnologies, Audentes Therapeutics, AVROBIO, Axovant Sciences, Bluebird Bio, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Krystal Biotech, MeiraGTx, Nightstar Therapeutics, Orchard Therapeutics, REGENXBIO, Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Sarepta Therapeutics, Solid Biosciences, Spark Therapeutics, Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals, uniQure and Voyager Therapeutics, as well as several companies addressing other methods for delivering or modifying genes and regulating gene expression.


EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had thirty-eight full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our employee relations to be good. Employees of Fortress also make valuable financial, legal, scientific and other strategic contributions to Mustang on a regular basis.
SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING
 
As an early stage development company, we rely on our research partners to manufacture all materials currently used in the clinical development programs we are sponsoring at COH, Fred Hutch, St. Jude, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”) under the IND applications filed by these institutions. UAB is the clinical trial site for the Phase 1 trial of Nationwide’s C134 oncolytic virus. Pursuant to the March 2015 Licensing Agreement with COH, we have the right to make and have made the products, and we have negotiated Investigator-Initiated Clinical Research Support Agreements with COH and Fred Hutch which specify the manufacturing costs and numbers of patients which will be supplied under filed protocols. Our research partners have extensive experience manufacturing clinical materials for development studies, but we are currently dependent on both their capacity limitations and continued operating success.


We have limited experience in processing cells for clinical or commercial purposes. In 2018 we opened our own cell processing facility in Worcester, Massachusetts, in order to manufacture and supply product candidates for all clinical trials that will be conducted under IND applications to be filed by us. We are preparing to file our first IND in the first half of 2019. As with any supply program, obtaining raw materials of the correct quality cannot be guaranteed, and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in this endeavor.


We expect to rely on contract manufacturing relationships for any non-CAR T products that we may in-license or acquire in the future for co-administration with our CAR T products. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contract with such manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
Contract manufacturers for these potential future non-CAR T products would be subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other state and federal regulations. Our contractors, if any, in Europe would face similar challenges from the numerous EU and member state regulatory agencies and authorized bodies. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards, other than through contractual obligations. If they are deemed out of compliance with cGMPs, product recalls could result, inventory could be destroyed, production could be stopped, and supplies could be delayed or otherwise disrupted. 



12
--

 

If we need to change manufacturers for these potential future non-CAR T products after commercialization, the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these new manufacturers in advance, which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with FDA regulations and standards and may require significant lead times and delay. Furthermore, switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATIONS
 
Numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies, impose substantial regulations upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of our product candidates, as well as our ongoing research and development activities. None of our product candidates has been approved for sale in any market in which we have marketing rights. Before marketing in the US, any drug that we develop must undergo rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the FDCA. The FDA regulates, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, approval, manufacturing, record keeping, adverse event reporting, packaging, labeling, storage, advertising, promotion, export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products.
 
The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. We are required to submit extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication or use to establish a product candidate’s safety and efficacy before we can secure FDA approval to market or sell a product in the US. The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies or surveillance. Before commencing clinical trials in humans, we must submit an IND to the FDA containing, among other things, pre-clinical data, chemistry, manufacturing and control information, and an investigative plan. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.


The FDA may permit expedited development, evaluation, and marketing of new therapies intended to treat persons with serious or life-threatening conditions for which there is an unmet medical need under its fast track drug development programs. A sponsor can apply for fast track designation at the time of submission of an IND, or at any time prior to receiving marketing approval of the new drug application (NDA). To receive fast track designation, an applicant must demonstrate:
 

· | that the drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | that the drug is intended to treat a serious aspect of the condition; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs, and this potential is being evaluated in the planned drug development program.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA must respond to a request for fast track designation within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Over the course of drug development, a product in a fast track development program must continue to meet the criteria for fast track designation. Sponsors of products in fast track drug development programs must be in regular contact with the reviewing division of the FDA to ensure that the evidence necessary to support marketing approval will be developed and presented in a format conducive to an efficient review. Sponsors of products in fast track drug development programs ordinarily are eligible for priority review of a completed application in six months or less and also may be permitted to submit portions of an NDA to the FDA for review before the complete application is submitted.
 
Sponsors of drugs designated as fast track also may seek approval under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations. Under this authority, the FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence, to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. Approval will be subject to the requirement that the applicant study the drug further to verify and describe its clinical benefit where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate endpoint to clinical benefit or uncertainty as to the relation of the observed clinical benefit to ultimate outcome.  Post-marketing studies are usually underway at the time an applicant files the NDA.  When required to be conducted, such post-marketing studies must also be adequate and well-controlled.  The applicant must carry out any such post-marketing studies with due diligence. Many companies who have been granted the right to utilize an accelerated approval approach have failed to obtain approval. Moreover, negative or inconclusive results from the clinical trials we hope to conduct or adverse medical events could cause us to have to repeat or terminate the clinical trials. Accordingly, we may not be able to complete the clinical trials within an acceptable time frame, if at all, and, therefore, could not submit the NDA to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for marketing approval.


Clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices, and must be conducted pursuant to an IND, unless exempted.
 

13
--

 

For purposes of NDA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases:
 

· | Phase 1: The drug is administered to a small group of humans, either healthy volunteers or patients, to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2: Studies are conducted on a larger number of patients to assess the efficacy of the product, to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse events.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3: Studies establish safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 4: The FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to find out more about the drug’s long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use, or to test the drug in different populations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or that may increase the costs of these trials, include:
 

· | slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials or delays in approvals from a study site’s review board;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy or determine the appropriate product dose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | insufficient supply of the product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | ineffectiveness of the product candidates.
--+-------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the FDA, equivalent foreign regulatory authority, or a data safety monitoring committee for a trial may place a clinical trial on hold or terminate it if it concludes that subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, or for futility. Any drug is likely to produce some toxicity or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for a sufficiently long period of time. Unacceptable toxicity or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a product candidate, known as toxicological studies, or clinical trials of product candidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our product candidates and could ultimately prevent approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.
 
Sponsors of drugs may apply for a special protocol assessment (SPA) from the FDA. The SPA process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to form the basis for an NDA. However, final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the Phase 3 trial. The SPA may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product safety or efficacy. 


Before receiving FDA approval to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for its intended use by submitting to the FDA an NDA containing the pre-clinical and clinical data that have been accumulated, together with chemistry and manufacturing and controls specifications and information, and proposed labeling, among other things. The FDA may refuse to accept an NDA for filing if certain content criteria are not met and, even after accepting an NDA, the FDA may often require additional information, including clinical data, before approval of marketing a product.


It is also becoming more common for the FDA to request a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as part of an NDA. The REMS plan contains post-market obligations of the sponsor to train prescribing physicians, monitor off-label drug use, and conduct sufficient Phase 4 follow-up studies and registries to ensure the continued safe use of the drug.
 
As part of the approval process, the FDA must inspect and approve each manufacturing facility. Among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. Manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort to ensure continued compliance, and the FDA conducts periodic inspections to certify compliance. It may be difficult for our manufacturers or us to comply with the applicable cGMP, as interpreted by the FDA, and other FDA regulatory requirements. If we, or our contract manufacturers, fail to comply, then the FDA may not allow us to market products that have been affected by the failure.
 

14
--

 

If the FDA grants approval, the approval will be limited to those conditions and patient populations for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies. Further, a product may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved in the NDA. Certain changes to an approved NDA, including, with certain exceptions, any significant changes to labeling, require approval of a supplemental application before the drug may be marketed as changed. Any products that we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing monitoring and regulation by the FDA, including compliance with cGMP and the reporting of adverse experiences with the drugs. The nature of marketing claims that the FDA will permit us to make in the labeling and advertising of our products will generally be limited to those specified in FDA approved labeling, and the advertising of our products will be subject to comprehensive monitoring and regulation by the FDA. Drugs whose review was accelerated may carry additional restrictions on marketing activities, including the requirement that all promotional materials are pre-submitted to the FDA. Claims exceeding those contained in approved labeling will constitute a violation of the FDCA. Violations of the FDCA or regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or marketing and sale following approval may result in agency enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, recall, seizure of products, warning letters, injunctions, fines and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of new drugs are subject to future changes.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the US, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
In the US and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state health care legislation and regulations, including regulations that will be issued to implement provisions of the health care reform legislation enacted in 2010, known as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act and further changes in the law or regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.
International Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the US, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
