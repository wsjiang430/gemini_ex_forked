Overview and Available Information

Horace Mann Educators Corporation (HMEC; and together with its subsidiaries, the Company or Horace Mann) is an insurance holding company incorporated in Delaware. Through its subsidiaries, HMEC markets and underwrites personal lines of property and casualty (primarily personal lines of automobile and property) insurance, retirement products (primarily tax-qualified annuities) and life insurance in the U.S. HMEC's principal insurance subsidiaries are Horace Mann Life Insurance Company (HMLIC), Horace Mann Insurance Company (HMIC), Horace Mann Property & Casualty Insurance Company (HMPCIC) and Teachers Insurance Company (TIC), each of which is an Illinois corporation, and Horace Mann Lloyds (HM Lloyds), an insurance company domiciled in Texas.

Founded by Educators for Educators®, the Company markets its products primarily to K-12 teachers, administrators and other employees of public schools and their families. The Company's nearly one million customers typically have moderate annual incomes, with many belonging to two-income households. Their financial planning tends to focus on retirement, security, savings and primary insurance needs. Management believes that Horace Mann is the largest national multi-line insurance company focused on the nation's educators as its primary market.

Horace Mann markets and services its products primarily through a dedicated sales force of full-time Exclusive Distributors supported by the Company's Customer Contact Center. These agents sell Horace Mann's products and limited additional third-party vendor products. Some of these agents are former educators or individuals with close ties to the educational community who utilize their contacts within, and knowledge of, the target market.

The Company's insurance premiums written and contract deposits* for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.2 billion and net income was $18.3 million. The Company's total assets were $11.0 billion at December 31, 2018. The Company's investment portfolio had an aggregate fair value of $8.3 billion at December 31, 2018 and consisted primarily of investment grade, publicly traded fixed maturity securities.

The Company conducts and manages its business through four reporting segments. The three operating segments, representing the major lines of insurance business, are: Property and Casualty, Retirement and Life. The Company does not allocate the impact of corporate-level transactions to the three operating segments, consistent with the basis for management's evaluation of the results of those segments, but classifies those items in the fourth reporting segment, Corporate and Other. Property and Casualty, Retirement, and Life accounted for 55.2%, 35.5% and 9.3%, respectively, of the Company's insurance premiums written and contract deposits for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The Company is one of the largest participants in the K-12 educator portion of the 403(b) tax-qualified annuity market, measured by 403(b) net written premium on a statutory accounting basis. The Company's 403(b) tax-qualified annuities are voluntarily purchased by individuals employed by public school systems or other tax-exempt organizations through the employee benefit plans of those entities. The Company has 403(b) payroll deduction capabilities utilized by approximately 30% of the 13,200 public school districts in the U.S.

The Company's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge through the Investors section of the Company's website, www.horacemann.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The Company filed with the SEC, as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, the CEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) certifications required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
History

The Company's business was founded in Springfield, Illinois in 1945 by two school teachers to sell automobile insurance to other teachers within Illinois. The Company expanded its business to other states and broadened its product line to include life insurance in 1949, 403(b) tax-qualified retirement annuities in 1961 and property insurance in 1965. In November 1991, HMEC completed an initial public offering of its common stock. The common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol HMN.
Corporate Strategy
The Horace Mann vision is to be the company of choice to provide financial solutions for all educators and others who serve their communities. Management believes the unique value of the Company is providing solutions tailored for educators at each stage of their lives, empowering them to achieve lifelong financial success.
Education Market
Horace Mann serves customers in roughly one-third of the K-12 public school districts in the U.S., with significant opportunity to grow in this niche market. The U.S. Department of Education estimates that there are approximately 6.4 million K-12 public school teachers, administrators and support staff nationwide, a number that is steadily growing. Adjacent markets such as private education staff offer further opportunity.
Because of the focus on this niche market, the Company has a homogeneous customer set with similar characteristics and preferred risk profiles. This allows for more precise underwriting processes and more targeted marketing operations, amplifying the benefit of successful approaches.
In addition, the Company has taken steps to increase its "business-to-business" value to administrators and business officials who make decisions on financial solution providers at the school district level.
Growth Strategy
Horace Mann is implementing a long-term growth strategy designed to provide solutions for the full range of the education market’s financial needs through "PDI": 

• | Products designed to meet educators’ needs and protect their unique risks;


• | Knowledgeable, trusted distribution tailored to educator preferences; and


• | Modern, scalable infrastructure that is easy to do business with.

The Company has undertaken a continuous business development process to analyze how to best achieve these strategic objectives: To build capabilities internally, leveraging internal resources; to partner with organizations with specific expertise; or to take advantage of unique opportunities to purchase specific elements to accelerate profitable growth over the long term. 
Taking advantage of internal subject matter experts and institutional knowledge, product development has largely been completed internally. In particular, the Retirement and Life product suites have been updated to offer more contemporary investment options with features that meet educators’ risk tolerances. 
For coverages Horace Mann does not have the scale or risk tolerance to offer, the Company identifies partners and executes agreements to sell their products through the Horace Mann General Agency. This allows Horace Mann to be the primary point of contact for customers’ financial needs, building brand affinity and loyalty.
In some cases inorganic development has made the most sense financially, and the Company decided to acquire capabilities. In 2018, the Company announced plans to acquire:

• | National Teachers Associates (NTA), a fellow insurer focused on the education market with complementary products and distribution. Headquartered in a suburb of Dallas, family-owned NTA specializes in developing, marketing and underwriting supplemental insurance products, including cancer and heart.


• | Benefit Consultants Group (BCG), a retirement plan provider with strong employer plan infrastructure and competencies based in Cherry Hill, NJ. BCG expands Horace Mann’s strategic capabilities in the retirement market.

Relevant Products
At the core of Horace Mann’s value proposition is the commitment to providing relevant products and solutions to address the issues that educators face at each stage of their career and life. For example:
For young educators new to the profession, student loan debt often precludes saving for retirement, at the point when those savings would have the most time to grow and make a significant impact at retirement age. Through the Company’s Student Loan Solutions program, educators receive complimentary financial guidance to pursue public servant forgiveness or alternate repayment programs, or consolidate loans at a lower rate, freeing up money to begin a savings program. 
For mid-career educators, protecting their loved ones and assets in case of the unexpected becomes a priority. Horace Mann helps provide security and peace of mind by using a consultative sales approach for life insurance and property and casualty coverages. 
For educators preparing to retire, the viability of their pension and retirement plans is top of mind. Horace Mann agents are well-versed in state teacher retirement systems, and can help with retirement income modeling and supplemental plans.
Other solutions are valuable to educators across all career stages. A recurring issue for a majority of teachers is spending their own money on classroom supplies. Horace Mann trains its agents to provide in-school workshops on how to optimize classroom crowdfunding opportunities, primarily DonorsChoose.org, to free up money to put toward educators’ own financial goals.
With the acquisition of NTA, the Company will be able to address educators’ need for supplemental insurance, such as cancer, heart and accident. The defined dollar benefit can be used for medical or non-medical costs of an accident, illness or health emergency, which can help customers address unexpected issues without needing to draw down retirement or other savings. 
Trusted Distribution
Horace Mann aims to provide multiple complementary distribution channels to meet individual educator preferences. The largest component of this strategy is the Company’s more than 700 Exclusive Distributors with strong school district relationships. These local agents serve as a school district partner, providing financial wellness workshops in schools, consulting with educators and administrators, and supporting school events and activities. This trusted adviser model builds particularly strong brand loyalty and affinity. With the acquisition of NTA, the Company will gain more than 200 additional captive agents in largely complementary geographies. 
To build brand awareness and encourage market access, the Company partners with multiple national, state and local associations to reach educators. Through strategic alliances with the American Association of School Administrators (AASA), The School Superintendents Association; and the Association of School Business Officials (ASBO), the Company builds relationships with administrators. Through partnerships with the National Education Association (NEA), as well as state and local affiliates, the Company can build credibility with individual educators.
To meet the preferences of customers who prefer "on demand" services, the Company’s direct sales team can provide coverage over the phone. Customers can secure auto, home and life quote and coverage comparisons online.
Modern Infrastructure
The Company is implementing a multi-year effort to upgrade its infrastructure to provide a superior customer experience. The Retirement and Life administration systems have been enhanced for faster, more accurate processes; a substantial reduction in the amount of time it takes to issue Life policies; and improved ease of doing business for both customers and agents. The Property and Casualty administration system upgrade has completed its first phase, reducing claims cycle time and providing more insight into customer and loss trends. In addition, the Company has implemented several initiatives to successfully improve the Company Net Promoter Score (NPS), a leading measure of customer satisfaction. 
Through the acquisition of BCG, Horace Mann strengthens its retirement platform to better meet the needs of employers, as well as other worksite capabilities. This will strengthen Horace Mann's value proposition and enhance its retirement plan infrastructure and offerings for school districts.
Reporting Segments
Horace Mann conducts business primarily in four reporting segments: Property and Casualty, Retirement, Life and Corporate and Other.
These Segments are defined based on the way management organizes the segments for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Management maintains discrete financial information by these segments to evaluate performance and allocate resources.
The calculations of segment data are described in more detail in Item 8, Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Some of the information is discussed in this section, where the business operations of each segment are explained. The financial performance of each segment is discussed in Item 7 of this report.
Property and Casualty
The Company's primary Property and Casualty insurance products include private passenger automobile insurance and residential home insurance. The Company's automobile business is primarily preferred risk, defined as a household whose drivers have had no recent accidents and no more than one recent moving violation.

Property and other liability | 17.1% | 31.0% | 212,927 
Total | 55.2% | 100.0% | 675,705 

The Company offers standard auto coverages, including liability, collision and comprehensive. Horace Mann customers are mostly preferred risks, while the Company utilizes partner carriers for non-standard auto coverages. Property coverage includes both homeowners and renters policies. For both auto and property coverage, the Company offers educators a discounted rate and the Educator Advantage® package of features. This includes value-added benefits specifically for educators, such as liability coverage for transporting students in an insured vehicle and reimbursement for stolen school fundraising items.
The Company has programs in a majority of states to provide higher-risk automobile and property coverages, as well as a number of other insurance coverages, with third-party vendors underwriting and bearing the risk of such insurance and the Company receiving commissions on the sales. Similarly, the Company has increased its offering of third-party vendor products in many areas to include coverage for small business owners and classic/collector automobiles to meet those aspects of an educator's needs.

Property and Casualty Reserves

Property and Casualty unpaid claims and claim expenses (loss reserves) represent management's estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and settlement expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The Company calculates and records a single best estimate of the reserve as of each reporting date in conformity with generally accepted actuarial standards. For additional information regarding the process used to estimate Property and Casualty reserves and the risk factors involved, as well as a summary reconciliation of the beginning and ending Property and Casualty insurance claims and claim expense reserves and reserve development recorded in each of the three years ended December 31, 2018, see Item 8, Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates and Results of Operations for the Property and Casualty Segment for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2018 in this report.

All of the Company's reserves for Property and Casualty unpaid claims and claim expenses are carried at the full value of estimated liabilities and are not discounted for interest expected to be earned on reserves. Due to the nature of the Company's personal lines business, the Company has no exposure to losses related to claims for toxic waste cleanup, other environmental remediation or asbestos-related illnesses other than claims under property insurance policies for environmentally related items such as mold.

Property and Casualty Reinsurance

All reinsurance is obtained through contracts which generally are entered into for each calendar year. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge the Company from primary liability for the full amount of its policies, it does allow for recovery from assuming reinsurers to the extent of the reinsurance ceded. Past due reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2018 were not material.

The Company maintains catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance coverage. For 2018, the Company's catastrophe excess of loss coverage consisted of one contract in addition to a minimal amount of coverage by the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (FHCF). The catastrophe excess of loss contract provided 95% coverage for catastrophe losses above a retention of $25.0 million per occurrence up to $175.0 million per occurrence. This contract consisted of three layers, each of which provided for one mandatory reinstatement. The layers were $25.0 million excess of $25.0 million, $40.0 million excess of $50.0 million and $85.0 million excess of $90.0 million. The Company's 2019 catastrophe excess of loss coverage is unchanged from 2018.
The Company has not joined the California Earthquake Authority (CEA). The Company's exposure to losses from earthquakes is managed through its underwriting standards, its earthquake policy coverage limits and deductible levels, and the geographic distribution of its business, as well as its reinsurance program. After reviewing the exposure to earthquake losses from the Company's own policies and from what it would be with participation in the CEA, including estimated start-up and ongoing costs related to CEA participation, management believes it is in the Company's best economic interest to offer earthquake coverage directly to its property policyholders.

For liability coverages, in 2018 the Company reinsured each loss above a retention of $1.0 million up to $5.0 million per occurrence and $20.0 million in a clash event. A clash cover is a reinsurance casualty excess contract requiring two or more casualty coverages or policies issued by the Company to be involved in the same loss occurrence for coverage to apply. The Company's 2019 liability coverages are unchanged from 2018.
The Company markets personal lines excess liability policies. The limits of these policies are $1.0 million to $5.0 million in excess of $0.5 million of underlying auto and homeowners liability coverage. The Company reinsures these policies on a quota share basis with General Reinsurance Corporation (GRC). GRC assumes 95% of losses, including allocated loss adjustment expenses and premiums for all states except Massachusetts. For business written in the state of Massachusetts, the quota share portion is 75%. 
For auto insurance sold in Michigan, Personal Injury Protection (PIP) coverage is unlimited in compliance with Michigan state law. The Company participates in the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (MCCA). For policies issued in 2018, MCCA reimburses PIP losses including allocated loss adjustment expenses in excess of $0.6 million.
For property coverages, in 2018 the Company reinsured each loss above a retention of $1.0 million up to $5.0 million per risk, including catastrophe losses. Also, the Company could submit to the reinsurers two per risk losses from the same occurrence for a total of $8.0 million of property recovery in any one event. The Company's 2019 property coverages are unchanged from 2018.
The following table identifies the Company's most significant reinsurers under the catastrophe first event excess of loss reinsurance program, their percentage participation in this program and their ratings by A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best) and Standard & Poor's Global Inc. (S&P) as of January 1, 2019. No other single reinsurer's percentage participation in 2019 or 2018 exceeds 5%.

Retirement
Educators in the Company's target market continue to benefit from the provisions of Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). This section of the Code allows public school employees and employees of other tax-exempt organizations, such as not-for-profit private schools, to utilize pretax income to make periodic contributions to a qualified retirement plan (also see Regulation — Regulation at Federal Level). The Company entered the educators retirement annuity market in 1961 and is one of the largest participants in the K-12 educator portion of the 403(b) tax-qualified annuity market, measured by 403(b) net written premium on a statutory accounting basis. The Company has 403(b) payroll deduction capabilities utilized by approximately 30% of the 13,200 public school districts in the U.S. Of the Company's new annuity contract deposits in 2018, 57.2% were for 403(b) tax-qualified annuities and 61.9% of accumulated annuity value on deposit is 403(b) tax-qualified. In 2018, premium written* by Retirement represented 35.5% of the Company's consolidated insurance premiums written and contract deposits.

The Company markets both fixed and variable annuity contracts, primarily on a tax-qualified basis. Fixed only annuities provide a guarantee of principal and a guaranteed minimum rate of return. These contracts are backed by the Company's general account investments. The Company bears the investment risk associated with the investments and may change the declared interest rate on these contracts subject to contract guarantees. The Company also offers fixed indexed annuity (FIA) products with interest crediting strategies linked to the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). These products are fixed annuities with a guaranteed minimum interest rate, as described above, plus a contingent return based on equity market performance. The Company purchases call options on the applicable indices as an investment to provide the income needed to fund the annual index credits on the indexed products. See Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, for more information.

Variable annuities combine a fixed account option with equity-linked and bond-linked sub-account options. In general, contractholders bear the investment risk related to the variable annuity sub-accounts and may change their allocation at any time between the guaranteed interest rate fixed account and the wide range of variable investment options. By utilizing tools that provide assistance in determining needs and making asset allocation decisions, contractholders are able to choose the investment mix that matches their 
personal risk tolerance and retirement goals. The Company's sub-account options also include both lifecycle funds and asset allocation funds. These all-purpose funds have assets allocated among multiple investment classes within each fund based on a specific targeted retirement date or risk tolerance.

Variable annuity contracts with a guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB) provide an additional benefit if the contractholder dies and the contract value is less than a contractually defined amount. The Company has a relatively low exposure to GMDB risk as 30.0% of contract values have no guarantee; 64.6% have only a return of premium guarantee; and only 5.4% have a guarantee of premium roll-up at an annual rate of 3.0% or 5.0%.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 102 variable sub-account options including funds managed by some of the best known names in the mutual fund industry such as AllianceBernstein, American Funds, Ariel, BlackRock, Calvert, Davis, Dreyfus, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Lord Abbett, MFS, Neuberger Berman, Putnam, T. Rowe Price, Vanguard, Wells Fargo and Wilshire, offering the Company's customers multiple investment options to address their personal investment objectives and risk tolerance. These funds have been selected with the assistance of Wilshire Associates, the Company's fund advisor, until October 1, 2018 when they were replaced by SWBC Retirement Plan Services. The fund advisor provides oversight and input to fund manager additions and replacements. Total accumulated fixed and variable annuity cash value on deposit at December 31, 2018 was $6.7 billion.
In 2017, the Company introduced the Personal Retirement Planner (PRP) annuity series, replacing its previous individual annuity lineup. The PRP series includes a flexible premium deferred variable annuity, a flexible premium deferred fixed indexed annuity, a single premium deferred fixed annuity and a single premium immediate annuity. Consistent across all of these products is the elimination of any surrender charges for early withdrawal. This is supported by a revision in the compensation structure for the Company's Exclusive Distributors which pays them a consistent level percentage of account value each year in lieu of paying commissions up front on each deposit. The two fixed deferred annuity products each contain a market value adjustment clause to help mitigate disintermediation risk. The variable annuity offers a wide array of variable sub-accounts that are devoid of any revenue sharing or 12b-1 fees to provide greater fee transparency. The single premium deferred fixed annuity allows the customer to lock-in a fixed interest rate for a single lump sum payment for a period of 5, 7 or 10 years. FIA provides an opportunity for potentially greater credited interest over the long term than traditional fixed rate annuities by linking the credited interest rates to changes in a market index. In late 2018, the Company reintroduced two traditional fixed rate annuities and the original FIA from the previous annuity portfolio. This was done to expand the choices available to the Company's customers, particularly for customers who prefer the certainty of a declining surrender charge versus the unknown potential impact of a market value adjustment. These products also offer up-front premium bonuses which were eliminated in the 2017 product portfolio.
In addition to variable annuities, the Company administers the Horace Mann Retirement Advantage® open architecture platform for 403(b)(7) and other defined contribution plans. This platform combines a wide array of mutual funds integrated with a group unallocated fixed annuity stable value fund. This platform provides the Company with greater flexibility to offer customized 403(b)(7) and other qualified plan solutions to better meet the needs of school districts and other non-for-profit plan sponsors. With the acquisition of BCG, the Company expects to migrate the administration of its Retirement Advantage® platform from a third-party vendor to the BCG platform and it expects to offer its Group Unallocated Fixed Annuity as a stable value option within a number of the 401(k) plans BCG administers.
To further assist registered representatives in delivering the Horace Mann Value Proposition, the Company has entered into third-party vendor agreements with American Funds Distributors, Inc. and Fidelity Distributors Corporation, to market their respective 529 college savings programs, and a brokerage clearing arrangement with Raymond James Financial, Inc. In addition, the Company's Investment Advisor Representatives offer investment portfolios managed by unaffiliated registered investment advisors. With the recent expansion of the Company’s annuity lineup and introduction of the Retirement Advantage® platform, the Company has significantly reduced its utilization of third-party vendor products to help fill the life and retirement needs not met by products manufactured by the Company. But that capability of selling third-party manufactured products and receiving a fee on such sales remains in place where opportunity arises.
Life
The Company entered the individual life insurance business in 1949. The Company offers traditional term and whole life insurance products and, from time to time, revises products and product features or develops new products. Additionally, the Company offers a discount for educator customers.

During 2018, the average face amount of ordinary life insurance policies issued by the Company was approximately $186,000 and the average face amount of all ordinary life insurance policies in force at December 31, 2018 was approximately $108,000.
The Company offers a lineup of several product portfolios. Life by Design is a portfolio of Horace Mann manufactured and branded life insurance products which specifically address the financial planning needs of educators. The Life by Design portfolio features individual whole life and individual term products, including 10, 20 and 30-year level term policies. The Life by Design policies have premiums that are guaranteed for the duration of the contract and offer lower minimum face amounts.
The Company offers a combination product called Life Select that mixes a base of either traditional whole life, 20-pay life or life paid-up at age 65 with a variety of term riders to allow for more flexibility in tailoring the coverage to customers' varying life insurance needs. Additional products and features include single premium whole life products, as well as a preferred plus underwriting category and $0.5 million and $1.0 million rate band enhancements for term products. The Company offers Cash Value Term — a term policy that builds cash value while providing the income protection of traditional level term life insurance.

The Company offers an indexed universal life (IUL) product with interest crediting strategies linked to the S&P 500 Index and the DJIA offering a contingent return based on equity market performance. Along with expanded product offerings, new marketing support tools continue to be introduced to aid the agency force. After December 31, 2006, the Company no longer issues new policies for its Experience Life product, a flexible, adjustable-premium life insurance contract that includes availability of an interest-bearing account.
Life Reinsurance
The maximum individual life insurance risk retained by the Company is $300,000 on any individual life, while either $100,000 or $125,000 is retained on each group life policy depending on the type of coverage. The excess of the amounts retained are reinsured with life reinsurers that are rated A (Excellent) or above by A.M. Best. The Company also maintains a life catastrophe reinsurance program. In 2018, the Company reinsured 100% of the catastrophe risk in excess of $1.0 million up to $35.0 million per occurrence, with one reinstatement. For 2019, the Company's catastrophe risk coverage is unchanged. The Company's life catastrophe risk reinsurance program covers acts of terrorism and includes nuclear, biological and chemical explosions but excludes other acts of war.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other includes capital raising activities (including debt financing and related interest expense), net investment gains (losses), certain public company expenses and other corporate-level transactions (including expenses related to business acquisition activity). The Company does not allocate the impact of corporate-level transactions to the operating segments, consistent with the basis for management's evaluation of the results of those segments.
Geographic Composition of Business

The Company's business is geographically diversified. For the year ended December 31, 2018, based on direct premiums and contract deposits for all product lines, the top five states and their portion of total direct insurance premiums and contract deposits were California, 8.3%; Texas, 7.3%; North Carolina, 6.5%; Minnesota, 5.8%; and South Carolina, 5.7%.

Competition
The Company operates in a highly competitive environment. The insurance industry consists of a large number of insurance companies, some of which have substantially greater financial resources, widespread advertising campaigns, more diversified product lines, greater economies of scale and/or lower-cost marketing approaches compared to the Company. In the Company's target market, management believes that the principal competitive factors in the sale of Property and Casualty's insurance products are overall service, worksite sales and service, price, and name recognition. Management believes that the principal competitive factors in the sale of Retirement's products and Life's insurance products are worksite sales and service, product features, perceived stability of the insurer, price, overall service and name recognition.

The Company competes in its target market with a number of national providers of personal automobile, property and life insurance such as State Farm, Allstate, Farmers, Liberty Mutual and Nationwide as well as several regional companies. The Company also competes for automobile business with other companies such as GEICO, Progressive and USAA, many of which feature direct marketing distribution.
Among the national providers of annuities and other financial service platforms that serve the retirement needs of educators and others that serve the community, the Company's major competitors include The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of American International Group; AXA; Voya Financial, Inc.; Life Insurance Company of the Southwest, a subsidiary of National Life Insurance Company; Security Benefit; and Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association – College Retirement Equities Fund. Select mutual fund families and financial planners also compete in this marketplace.

The market for tax-deferred retirement products in the Company's target market has been impacted by the revised Code Section 403(b) regulations, which made the 403(b) market more comparable to the 401(k) market than it was in the past. While this change has and may continue to reduce the number of competitors in this market, it has made the 403(b) market more attractive to some of the larger companies experienced in 401(k) plans, including both insurance and mutual fund companies, that had not previously been active competitors in this business.
Investments

The Company's investments are selected to balance the objectives of protecting principal, minimizing exposure to interest rate risk and providing a high current yield. These objectives are implemented through a portfolio that emphasizes investment grade, publicly traded fixed maturity securities, which are selected to match the anticipated duration of the Company's liabilities. When impairment of the value of an investment is considered other-than-temporary, the decrease in value is recognized and a new cost basis is established.
The Company has separate investment strategies and guidelines for its Property and Casualty, Retirement and Life portfolios, which recognize different characteristics of the associated insurance liabilities, as well as different tax and regulatory environments. The Company manages interest rate exposure for its portfolios through asset/liability management techniques which attempt to coordinate the duration of the assets with the duration of the insurance policy liabilities. Duration of assets and liabilities will generally differ only because of opportunities to significantly increase yields or because policy values are not interest rate sensitive, as is the case in Property and Casualty.

The investments of each insurance subsidiary must comply with the insurance laws of such insurance subsidiary's domiciliary state. These laws prescribe the type and amount of investments that may be purchased and held by insurance companies. In general, these laws permit investments, within specified limits and subject to certain qualifications, in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, preferred stocks, common stocks, real estate mortgages, real estate, and alternative investments.

Fixed Maturity Securities

For reporting purposes, the Company has classified the entire portfolio of fixed maturity securities as "available for sale". Fixed maturity securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value. The adjustment for net unrealized investment gains (losses) on securities available for sale is recognized as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity, net of applicable deferred taxes and the related impact on deferred policy acquisition costs associated with investment contracts and life insurance products with account values. Fixed maturity securities held for indefinite periods of time include securities that management intends to use as part of its asset/liability management strategy and that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, resultant prepayment risk and other related factors, other than securities that are in an unrealized loss position for which management has the stated intent to hold until recovery.

Mortgage-backed securities typically have average lives shorter than their stated maturities due to unscheduled prepayments on the underlying mortgages. Mortgages are prepaid for a variety of reasons, including sales of existing homes, interest rate changes over time that encourage homeowners to refinance their mortgages and defaults by homeowners on mortgages that are then paid by guarantors.
Cash Flow

Information regarding HMEC's sources and uses of cash, including payment of principal and interest with respect to HMEC's indebtedness, and payment by HMEC of dividends to its shareholders, is contained Item 8, Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 7, Liquidity and Financial Resources — Cash Flow and — Capital Resources in this report.

The ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to HMEC is subject to state insurance department regulations which generally permit dividends to be paid for any 12 month period in amounts equal to the greater of (i) net income for the preceding calendar year or (ii) 10% of surplus, determined in conformity with statutory accounting principles, as of the preceding December 31st. Any dividend in excess of these levels requires the prior approval of the Director or Commissioner of the state insurance department of the state in which the dividend paying insurance subsidiary is domiciled. The aggregate amount of dividends that may be paid to HMEC in 2019 from all its insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval is $90.7 million.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if insurance regulators otherwise determine that payment of a dividend or any other payment to an affiliate would be detrimental to an insurance subsidiary's policyholders or creditors, because of the financial condition of the insurance subsidiary or otherwise, the regulators may block dividends or other payments to affiliates that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval.
Regulation

General Regulation at State Level

As an insurance holding company, HMEC is subject to extensive regulation by the states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or transact business. Some regulations, such as those addressing unclaimed property, generally apply to all corporations. In addition, the laws of the various states establish regulatory agencies with broad administrative powers, which relate to a wide variety of matters, including granting and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices and rate setting, licensing agents, requiring statutory financial statements, monitoring insurer solvency and reserve adequacy, and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted. On an ongoing basis, various state legislators and insurance regulators examine the nature and scope of state insurance regulation.

In addition to individual state monitoring and regulation, state regulators develop coordinated regulatory policies through the NAIC. States have adopted NAIC risk-based capital guidelines to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to an insurance company's risks. Based on current guidelines, the risk-based capital statutory requirements are not expected to have a negative regulatory impact on HMEC's insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, statutory capital and surplus of each of HMEC's insurance subsidiaries was above required levels. States have also adopted the NAIC's U.S. Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) which requires insurance companies to submit their own assessment of their current and future risks and provide a consolidated group-level perspective on risk and capital formulated through an internal risk self-assessment process.

Assessments Against Insurers and Mandatory Insurance Facilities

Under insurance insolvency or guaranty laws in most states in which the Company operates, insurers doing business therein can be assessed for policyholder losses related to insolvencies of other insurance companies, and many assessments paid by the Company pursuant to these laws may be used as credits for a portion of the Company's premium taxes in certain states. Also, the Company is required to participate in various mandatory insurance facilities in proportion to the amount of the Company's direct writings in the applicable state. For the three years ended December 31, 2018, the impacts of the above industry items were not material to the Company's results of operations.
Regulation at Federal Level

Although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal initiatives often impact the insurance business. Current and proposed federal measures which may significantly affect insurance and retirement business include employee benefits regulation, standards applied to employer sponsored retirement plans, standards applied to certain financial advisors, controls on the costs of medical care, medical entitlement programs such as Medicare, structure of retirement plans and accounts, changes to the insurance industry antitrust exemption, and minimum solvency requirements. Also, see Item 1A of this report. Other federal regulation such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and USA PATRIOT Act, including its anti-money laundering regulations, also impact the Company's business. 
The variable annuities underwritten by HMLIC are regulated by the SEC. Horace Mann Investors, Inc., the broker-dealer and Registered Investment Adviser subsidiary of HMEC, is also regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), the Municipal Securities Rule-making Board (MSRB) and various state securities regulators.

Federal income taxation of the build-up of cash value within a life insurance policy or an annuity contract could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's ability to market and sell such products. Various legislation to this effect has been proposed in the past, but has not been enacted. Although no such legislative proposals are known to exist at this time, such proposals may be made again in the future. Changes in other federal and state laws and regulations could also affect the relative tax and other advantages of the Company's annuity and life products.

Financial Regulation Legislation

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) created the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The FIO studies the current insurance regulatory system and is charged with monitoring and providing specific reports on various aspects of the insurance industry. However, the FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance. The FIO has suggested an expanded federal role in some circumstances. The executive branch has requested a review of financial regulation, including Dodd-Frank. Management will continue to monitor these future developments for impact on the Company, insurers of similar size and the insurance industry as a whole.
Employees

At December 31, 2018, the Company had 1,478 non-agent employees and 17 full-time Employee Agents. (This does not include Exclusive Distributors that were part of the Company's total dedicated agency force at December 31, 2018.) The Company has no collective bargaining agreement with any employees.
