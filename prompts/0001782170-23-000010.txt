Item 1. Business
Overview
Remitly was founded in 2011 to transform the lives of immigrants and their families by providing the most trusted financial services on the planet. 
The inspiration behind Remitly came when Matt, our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, was living and working in Kenya. Today, Remitly is a leading digital financial services provider for immigrants and their families in over 170 countries around the world. The long-term, trusted relationships we foster with our customers have enabled us to expand our core cross-border remittance product to over 4,300 corridors worldwide and we are now working to offer complementary new products to our now 4.2 million quarterly active users. 
Our customers are at the heart of everything we do. They are primarily immigrants from developing countries who have moved away from their families to seek new opportunities and build a better life for themselves and their loved ones. While our customers may be physically distant, they remain closely connected with and deeply committed to their family and friends back home – often sending money home multiple times per month. 
Remitly’s culture is key to our success.
Our cultural values act as a blueprint for how we get things done. In 2022, we refreshed our values as we do regularly to align with our strategy. The one constant, and single most important of these values is customer centricity, which serves as our north star in all that we do. To us, customer centricity means “we are here to listen to, learn from, and serve our customers.” 
Our other core values fall broadly into three categories:
•Our purpose: Aim for the stars, be an owner, earn trust through integrity, and be joyful;
•Building relationships: Lead authentically, be global, hire and grow exceptional people, be constructively direct, and be a compassionate partner; and
•Taking action: Have a bias for action, be data-driven, sweat the details, deliver on promises, overcome fear, and continuously improve.
These values influence our actions every day. Living up to our values builds customer trust, inspires employee engagement, and makes “Promises Delivered” our fundamental ethos.
Acquisition of Rewire
On January 5, 2023, we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Rewire (O.S.G) Research and Development Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the State of Israel (“Rewire”), for approximately $77.0 million of aggregate consideration, the majority of which was or will be settled in cash, with the remaining consideration settled in Remitly equity. The acquisition of Rewire allows us to accelerate our opportunity to differentiate the remittance experience with complementary products, by bringing together our remittance businesses in new geographies, along with a strong team that is culturally aligned with Remitly.
2022 Key Performance Metrics
The vast majority of our revenue today is generated through our remittance business, where we earn revenue from transaction fees charged to customers who are sending remittances and the foreign exchange spreads earned between the foreign exchange rate offered to customers and the foreign exchange rate on the Company’s currency purchases. In addition to our financial results, we regularly review key business metrics to evaluate our performance. These key business metrics include active customers and send volume. 
Our 2022 key performance metrics included the following results: 
•Active customers for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased to 4.2 million, from 2.8 million, up 48% year over year.
•Send volume for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased to over $28.6 billion, from $20.4 billion, up 40% year over year.
We regularly review these key business metrics to evaluate our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these key business metrics provide meaningful supplemental information for management and investors in assessing our historical and future operating performance. The calculation of these key business metrics discussed below may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, analysts, or investors.
Table of Contents

The key business metrics that we use to measure the performance of our business are defined as follows:
•“Active customers” is defined as the number of distinct customers that have successfully completed at least one transaction using Remitly during a given calendar quarter. We identify customers through unique account numbers. 
•“Send volume” is defined as the sum of the amount that customers send, measured in U.S. dollars, related to transactions completed during a given period. This amount is net of cancellations, does not include transaction fees from customers, and does not include any credits, offers, or bonuses applied to the transaction by us.
As active customers are measured on a quarterly basis, the data for the full-year periods for active customers is not meaningful, and therefore this metric is only presented on a quarterly basis herein.
Our Services 
We provide a digital cross-border remittance product that is accessible via our mobile app or the web. Our customers are able to set up an account and start sending money to international recipients on our platform, generally within minutes. Recipients can receive funds in multiple ways using our diversified and global disbursement network. Our customers and their families can also track the status of their transactions in real time. Today, our customers predominately engage with us via their mobile phones, either using our app or website, shifting what traditionally required waiting in line to speak with an agent to the palm of their hands. Providing our customers with a convenient, easy, and safe mobile experience underpins our approach to product development, marketing, and customer success. 
Our remittance revenue is earned from transaction fees charged to customers who are sending remittances and the foreign exchange spreads between the foreign exchange rate offered to customers and the foreign exchange rate on the Company’s currency purchases. 
While our journey began in digital cross-border remittances, we continue to evolve and develop a portfolio of broader complementary financial services including the design and build of a mobile-centric suite of products to address our customers’ discrete financial services needs, many of which are not met by legacy institutions. We expect to expand this opportunity through our recent acquisition of Rewire, along with our continued investment in complementary new products.
Substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from digital cross-border remittances.
Technology 
Our Technology Platform
Our purpose-built technology platform powers localized consumer experiences, enables a robust network of partner integrations, and uses data to optimize business performance, while enabling our ability to expand into complementary products.
Given the scale of our business and the complexity of digital cross-border payments, our technology platform has broad and complex capabilities and, together with our data, gives us a unique advantage in understanding our customers. Our technology platform is comprised of the following:
•Core transaction engine that underpins the entire transaction lifecycle from pricing and foreign currency, to funding, processing, and, ultimately, to disbursement;
•Customer experience engine with corridor-specific user journeys and multilingual self-service or real-time support; 
•Disbursement network for partner integrations that supports a diverse set of delivery methods for our customers and their recipients in over 170 countries; 
•Marketing technology stack that enables our marketing team to efficiently operate and improve the quality of our customer experiences by supporting our localization strategies and efficiently capturing and analyzing data to ensure maximum long-term return on our marketing investments; and
•Our electronic KYC, machine learning-based fraud scoring and payment authentication processes that all take place in real-time to give our customers immediate feedback and are in compliance with highly complex and continuously evolving global and local regulations.
Customer Experience
We strive to make each customer interaction on our digital products intuitive and friction-free. New customers can initiate a transaction in just minutes after setting up an account and adding their recipient’s information. We invest substantial time, energy, and resources to ensure we have a deep understanding of our customers’ needs, and we continually innovate to deliver value-added features, products and services. We therefore have significant resources dedicated to technology and development across multiple teams including product, engineering, design, analytics, compliance, marketing, and customer service. These teams are responsible for the envisioning, design, development, and testing of our platform and services. We focus the majority of our investment on developing new functionality, making it accessible and relevant globally, and further enhancing the usability, reliability, and performance of our platform and services.

Our Global Network 
Our global network of funding and disbursement partners is at the core of our business. Over the last decade, we have strategically expanded our network in existing corridors to provide our customers with increasing disbursement options and in new corridors as part of our expansion strategy. A key focus of our global network strategy is continuing to expand the number of direct integrations with local partners. These direct integrations allow for a better customer experience and lower costs and are a significant competitive advantage. Our partners, including those that are among the most trusted and recognized brands around the world, create a broad and effective payment acceptance (pay-in) and payment delivery (pay-out) ecosystem for our customers:
•Payment acceptance. We have relationships with top tier banks including Barclays, Chase, HSBC, and Wells Fargo, and leading global payment processors including a direct relationship with Visa. These relationships provide our customers an array of payment (or pay-in) options to fund remittances with a bank account, card-based payment, or alternative payment method.
We can accept and settle transfers from hundreds of millions of consumer bank accounts as well as Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards in the 32 send countries and territories we operate in today. As a digital service, we do not have sending agents who accept cash. We, in turn, do not incur costs or commissions associated with physical agent-based sending and funding. 
•Payment delivery. We have access to many disbursement partners across the globe including major banks, cash pick-up, and mobile wallet partners. These relationships provide our customers with choice of delivery and enable us to send funds within minutes, or even seconds, to approximately 4.0 billion bank accounts, approximately 1.1 billion mobile wallets and alternative payment methods, and over 435,000 cash pickup locations (including retail outlets and banks).
We select our disbursement partners based on our recipients’ preferences, quality of service, brand recognition, and co-branding opportunities. Our disbursement partners make us a trusted source of remittances because our customers are typically already familiar with their chosen disbursement partner and recipients feel comfortable receiving money where they regularly bank or shop. In addition, we only select disbursement partners that meet or exceed: (1) our geographic coverage goals in the markets in which they operate, (2) our robust compliance and regulatory requirements, and (3) our specific operating metrics such as credit worthiness and error rates.
Certain of our funding and disbursement partnerships are multi-faceted. For example, a bank can be a payment processor who helps Remitly facilitate payment acceptance, a settlement bank where Remitly deposits customer funds for payment delivery, or a corporate bank providing certain services such as treasury and cash management. In addition, we have redundancies built into our global network for our various partnerships.
Today, our customers primarily send money from the United States, Canada, and other countries in Europe. Our customers and their recipients are located in over 170 countries around the world; our largest receive countries include India, Mexico, and the Philippines.
What Sets Us Apart
Our Core Pillars 
Our brand promise is to bring “peace of mind” into everything we do. We focus on bringing trust, reliability, and a fair and transparent price to cross-border remittances and complementary financial services.
To deliver on our brand promise, we have a differentiated approach that aligns with the specific needs and interests of our customers and solves the problems immigrant communities often face in making remittances. There are four core elements to our differentiated approach:
•Providing a Simple and Reliable Way of Sending Money with Our Mobile-Centric Suite of Products. As of December 31, 2022, our mobile app had a 4.9 iOS App Store rating with more than 1 million reviewers and a 4.8 Android Google Play rating with more than 580,000 reviewers. We have achieved this level of engagement and these high ratings by designing mobile-centric products that make the customer experience simple and convenient and give our customers complete peace of mind. 
Our mobile app for cross-border remittances provides an easy-to-use, end-to-end process. In just a few minutes, customers are able to set up and send money for the first time with Remitly, and repeat transactions become easier with just three taps. Our customers and their families can also track the status of their transactions in real time. This mobile-centric experience enables us to engage beyond the initial transaction, generating strong repeat usage and high customer loyalty. 
•Conveniently Putting Money Safely in the Hands of Our Customers’ Families, Wherever They Are, by Relying on Our Global Network. Our global network of funding and disbursement partnerships enables us to complete money transfers in over 4,300 corridors without the need to deploy local operations in each country. We are able to do this while complying with global and local licensing and regulatory requirements. A corridor represents the pairing of a send country, from which a customer can send a remittance, with a specific receive country to which such remittance can be sent. As a result of the quality of our network and the foundational investments we have made, in general every new send country we add results in a significant number of new corridors, as we are able to quickly connect send countries with receive countries, allowing us to continue to scale rapidly.

Our disbursement options within our global network continue to grow and remain an important driver of customer loyalty. We have partner relationships with global banks and leading payment providers to give our customers an array of payment (or pay-in) options, including with a bank account, card-based payments and alternative payment methods. Our disbursement network provides our customers with various digital and traditional delivery methods and enables us to send (or pay-out) funds to approximately 4.0 billion bank accounts, approximately 1.1 billion mobile wallets, and over 435,000 cash pickup locations. We focus on creating financial inclusion by providing payout optionality and access for recipients who don’t always have convenient access to traditional banking. We believe our focus on financial inclusion creates peace of mind for our customers and their families while attracting and retaining loyal customers. We continue to believe the quality of our network and our focus on customer preference in disbursement options remains a competitive differentiator.
•Creating Trusted and Personalized Experiences with Our Localization Expertise at Scale. We believe our expertise in localizing our marketing, products, and customer support at scale is a key differentiator and enables us to provide customers with a personalized experience that drives peace of mind. Localization can mean many things. To us, it means speaking with our customers in their preferred language, reaching them through the media channels they frequent, and being culturally relevant through their journey. While our business is global, we recognize the importance of a culturally relevant experience being delivered to our customers and their families in the many countries we serve. We strive to deliver marketing, product, and support experiences that connect with them in meaningful ways. For example, we tailor our customer experience with 15 native languages, and we provide peace of mind with our global customer support team. Additionally, for disbursement of funds, we partner with local brands that are among the most trusted and recognized by our customers and their families.
•Using Our Data-Driven Approach to Better Serve Our Customers and Provide More Value. We have a data-driven approach to how we grow our business, prioritize our investments, and manage our operations. Because our customers initiate transfers digitally, we capture and leverage a body of transaction-related data that provides insight into customer behavior and customer experience. This data and the analytics we perform inform our marketing investments and product development prioritization. In addition, we leverage our data platform and proprietary models to improve our compliance systems and manage pricing, treasury, fraud risk, and customer support. 
Strategy
We operate in a large and fragmented market. Based on estimates from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the market for global money transfers was estimated to include over $1.6 trillion in total migrant remittance volume in 2022 (including both formal and informal person-to-person channels), and has been growing at over a 5% compound annual growth rate over the past decade, with digital volumes significantly outpacing the rest of the market. In our core serviceable available market, remittance flows to developing countries were expected to reach approximately $626 billion in 2022, according to the World Bank in November 2022. To contextualize the size and importance of this market, according to the United Nations, global remittances are over two times larger than the amount of official development assistance. 
As of December 31, 2022, we captured approximately 2% of the total migrant remittance inflow volume. We believe that we can capture a larger share of this market. We also believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to significantly expand our total addressable market by leveraging our trusted brand to offer a broader set of financial services to the more than 280 million global immigrants and their families.
Our approach to achieving these goals has been rooted from Day 1 in customer centricity, which means deeply understanding our customers’ unique and local needs to provide them with a differentiated experience in remittances and complementary financial services. Strategically managing the business from this perspective has been key to our success since the very beginning and forms the frame for the remainder of our strategy, which includes the following focus areas:
•Increase our active customer base by focusing on efficient new customer acquisition. We plan on continuing our marketing efforts across existing and new corridors to increase brand awareness with customers and highlight the value of our products and services. We believe this will attract new customers to try Remitly. As we grow our customer base, we expect to benefit from increased operating leverage in the business and more data and insight to enhance our models. We have been able to drive efficiencies in new customer acquisition by focusing on elasticity testing, optimizing channel mix, and by increasing word of mouth and referrals driven by our increasing scale.
•Expand our geographic footprint. While our global network spans across over 4,300 corridors around the world, we have plans to increase our reach to thousands of additional corridors. We see an opportunity to generate value by expanding our remittance services more broadly in this way. We expect to leverage our data-driven approach to optimize our pricing, product features, marketing strategies, and customer economics as we expand and grow in these new geographies. Additionally, we expect to leverage our localization expertise and our technology platform to grow the number of disbursement, payment and other partners in our global network and increase the number of direct integrations with such partners. We will also continue to establish new disbursement partnerships and add new payment methods to enhance our cross-border payment remittance experience for current and potential customers in our existing corridors.

•Continue investing in remittance product enhancements and developing complementary new products to increase customer engagement and drive long-term repeat use. We believe there are enormous opportunities to create a more inclusive financial system that not only encompasses, but caters to the needs of immigrants. Specifically, we are using the insights we gain about immigrant customers through our data-driven platform to invest in remittance product enhancements and develop complementary new products. The majority of our customers use our products and services multiple times per month. To further strengthen our customer relationships and brand loyalty, we will continue to enhance our products and services and develop new features to tailor and personalize our customers’ experiences, as we continue to learn what our customers need, in order to optimize our pricing and delivery options. We believe our complementary new product strategy will deepen and expand our remittance relationship with our customers creating a unique and virtuous cycle that leads to increased customer value, long term customer engagement and a competitive advantage for Remitly that will be hard to replicate. 
While our main growth strategy has historically been organic, we may also selectively pursue strategic partnerships and acquisitions to accelerate our growth objectives or to enhance our competitive position within existing and new products and markets. For example, in August 2022 we announced our intent to acquire Rewire, as part of our strategy to accelerate our growth objectives. We completed the acquisition of Rewire in January 2023. 
Competition
We have experienced and expect to continue to experience competition from a number of companies, including those who are well-established and may have greater resources, and those who may become meaningful competitors in the future. Our diverse array of competitors generally falls into the following categories:
•Incumbent providers with a scaled legacy footprint. Traditional providers with large networks of brick-and-mortar locations and agents around the world that have been slow to adopt digital solutions. 
•Traditional banks. Traditional bank networks that offer a wide variety of financial services, including international remittances, but have limited disbursement options and may have burdensome KYC processes that do not cater to immigrant populations. 
•Digital-first cross-border payment providers. Digital-first providers of payments, money transfer and remittance products that aim to be convenient, transparent and affordable, with varying corridor-related focuses, such as developed-to-developing or developed-to-developed markets. 
•Emerging players focused on complementary financial services. Online-only banks, wallets, and other emerging digital players typically offer a subset of the financial services offered by traditional banks, and generally place a greater emphasis on convenience and user experience. Similarly, those utilizing blockchain technology and digital or crypto assets often claim benefits of lower cost transactions and higher transfer speeds relative to incumbent money-movement providers. However, price volatility, various fiat conversion fees, user friction, lack of trust and other factors have limited the utility of cryptocurrencies, as well as digital assets broadly, for remittances. Still, Remitly continues to assess blockchain technologies and digital assets as both an opportunity and competitive risk, particularly as the technology continues to evolve. 
•Informal person-to-person channels. Bringing cash home when immigrants travel, trusting others to deliver cash back home, established networks of “IOUs” based on documentation or passwords, and other systems of trust-based cash transfers that evade tracking and regulation.
Digital-first companies are increasingly gaining market share from legacy providers and traditional banks. We believe that the principal competitive factors across experience, product, network and technology include:
•Experience: Digital-first companies, like Remitly, are focusing on the customer experience, by providing a trusted relationship with customers and their families, especially during devastating times, which ranges from family emergencies to natural disasters. Digital first companies also provide a simple and convenient customer experience, which is specialized to customers by region, which appeals to customers and their families on a hyper-local level.
•Product: Digital-first companies have the ability to focus on the product. With the various pay-in and pay-out options, the speed and certainty of transactions is a competitive advantage. Additionally, these companies are able to provide an adjacent suite of digital-first financial services (complementary products) with fair and transparent product pricing, while providing global and local customer service.
•Network: Digital-first companies leverage their expansive global network, which allows the companies to provide a vast array of easy-to-access disbursement options and the ability to accept alternative payment methods.
•Technology: In a world of being digitally connected, digital-first companies focus on technological differentiation, through service availability, performance, scalability, and reliability. The ability to innovate continues to be a competitive advantage. Additionally, technology allows for efficient fraud, compliance, and regulatory management in the highly regulated industry. 
By focusing on the unique needs of immigrants and having a relentless customer focus, we believe that we have built a differentiated and compelling value proposition, and that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors.
Specifically, we believe that our mobile-centric suite of products, our vast global network, our localization expertise at scale, and our data-driven approach create sustainable differentiation against competitors.

Regulatory Environment
Our business is subject to a wide range of federal, state, and international laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance across the globe. The majority of these are applicable to us on the basis of the jurisdictions in which we operate and conduct our activities. These include, without limitation, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). We are also subject to laws, regulations and guidance on the basis of the jurisdictions in which recipients receive disbursements. These include, without limitation, India, Mexico, and the Philippines as well as other developing countries. These laws and regulations include strict requirements intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, data misuse, theft and misappropriation, and other illicit activity. In addition, the applicable regulatory framework includes laws, regulations, and guidance regarding money transmission licensing, financial services, consumer disclosure and protection, foreign exchange, currency controls, unclaimed property, privacy, and data security. The regulatory requirements applicable to our business in any given jurisdiction are typically extensive, complex, frequently changing, increasing in scope, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Legal and Compliance Risks.”
We have developed and implemented a compliance program, including our anti-money laundering (“AML”) program, comprised of policies and procedures designed to comply with such regulatory framework as it applies to our business. We also monitor these areas closely to continue to adapt our business practices and strategies to help us comply with current and evolving regulatory environment. 
Anti-Money Laundering. In the United States, our business is subject to federal AML laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, which include the Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as well as similar state laws, regulations and supervisory guidance. The BSA, among other things, requires companies engaged in money transmission register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury as money services businesses; and to develop and maintain risk-based AML programs, report suspicious activity, and collect and maintain information about their customers and certain transaction records. These requirements may also apply to our distribution partners and sub-partners. Furthermore, FinCEN has interpreted the BSA to require money services businesses to conduct risk-based monitoring of their agents, which may include distribution partners. 
Similar AML laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance in the countries where we operate and those where we are licensed apply to our business internationally. These include laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance to detect and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, including obligations to collect and maintain information about our users, recordkeeping, reporting and due diligence, and supervision of agents and sub-agents similar to, and in some cases exceeding, those required under the BSA. We are also, to a lesser extent, impacted by AML laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance in the other countries in which our disbursement partners operate.
As a money services business, we maintain a stringent AML compliance program that includes internal policies and controls, designation of AML compliance officers for each of our regulated subsidiaries, ongoing employee training and monitoring programs, and annual independent reviews. 
Sanctions. Our business must also comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and with similar sanctions administered by sanctions authorities in other jurisdictions in which we operate or where we are licensed. These laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance prohibit or restrict transactions in, to or from certain countries, regions or governments, as well as with certain individuals and entities such as traffickers in illegal goods or services, terrorists and terrorist organizations. Sanctions are imposed to address acute foreign policy and national security threats, and may change rapidly and unpredictably in response to world events or domestic or international political developments. 
We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these economic and trade sanctions programs. These measures include, without limitation, controls designed to prevent transactions to or from countries or territories that are subject to comprehensive sanctions, screening certain transactions and customer information against OFAC and other international government watch-lists, blocking funds of persons named on OFAC’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons and other persons and entities designated as prohibited persons by U.S. and non-U.S. sanctions authorities, and preparing and submitting blocking and other reports as required by relevant authorities. 
Anti-Bribery. We are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) in the United States, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act in Canada (“CFPOA”), the U.K. Bribery Act in the United Kingdom and similar laws in the other jurisdictions in which we or our disbursement partners operate, which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of influencing official action or otherwise gaining an unfair business advantage, such as obtaining or retaining business. We maintain a compliance program designed to ensure our compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance.
Money Transmission and Stored Value Licensing or Registration. We are subject to licensing and registration requirements in relation to our money transmission and stored value issuance activities on a state by state and federal basis in the United States and in almost every other jurisdiction from which our customers initiate transactions, including, but not limited to, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the EEA.
Table of Contents

In the United States, we are registered as a Money Services Business with FinCEN and we hold licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in 48 states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia. As a licensed money transmitter, we are subject to, among other requirements, restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, minimum net worth requirements, customer disclosure requirements, regulatory approval of directors and senior management of the licensed entity, AML and sanctions compliance, cybersecurity program requirements, and examination by state regulatory agencies. In connection with certain licenses we hold in the United States, there are also different shareholding thresholds (as low as 10% or more of the total equity in the United States) that may require a shareholder to obtain regulatory approval prior to exceeding such thresholds.
Outside the United States, we provide services to our customers in a variety of ways. In several key jurisdictions, we have obtained licenses to operate as a money services business or payment institution, as applicable. In Canada, we are registered with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada as a money services business. In the United Kingdom, we have obtained a payment institution license from the Financial Conduct Authority and are also registered as a Money Service Business. In Ireland, we have obtained a payment institution license from the Central Bank of Ireland, and such license is recognized across the EEA. In Singapore, we are licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as a major payment institution. In Australia, we are registered as a remittance service provider. We also hold licenses in several other jurisdictions and plan to apply for money transmitter licenses or their equivalents in additional jurisdictions. Additionally, in several foreign jurisdictions, we work with disbursement partners to make funds available to recipients. These may be locally licensed businesses or regulated banks whom we believe to be compliant with local laws.
Under these licensing regimes and associated regulations and supervision, we are subject to requirements such as capital and safeguarding rules, certain consumer protection requirements, IT, and operational security risk management requirements, outsourcing oversight requirements, and periodic regulatory examinations. In certain countries, we are able to serve our customers through the use of disbursement partners instead of obtaining our own license. These entities are typically locally licensed businesses or regulated banks whom we believe are compliant with local laws.
Unclaimed Property. We must also comply with unclaimed property laws in the United States and in other countries where we are licensed. These laws require us to remit to certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time, such as unpaid money transfers. We hold property subject to unclaimed property laws and we have an ongoing program designed to help us comply with these laws. We are subject to audits with regard to our escheatment practices. 
Consumer Disclosure and Consumer Protection. We are subject to laws, regulations and disclosure requirements relating to consumer protection in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations, where such laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance are enforced by numerous government agencies. In the U.S., the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) implements, examines compliance with, and enforces federal consumer protection laws governing financial products and services, including the Remittance Transfer Rule. The Remittance Transfer Rule requirements include (1) a disclosure requirement to provide consumers sending funds internationally from the United States enhanced pre-transaction written disclosures and receipts; (2) an obligation to investigate and resolve certain errors, including errors that may be outside our control; and (3) an obligation to cancel certain transactions upon that have not been completed at a customer’s request. The CFPB has recently signaled greater scrutiny regarding consumer fees and disclosures generally, and stronger enforcement of the Remittance Transfer Rule specifically. We expect a heightened enforcement environment for remittance companies, especially regarding transparency of fees and exchange rates. Furthermore, the CFPB may be considering new restrictions or rules on such fees and disclosures.
In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, it is unlawful for any provider of consumer financial products or services to engage in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practice (“UDAAP violations”). The CFPB has substantial rule-making and enforcement authority to prevent UDAAP violations in connection with any transaction involving a consumer financial product or service. As a larger participant in the market for international money transfers, we are subject to direct CFPB supervisory authority over our business. This includes the authority to fine and provide consumer restitution for violations, track and respond to consumer complaints, and request data. 
Indirect Regulatory Requirements. In addition to the direct licenses discussed above, we also seek, obtain and maintain additional licenses to support new products and use cases and we also are subject to indirect regulatory requirements based on the requirements of our product partners. At the current time, none of the businesses supported by these indirect or new licenses are material to our business.
Intellectual Property 
Intellectual property and proprietary rights (“IP Rights”) are important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual protections, to establish, maintain and protect our IP Rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how, and brand. 
As of December 31, 2022, we owned six U.S. registered trademarks, one pending U.S. trademark application, 88 foreign registered trademarks and 40 pending foreign trademark applications covering the mark REMITLY, our collapsed Clasped Hand logo, REMITLY (+ Clasped Hand Logo), PASSBOOK BY REMITLY, and Hui Mei Yi (Remitly in Chinese characters). We are pursuing additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Additionally, we own common law trademark rights in the above-referenced marks as well as the REMITLY PROMISES DELIVERED (+ Clasped Hand Logo) and PASSBOOK BY REMITLY (+ Clasped Hand Logo) mark in the United States and certain other jurisdictions where common law rights are recognized. We also own several domain names, including www.remitly.com.
Table of Contents

We monitor our trademarks and service marks through watch services which notify us when applications for potentially conflicting marks have been filed in the United States and in other jurisdictions. We also enforce our trademarks, service marks, trade names and domain names against infringing third-party trademarks, trade names and domain names by sending cease and desist letters, filing complaints, and commencing administrative, and other legal proceedings in the United States and various other jurisdictions. 
In addition, we rely upon a substantial amount of intellectual property licensed from third parties, including under certain open source licenses.
We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our IP Rights through contractual protections and appropriate technological restrictions, such as physical and electronic security measures. It is also our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements (or similar agreements) with our employees, consultants, and contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service.
See the section titled “Risk Factors—Privacy, Data Security, Intellectual Property, and Technology Risks” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our IP Rights.

We collect, use, receive, store, transmit, disclose, and otherwise process a wide variety of data and information (including personal information and sensitive personal information) for various purposes in our business. This aspect of our business is subject to numerous laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and other obligations in the United States and globally. Regulation and proposed regulation in this area has increased significantly in recent years and is expected to continue to do so. Our data handling is also subject to contractual obligations.
In the United States, various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations apply to the collection, disclosure, security and other processing of personal information, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLBA”), and various state laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security. The GLBA (along with its implementing regulations), a federal privacy law that applies to financial institutions, like Remitly, restricts certain collection, storage, use, disclosure and other processing of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information, requires notice to individuals of privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of such information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of such information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. 
In addition to numerous privacy and data security laws and regulations already in place, U.S. states are increasingly adopting laws imposing comprehensive privacy and data security obligations, which may be more stringent, broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information (including sensitive personal information) than foreign, federal, or other state laws and regulations, and such laws and regulations may differ from or conflict with each other. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively, the “CCPA”), broadly defines personal information, gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. Other states have enacted, or are considering enacting, comprehensive privacy and data security laws that share similarities with the CCPA, with at least four such laws (in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah) having taken effect, or scheduled to take effect, in 2023. There are also ongoing discussions in the U.S. Congress of a new federal privacy and data security law to which we may become subject if it is enacted. Additionally, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, security and other processing of personal information.
Internationally, many countries have established their own privacy and data security legal framework with which we, our customers and/or partners may need to comply. For example, as a result of our presence in Europe and our service offering in the European Union, we are subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which imposes stringent privacy and data security requirements. The GDPR includes numerous requirements and changes from previously existing European law, including more robust obligations on data controllers and processors and more fulsome documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs by covered companies. Failure to comply with the GDPR can result in fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues of the violator. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA, including the United States, in respect of which the European Commission or other relevant regulatory body has not issued a so called ‘adequacy decision,’ unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal data. We rely on the standard contractual clauses promulgated and recently substantially revised by the European Commission for such data transfers. However, recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding such transfers, in particular in relation to transfers to the United States.

Moreover, following the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the GDPR was transposed into U.K. law (the “U.K. GDPR”) as supplemented by the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018, which currently imposes the same obligations as the GDPR in most material respects. Failure to comply with the U.K. GDPR can result in fines up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of annual global revenues of the violator. However, the U.K. GDPR will not automatically incorporate changes made to the GDPR going forward (which would need to be specifically incorporated by the U.K. Government), which creates a risk of divergent parallel regimes and related uncertainty. For example, in 2021, the European Commission announced an adequacy decision concluding that the United Kingdom ensures an equivalent level of data protection to the GDPR, which provides some relief regarding the legality of continued personal data flows from the EEA to the United Kingdom. This adequacy determination will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission renews or extends it and may be modified or revoked in the interim. We cannot predict how the U.K. GDPR and other U.K. privacy and data security laws, rules or regulations may develop, including as compared to the GDPR, nor can we predict the effects of divergent laws and related guidance. Moreover, the U.K. Government has launched a public consultation on proposed reforms to the data protection framework in the United Kingdom. This may lead to future divergence and variance between the two regimes.
Additionally, many statutory requirements, both in the United States and abroad, include obligations for companies to notify individuals of data breaches involving certain personal information. For example, laws in all U.S. states require businesses to provide notice to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. These laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is difficult and may be costly. Moreover, states have been frequently amending existing laws, requiring attention to changing regulatory requirements. We also may be contractually required to notify consumers or other third parties of a cyber-attack, data security breach or other similar incident.
There are a number of pending legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business. We expect that our efforts to comply with the GDPR, U.K. GDPR, GLBA, CCPA, and other regulatory and legislative requirements will continue to require substantial investments, including investments in compliance processes and technical infrastructure. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data security requirements, including requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. 
We are engaged in ongoing privacy and data security compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with the requirements of privacy and data security laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, and other obligations. Many of these privacy and data security laws, rules and regulations are subject to change and uncertain and inconsistent interpretation and enforcement, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or obligations, or our practices of the features of our services.

Data Security. While we take reasonable efforts to secure our customers’ information, financial technology companies such as us are prone to cyber-attacks, data security breaches and other similar incidents by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or to disrupt our ability to provide access to our products and services. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly phishing attacks), vendor errors, and general hacking have become more prevalent in the industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will occur on our systems in the future. We regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable accounts or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, or other objectionable ends. Cyber-attacks may cause interruptions to our platform, degrade the user experience, cause users to lose confidence and trust in our platform, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect company data or the information that we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees to disclose information in order to gain access to our data. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time.

Human Capital
Our Team. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 2,700 full-time equivalent employees working out of our headquarters in Seattle, Washington, several other office locations, or remotely. None of our team members are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe the positive relationship between our customers, our team members and our mission-oriented culture differentiates us and is a key driver of our business success. Attracting, recruiting, developing, and retaining globally diverse talent enables us to deliver on our brand promise to customers and serve our broad set of stakeholders. We are focused on supporting our employees from recruitment and onboarding, to ongoing development, and have implemented programs designed to encourage engagement, and personal wellness. 
Our Culture and Values: Culture is the set of habits that allows a group of people to cooperate by assumption rather than by negotiation. It is composed of artifacts, norms, values, and behaviors - and it is not what we say, but what we do without asking. Culture serves as the invisible glue that binds together the intangibles (e.g., how we treat each other, how we make decisions, how we serve our customers) with business objectives.
Remitly’s Cultural Values define our ideal behaviors and interactions. Each of us as individuals, teams, and as a company has strengths and growth opportunities. We view our values as a north star and, with a ‘growth mindset’, our aspiration to work towards. Our values give us a common language to guide our work, behavior and decision making every day.

Remitly’s culture is the foundation of our success. We invested in our culture and values the day we started this company more than a decade ago, and we will continue to invest for the decades to come. Our values are not stagnant. Every so often we take a step back to refresh our values, and we did so in 2022, with the goal of continuously improving as we grow to serve millions of new customers, attract exceptional employees, globalize, grasp opportunities and face challenges in our ever-changing world. Our cultural values define how we get things done. At Remitly we believe that how we accomplish our work leads to great outcomes in what we accomplish. 
We’re intentional about infusing our values into everything we do. We actively use them in our daily conversations, for recognizing outstanding contributions, throughout our People processes, and when giving each other feedback to grow our careers and our impact. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) is deeply rooted in our purpose and mission at Remitly. Our focus every day is to tirelessly deliver for our customers, many of whom may be underrepresented in the countries they've migrated to and have historically been left out of traditional financial systems. Effectively serving millions of customers sending money home to their families across the globe requires global teams of committed individuals who demonstrate a deep level of compassion, genuine curiosity, and who value varied lived experiences, perspectives and backgrounds. Remitly’s working environment and culture are designed to unlock our employees’ best thinking and inspire impact from our diverse teams. All of this is made clear by the way we live our cultural values, as we engage with each other, our customers and the immigrant communities we serve all over the world. 
To ensure we create an inclusive culture that embraces the diversity of our employees, we have invested in resources and created programs that encourage continuous learning and constructive dialogue at all levels of our organization, such as executive members co-hosting DEI monthly meetings with our Vice President of Environment Social Governance; creating working groups of senior leaders, managers, and individual contributors focused on improving policies and practices to improve employee development, belonging and hiring; supporting a variety of employee resource groups; offering inclusive interview training; and investing in tools that deliver weekly DEI-related learning content to employees. 
Employee Engagement and Retention. Employee voice and engagement is a cornerstone to how we foster a culture of belonging. This focus allows all of us to do our personal best to deliver for our customers every day. Activities and initiatives include annual employee engagement surveys, pulse surveys, ongoing feedback sessions, office hours, and 1:1s. Our cultural values are used as a common language for feedback, recognition and candidate assessment. Our cultural values are also woven throughout our employee lifecycle processes including onboarding, performance management, and development planning, which help us to attract, inspire, and retain a world-class and globally diverse team.
Learning and Development. We encourage our employees to aim for the stars and continuously improve not only in tirelessly delivering to our customers, but also investing in themselves. We provide our employees with ongoing professional development, educational resources and leadership opportunities, reimbursements for continued education and encourage conference attendance, utilization of online educational curriculum, reimbursement for travel to our corridor countries, and participation in customer empathy programs and workshops. 
Benefits and Compensation. We strive to offer market-competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain employees for the long-term. Equity ownership is a key element of our total compensation program, allowing employees to share in our successes and aligning their interests with our long-term goals. We believe that providing employees with equity ownership in our company encourages long-term impact, creates an owner mindset, and is fundamental to employee engagement and to our employees feeling valued and recognized. We award promotions and performance equity grants based on an employee’s customer and business impact and their demonstration of our values. To ensure fair and equitable pay, we benchmark our employee compensation with external sources and audit for pay parity annually during the performance cycle.
We strive to provide comprehensive benefits and services that help meet the unique needs of our employees, including benefits such as medical, dental, and vision insurance, a health savings account with company contribution, family and medical leave, flexible work schedules, paid holidays and flexible vacation time, as well as mental wellness access from Modern Health, which provides coaching and counseling services for employees and dependents in their household. To support parents and families, we offer benefits through Maven so all employees on any path to parenthood have 24/7 access to virtual care, ranging from prenatal support and family planning, to delivery, postpartum, and pediatrics that support diverse family structures. Remitly also participates in the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) so our teammates who identify as Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People have access to the care they need. We sponsor a 401(k) plan that includes a matching contribution and offer financial coaching through a third-party provider. We also offer an employee stock purchase plan to enable eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a discount via accumulated payroll deductions.
New Ways of Working. Employee flexibility and well-being is paramount to us. We provide all employees productivity and collaboration tools and resources, including training and toolkits to help managers effectively lead and manage remote teams. We are vested in providing equitable experiences, regardless of work mode. All employees are eligible for ergonomic assessments. For employees who have hybrid schedules, we offer in-office benefits like subsidized parking and public transportation benefits. For employees who are distributed, we offer remote work benefits such as home office set up stipends. We believe humans also benefit from in-person connection, so we bring our teams together for ‘moments that matter’ to create better products and services for our customers and to build stronger teams across the company.

Corporate Philanthropy
When immigrant communities have access to financial tools and resources, they change the future for themselves and their loved ones. They also transform the local economies where they live and work, as well as the countries where they send money. Through Remitly’s charitable giving programs, we aspire to invest in and support the organizations and coalitions who are committed to improving the economic, financial and social inclusion of immigrants and their families. In 2021, we joined Pledge 1%, a global movement that encourages and empowers companies of all sizes and stages to donate 1% of their staff time, product, profit, and/or equity to social good. Our major corporate philanthropy programs include the following:
Pledge 1%. Our Pledge 1% commitment publicly acknowledges our intent to give back and expand our social impact in order to sustainably further our mission to expand the financial inclusion of immigrants. As such, in July 2021, our board of directors approved the reservation of up to 1,819,609 shares of our common stock (which was approximately 1.0% of our fully-diluted capitalization as of June 30, 2021) that we may issue to or for the benefit of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation or a similar charitable organization pursuant to our Pledge 1% commitment in equal installments over ten years. In 2021 and 2022, we donated 181,961 shares of our common stock each year to the Remitly Philanthropic Fund. We also have a multifaceted social good program that aligns with our Pledge 1% philanthropic commitment. This includes:
Corporate and Employee Giving. In 2022, we funded nearly $110,000 in financial assistance through our Remitly Scholars Program that helps students at the University of the Philippines and the Mapua Institute of Technology, pay for school fees, books, food, school supplies and other resources they might need to successfully graduate from college. In addition, in the past year, Remitly, Inc. and our employees have collectively donated over $130,000 to support immigrant communities and helped strengthen community resilience by responding to disasters around the world.
Product Deployment. When global crises and natural disasters occur, especially in the global south where many of our customers' families reside, we support our customers who need to send money home quickly by providing fee waivers so more of their remittances can be deployed to address immediate needs. In 2022, we provided over $500,000 in fee waivers and donations to support customers responding to their loved ones impacted by heavy storm damage in Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico.
Volunteering. In 2022, we focused on volunteer opportunities that addressed financial inclusion, family support for immigrants and refugees, and youth education. Volunteer events included employees volunteering as mentors and career coaches, offering time and experience to students entering into the technology field. We also delivered several Employee Action Guides that provided Remitly employees with self-paced learning and mental health resources that could be shared with their online and offline networks. 
Civic Engagement. In addition to volunteering, we encourage our employees to use their voice in local civic processes, register to vote, and learn about how to engage with community leaders to influence change. We hosted workshops to help employees learn about civic engagement and community issues.
