General
We are a leading health insurance marketplace with a technology and service platform that provides consumer engagement, education and enrollment solutions. Our platform integrates proprietary and third-party developed educational content regarding health insurance plans with decision support tools to aid consumers in what has traditionally been a confusing and opaque purchasing process and to help them obtain the health insurance product that meets their individual health and economic needs. Our omni-channel consumer engagement platform enables consumers to use our services online, through interactive chat, or by telephone with a licensed insurance agent. We have created a marketplace that offers consumers a broad choice of insurance products that includes thousands of Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, individual and family health insurance, small business insurance and other ancillary health insurance products from over 170 health insurance carriers. We strive to be a trusted partner to the consumer and are licensed to sell health insurance products in all fifty states and the District of Columbia. 
Over the last three years, we have increasingly shifted our focus towards Medicare products and deemphasized individual and family health insurance products. This shift has enabled us to capitalize on (1) the strong demographic trends, with 10,000 people on average turning 65 every day over the next 11 years, driving a large and growing segment of the population eligible for Medicare across the United States, (2) the increasing proportion of the Medicare eligible population that is choosing commercial insurance solutions, and (3) the growing consumer demand for online tools to compare and enroll in Medicare insurance plans. Our shift towards Medicare has enabled us to mitigate the impact of the Affordable Care Act on our business, which established competing government exchanges that offer certain non-Medicare, Affordable Care Act-compliant individual and family health insurance plans.
We operate our business in two segments: (1) Medicare, and (2) Individual, Family and Small Business. Our Medicare segment represents the majority of our business and constituted approximately 84% of our revenue in 2018. We derive the majority of our revenues from commission payments paid to us by health insurance carriers related to insurance plans that have been purchased by members who used our services. Our platform and services are free to the consumer, and we are not responsible for the payment of consumer health insurance claims. 
On January 22, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Wealth, Health and Life Advisors, LLC, more commonly known as GoMedigap, a technology-enabled provider of Medicare Supplement enrollment services. GoMedigap has built a leading consumer acquisition and engagement platform focused on meeting the Medicare Supplement insurance needs of its individual customers with a technology-enabled, consumer-centric approach that aligns with our mission and operations. This strategic acquisition significantly enhanced our growing presence in the Medicare Supplement market, put us in a stronger position with carriers and strategic partners and has helped us to us to accelerate our projected Medicare plan enrollment growth. 
On January 23, 2019, we entered into an underwriting agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC as representatives of the several underwriters to issue and sell 2,400,000 shares of the our common stock par value $0.001 per share in a public offering, and also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 360,000 shares of common stock, which they exercised, for a total of 2,760,000 shares of common stock. The offering closed on January 28, 2019, at a price of $48.50 per share, for total net proceeds of $126.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital. 
We were incorporated in Delaware in November 1997. We make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, available free of charge on the Investor Relations page of our web site (www.ehealth.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information that can be accessed on or through our websites is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, a copy of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is located at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room can be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding our filings at http://www.sec.gov.
Our Business Model
5

Our business is comprised of two operating segments:
•Medicare and 
•Individual, Family and Small Business 
These segments reflect the way our management evaluates our business performance and manages our operations.

Medicare

Through a combination of demand generation strategies, we actively market, a large selection of Medicare-related health insurance plans, and to a lesser extent, ancillary products such as dental and vision insurance, to our Medicare-eligible customers. Our Medicare ecommerce platforms (www.eHealthMedicare.com, www.Medicare.com, www.PlanPrescriber.com and www.GoMedigap.com) and telephonic enrollment capabilities enable consumers to research, compare and purchase Medicare-related health insurance plans, including Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. To the extent that we assist in the sale of Medicare-related insurance plans as a health insurance agent, either online or telephonically, we generate revenue as a result of commissions we receive from health insurance carriers. In the first effective plan year of a Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, after the health insurance carrier approves the application, we are paid a fixed commission that is prorated for the number of months remaining in the calendar year. Additionally, if the plan is the first Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D prescription drug plan issued to the member, we may receive a higher commission rate that covers a full twelve-month period, regardless of the month the plan was effective. Beginning with and subsequent to the second plan year, we typically receive fixed, monthly commissions for Medicare Advantage plans and fixed, annual commissions for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. We are paid commissions for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans for which we are the broker of record, typically until either the plan is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the plan. Commission payments we receive for Medicare Supplement plans sold by us typically are a percentage of the premium on the plan and are paid to us until either the plan is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the plan. Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan pricing is approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and is not subject to negotiation or discounting by health insurance carriers or our competitors. Similarly, Medicare Supplement plan pricing is set by the health insurance carrier and approved by state regulators and is not subject to negotiation or discounting by health insurance carriers or our competitors. 
Individual, Family and Small Business
We actively market individual and family health insurance and small business health insurance plans through our ecommerce platforms (www.eHealth.com and www.eHealthInsurance.com), and generate revenue as a result of commissions we receive from health insurance carriers whose health insurance plans are purchased through us, as well as commission override payments we receive for achieving sales volume thresholds or other objectives. In addition, we market a variety of ancillary products, including but not limited to, short-term limited duration, dental, vision, and life insurance plans. These ancillary products are offered to our individual and family and small business customers and are also sold on a standalone basis. The commission payments we receive for individual and family, small business and ancillary health insurance plans are either a percentage of the premium our customers pay for those plans or a flat amount per member per month, and vary depending on the carrier that is offering the plan, the state where the plan was sold and the size of the small business. Commission payments are typically made to us on a monthly basis until either the policy is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy. Health insurance pricing, which is set by the health insurance carrier and approved by state regulators, is not subject to negotiation or discounting by health insurance carriers or our competitors.
Non-Commission Revenue Sources
Within our two operating segments, we earn commission revenue, as well as non-commission revenue, or other revenue, which includes online sponsorship and advertising, technology licensing and lead referral revenues.
Online Sponsorship and Advertising. We generate revenue from our sponsorship and advertising program that allows carriers to purchase advertising space for non-Medicare products on our website and Medicare plan related advertising on a separate website that we develop, host and maintain. In return, we typically are paid either a flat fee, a monthly fee, or a performance-based fee based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications.
Technology Licensing. We generate revenue from licensing the use of our health insurance ecommerce technology. Our technology platform enables health insurance carriers to market and distribute health insurance plans 
6

online. Health insurance carriers that license our technology typically pay us implementation fees and performance-based fees that are based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications.

Lead Referrals. We generate revenue from the sale of Medicare-related and individual and family health insurance leads generated by our ecommerce platforms and our marketing activities.
Additional financial information about our company is included in Part II, Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Industry Background
The purchase and sale of health insurance has historically been a complex, time-consuming and paper-intensive process. This complexity can make it difficult to make informed health insurance decisions. In addition, the human error that arises from traditional paper-intensive distribution has historically resulted in a high number of incomplete and inaccurate applications being submitted to health insurance carriers. Incomplete and inaccurate paper applications often result in back-and-forth communications, delay and additional cost. The Internet’s convenient, information-rich and interactive nature offers the opportunity to provide consumers with more organized information, a broader choice of plans and a more efficient process than have typically been available from traditional health insurance distribution channels. We believe that over time the Internet will become an increasingly important channel for researching and enrolling into health insurance coverage, similar to other consumer-focused industries such as travel, financial services and shopping.
Medicare is a federal program that provides persons sixty-five years of age and over, and some persons under the age of sixty-five who meet certain conditions, with hospital and medical insurance benefits. Medicare beneficiaries choose between Medicare Fee-For-Service and Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare Fee-For-Service is a government plan where the consumer is responsible for select health care related payments with no limit on out-of-pocket expenses. To increase coverage, Medicare Fee-For-Service beneficiaries can purchase commercially offered Medicare Supplement plans. Medicare Advantage is an alternative to Medicare Fee-For-Service. CMS contracts with private health insurance carriers under Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. Under these programs, the government pays insurers a fixed amount of money each year per enrollee to cover health care expenses rather than making payments directly to providers under Medicare Fee-For-Service. Medicare Advantage plans are required to cover the same services as Medicare Fee-For-Service and usually cover a variety of other health care services and include a cap on out-of-pocket spending for the consumer. 
Individual and family products are typically purchased by consumers under 65 years of age that do not have coverage through their employer. Small business group health insurance addresses the health insurance needs of businesses with 100 or fewer employees, although we have chosen to focus on employer groups of 20 or fewer employees. Individual, family and small business health insurance has historically been sold by independent insurance agents and, to a lesser degree, directly by insurance companies. Many of these agents are self-employed or part of small agencies, and they typically service only their local communities. In addition, many of these agents sell health insurance from a limited number of insurance carriers (in some cases only one), resulting in a reduced selection of plans for the consumer.
Health Care Reform 
In March 2010, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and related amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law. The Affordable Care Act has primarily impacted our business of selling individual, family, and small business insurance plans. These health care reform laws contain provisions that have changed and will continue to change the health insurance industry in substantial ways. Among several other provisions, these laws and the regulations implementing them include a mandate requiring individuals to maintain health insurance or face tax penalties, which has been repealed effective in 2019; a mandate that certain employers offer and contribute to their employees group health insurance coverage or face tax penalties if they do not do so; prohibitions against insurance companies using pre-existing health conditions as a reason to deny an application for health insurance; requirements for minimum individual and small business health insurance benefit levels, including prohibitions on lifetime coverage limits and limitations on annual coverage limits; medical loss ratio requirements that require each health insurance carrier to spend a certain percentage of their premium revenue on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve health care quality; establishment of state and/or federal health insurance exchanges to facilitate access to, and the purchase of, health insurance; Medicaid expansion so that a greater number of individuals will be insured under Medicaid programs; and subsidies and cost-sharing credits to make health insurance more affordable for those below certain income levels.
7

Health care reform established annual open enrollment periods for the purchase of individual and family health insurance. Individuals and families generally are not able to purchase individual and family health insurance outside of the annual enrollment periods, unless they qualify for a special enrollment period as a result of certain qualifying events, such as losing employer-sponsored health insurance or moving to another state. Moreover, in order to be eligible for a subsidy, qualified individuals must purchase subsidy-qualifying health plans, known as qualified health plans, through a government-run health insurance exchange during the open enrollment period or a special enrollment period. While they are not required to do so, government-run exchanges are permitted to allow agents and brokers to enroll individuals and families into qualified health plans through them. The Federally Facilitated Marketplace, or FFM, run by CMS operated some part of the health insurance exchange in 36 states during the last health care open enrollment period. Our enrollment of individuals and families into qualified health plans to date has generally occurred through the FFM. 
Health care reform has adversely impacted our individual and family health insurance plan business and resulted in our shifting our primary focus to the sale of Medicare related health insurance.
Our Growth Strategy
We believe our consumer engagement platform and approach to bringing value to consumers is unique in the health insurance market and creates significant opportunities for growth in our core Medicare business and in other areas of the health insurance market. We intend to pursue the following strategies to further advance our business.
Increase Medicare Membership and Commissions
We intend to enroll additional Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan members for our commercial carrier partners. In addition to capitalizing on the existing market opportunity, there is a significant unmet need represented by consumers that have insufficient coverage and a suboptimal plan. We believe that our platform of proprietary content, decision support tools and enrollment solutions and go-to-market strategies in direct-to-consumer and partner channels, can allow us to reach a large proportion of this underserved market and grow our membership and revenues more rapidly than the overall Medicare market.
Expand Consumer Relationship and Increase Member Retention
We continually invest in our consumer engagement platform to add products and services that enhance user experience and build lasting relationships with our members. We believe adding products and services improves consumer engagement and increases our revenue opportunity. We also believe that increased consumer engagement will increase customer retention, our revenue and our cash flow. 
Increase Online Enrollment to Improve Margins and Enhance Operating Leverage
We view our consumer engagement platform as unique in the Medicare market and as attractive to the growing number of Medicare beneficiaries who prefer to research, compare and purchase health insurance online. The percentage of members who submit applications for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products online through our platform has substantially increased from 10% in 2017 to 16% in 2018. Applications submitted online include applications submitted with no assistance or some assistance from call center agents prior to the final application submission. We are able to scale growth more rapidly and at an incrementally lower cost basis though our online platform, which significantly reduces our reliance on and financial and managerial resources associated with our contact center operations. We have successfully reduced our variable marketing cost per approved Medicare member year-over-year by 12% and 9% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Expand Our Strategic Relationships
The value of our consumer engagement and enrollment solution platform allows us to work closely with strategic partners in the health care market to leverage their relationships with consumers. In 2018, we had strategic relationships with major retail pharmacies in the United States, with leading hospital systems in the United States and with select financial and affinity marketing organizations to expand the availability of our platform to more consumers. Through greater data integration, co-branding and further investments to improve the customer experience with our platform, we believe that we can create significant value for each of our partners and further expand each of our partner relationships. 
Selectively Grow our Consumer Engagement Platform Outside of the Medicare Market
8

Our current focus is to operate our individual and family plan business profitably and grow the small business portion of our business. We believe that our engagement, education and enrollment platform provides high-value solutions for consumers in these markets. To capitalize on our small business opportunity, we established a dedicated small business unit in 2016.
Acquire Capabilities that Leverage our Consumer Engagement Platform
We intend to pursue strategic relationships or acquisitions that expand our platform, provide additional capabilities or enable us to access adjacent markets within the broader health insurance and related customer facing segments of the healthcare industry. We acquired GoMedigap in January 2018 to help us expand our presence and engagement capabilities in the Medicare Supplement market.
Our Platforms and Technology 
Our ecommerce platforms and consumer engagement solutions are built to provide market leading information, decision support and transactional services to health insurance customers across the country. Our ecommerce platforms organize and present voluminous and complex health insurance information in an objective format that empowers individuals, families and small businesses to research, analyze, compare and purchase a wide variety of health insurance plans.
Elements of our platforms include:
Plan Comparisons and Recommendations. We offer online comparison and recommendation tools that process and simplify voluminous health insurance information according to each customer's specific insurance need. Our ecommerce platform enables consumers to compare and personalize health insurance options based on plan characteristics such as price, plan type, coverage limits, deductible amount, co-payment amount, in-network and out-of-network benefits. After entering relevant information on our website, our platforms allow consumers to instantly receive a list of applicable health insurance plans and rate and benefit information in an easy-to-understand format.
Online Application and Enrollment Forms. Health insurance applications vary widely by carrier and state.  Our proprietary Application Tool allows us to capture each insurance application’s unique business rules and build a corresponding online application in a XML format.  Our online application process offers our consumers significant improvements over the traditional, paper-intensive application process. It employs dynamic business logic to help individuals and families complete the application and enrollment forms correctly in real-time. This reduces delay resulting from application rework, a significant problem with traditional health insurance distribution, where incomplete applications are mailed back and forth between the consumer, the traditional agent and the carrier. We further simplify the enrollment process by accepting electronic signature and electronic payment from our consumers.
Customer and Carrier Data Interchange. Our digital data interface technology integrates our online application process with health insurance carriers’ technology systems, enabling us to electronically deliver our consumers’ applications to health insurance carriers. This expedites the loading of insurance product inventory in to our various shopping experiences and accelerates the application process by eliminating manual delivery. We also receive alerts and data from carriers, such as notification of approval or a request from a carrier for a consumer’s medical records for underwriting purposes, which we then relay electronically to the consumer. These features of our service help prevent applications from becoming delayed or rejected through inactivity of the consumer or the carrier.
Call Center Technology Systems. Our proprietary agent-assist management systems enable us to provide a full range of customer service tasks in an efficient and personalized manner while complying with Medicare and health insurance regulatory requirements. Call center agents have script-on-screen tools that align to health insurance needs and leverage a common back office platform that powers our direct-to-consumer shopping experience. These systems also have customer relationship management tools that can track each consumer throughout the application process, obtain real-time updates from the carrier, generate automated emails specific to each consumer and access a cross-sell engine and dashboard to identify and track cross-sell opportunities. Our auto-email system is feature-rich with HTML capability, customizable merge tags, granular segmentation and tracking capability.
Customer Data Platform. We have developed proprietary recommendation algorithms that are carrier agnostic and are designed based on the several million customer assistance encounters we have facilitated.

Carrier Relationships
We have developed strategic relationships with leading health insurance carriers in the United States, enabling us to offer thousands of health insurance plans online.  We have relationships with a large number of Medicare-related, individual and family, small business and ancillary health insurance plan carriers, including large national carriers and well-established regional carriers. Many of these major carriers have been selling their products through us for over ten years. In many cases, we have back-office integration with major carriers allowing us to submit customer applications efficiently and cost-effectively, which is an area of competitive differentiation for our business. We typically enter into contractual agency relationships with health insurance carriers that are non-exclusive and terminable on short notice by either party for any reason. Health insurance carriers often have the ability to terminate or amend our agreements unilaterally on short notice, including provisions in our agreements relating to our commission rates.  
Revenue derived from Humana represented approximately 22%, 20% and 22% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenue derived from carriers owned by UnitedHealthcare represented approximately 19%, 23% and 19% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenue derived from carriers owned by Aetna represented approximately 14%, 10% and 11% of our total revenue in each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Marketing
We focus on building brand awareness, increasing individual, family and small business customer visits to our websites, increasing Medicare customer visits to our website and telephonic sales centers and converting these visitors into members. Our marketing initiatives are varied and numerous. They include:
Direct Marketing. Our direct member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our website addresses (www.eHealth.com, www.eHealthInsurance.com, www.Medicare.com, www.eHealthMedicare.com, www.PlanPrescriber.com and www.GoMedigap.com) either directly or through algorithmic search listings on Internet search engines and directories. Our direct marketing programs include direct mail, email marketing, search engine optimization, and television, radio and print advertising. We recognize expenses in our direct member acquisition channel in the period in which they are incurred.
Online Advertising. Our online advertising member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our website or call centers through paid keyword search advertising from search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!, paid social platforms like Facebook, as well as various Internet marketing programs such as display advertising and retargeting campaigns. Our online advertising programs are delivered across all Internet-enabled devices, including desktop computers, tablet computers and smart phones. We recognize expenses associated with search advertising in the period in which the consumer clicks on the advertisement.
Marketing Partners. Our marketing partner member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our website and call centers through a network comprised of hundreds of partners that drive consumers to our ecommerce platform and call centers. These partners include health care industry participants, such as pharmacies, hospital networks and insurance carriers; financial and online services partners in industries such as banking, insurance and mortgage; affiliate organizations; online advertisers and content providers that are specialists in paid and unpaid (algorithmic) search, as well as specialists in other types of Internet marketing; and off-line lead generators who specialize in traditional direct marketing channels, such as direct mail and television advertising. 
We generally compensate our marketing partners for referrals based on the consumer submitting a health insurance application on our platform, regardless of whether the consumer's application is approved by the health insurance carrier, or for the referral of a Medicare-related lead to us by the marketing partner. Some of our partners such as pharmacies and hospital networks are not compensated for referrals to us as a result of legal requirements. These organizations have relationships with us to provide their customers and patients with our consumer experience and to help them find the plan that best meets their needs. Some of our marketing partners have tiered arrangements where the amount we pay the marketing partner per submitted application increases as the volume of submitted applications we receive from the marketing partner increases. We recognize these expenditures in the period when a marketing partner’s referral results in the submission of a health insurance application. Alternatively, if a marketing partner is licensed to sell health insurance, we may share a percentage of the commission revenue we earn from the health insurance carrier for each member referred by that partner. In our Medicare business, our current emphasis is on reducing the contribution from the lead aggregator marketing channel that is characterized by high acquisition costs and emphasizing strategic partnerships including relationships with health care industry participants, such as pharmacies and hospital networks, and with affiliate organizations where our acquisition costs may be significantly lower.
10

Because the total volume of submitted applications that we receive from our marketing partners is largely outside of our control, particularly during any short-term period, and because of our tiered marketing partner arrangements, we could incur expenses in excess of, or below, the amounts we had planned in periods of rapid change in the volume of submitted applications from marketing partner referrals. Similar to our marketing partner channel, expenses in our online advertising channel will increase or decrease in relation to any increase or decrease in consumers referred to our website as a result of search engine advertising or retargeting campaigns.  Increases in submitted applications resulting from marketing partner referrals or visitors to our website from our online advertising channel has in the past, and could in the future, result in marketing and advertising expenses significantly higher than our expectations. 
Technology and Content
We have a technology and content team that is responsible for ongoing enhancements to the features and functionality of our ecommerce platform, which we believe are critical to maintaining our technology leadership position in the industry. A large number of our technology and content employees are located in our subsidiary in Xiamen, China. There are many risks associated with having an operation and doing business in China. Information regarding risks involving our operations in China is included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation and Compliance
We distribute health insurance plans in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia.  The health insurance industry is heavily regulated. In addition to the Affordable Care Act, each of these jurisdictions has its own rules and regulations relating to the offer and sale of health insurance plans, typically administered by a department of insurance. State insurance departments have administrative powers relating to, among other things: regulating premium prices; granting and revoking licenses to transact insurance business; approving individuals and entities to which, and circumstances under which, commissions can be paid; regulating advertising, marketing and trade practices; monitoring broker and agent conduct; and imposing continuing education requirements. We are required to maintain valid life and/or health agency and/or agent licenses in each jurisdiction in which we transact health insurance business.
In addition to state regulations, we also are subject to regulations and guidelines issued by CMS that place a number of requirements on health insurance carriers and agents and brokers in connection with the marketing and sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. We are subject to similar requirements of state insurance departments with respect to our marketing and sale of Medicare Supplement plans. CMS and state insurance department regulations and guidelines include a number of prohibitions regarding the ability to contact Medicare-eligible individuals and place many restrictions on the marketing of Medicare-related plans.  For example, our health insurance carrier partners are required to file with CMS and state departments of insurance certain of our platforms, our call center scripts and other marketing materials we use to market Medicare-related plans. In some instances, CMS or state departments of insurance must approve the material before we use it. In addition, the laws and regulations applicable to the marketing and sale of Medicare-related plans are ambiguous, complex and, particularly with respect to regulations and guidance issued by CMS for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, change frequently.
We are subject to various federal and state privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements. These laws govern our collection, use, disclosure, protection and maintenance of the individually-identifiable information that we collect from consumers.  For example, we are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.  HIPAA and regulations adopted pursuant to HIPPA require us to maintain the privacy of individually-identifiable health information that we collect on behalf of health insurance carriers, implement measures to safeguard such information and provide notification in the event of a breach in the privacy or confidentiality of such information. In addition, we have entered into contracts with health insurance carriers and others regarding the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure or disposal of sensitive personal information. The use and disclosure of certain data that we collect from consumers is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and state statutes implementing GLBA, which generally require brokers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before sharing such information with a third party, and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. We regularly assess our compliance with privacy and security requirements. These requirements are evolving, and states are beginning to adopt additional requirements. In addition to government action, health insurance carrier expectations relating to privacy and security protections are increasing and evolving. We have incurred significant costs to develop new processes and procedures and to adopt new technology in an effort to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations and carrier expectations and to protect against cybersecurity risks and security breaches. We expect to continue to do so in the future. Violations of federal and state privacy and security laws and other contractual requirements may result in significant liability and expense, damage to our reputation or

Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We also have filed patent applications that relate to certain of our technology and business processes.
Competition
The market for selling health insurance plans is highly competitive. Our competitors include government entities, including government-run health insurance exchanges established as a result of health care reform; health insurance carriers; other health insurance agents and brokers; and companies that use the Internet and other means to attract individuals interested in purchasing health insurance and generate revenue by referring these individuals to us or one of our competitors.
Government. In connection with our marketing of Medicare related health insurance plans, we compete with the federal government’s original Medicare program. CMS also offers Medicare plan online enrollment, information and comparison tools and has established call centers for the sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. CMS has regulatory authority over the Medicare Advantage program and can influence the competitiveness of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans compared to the original Medicare program, as well as the compensation that health insurance carriers are allowed to pay us.
Insurance carriers. Many health insurance carriers directly market and sell their plans to consumers through call centers and their own websites. Although we offer health insurance plans for many of these carriers, they also compete with us by offering their plans directly to consumers and, to a much lesser extent, to small businesses. Health insurance carriers have become more experienced in marketing their products directly to consumers, both over the Internet and through more traditional channels, which has resulted in increased competition.
Other agents and brokers. We compete with agents and brokers who offer and sell health insurance plans utilizing traditional offline distribution channels as well as the Internet. Our current competitors include the tens of thousands of local insurance agents across the United States who sell health insurance plans in their communities. A number of these agents operate websites and provide an online shopping experience for consumers interested in purchasing health insurance. In addition, a number of online health insurance agents like us generate demand over the Internet and sell health insurance to individuals over the Internet and using call centers. Some of these online agents have agreements with CMS, similar to us, that allow them to enroll subsidy-eligible individuals in qualified health insurance plans over the Internet in the states where the federal government is operating the health insurance exchange. As a result, we compete with these companies for consumers eligible for health care reform subsidies as well as for consumers who are not subsidy-eligible.
Internet marketers. There are many internet marketing companies that use the Internet to find consumers interested in purchasing health insurance and are compensated for referring those consumers to agents and health insurance carriers. We compete with internet marketing companies for individuals who are looking to purchase health insurance.
Seasonality
The majority of our commissions revenue is recognized in the fourth quarter of each calendar year as a result of our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), which we adopted using the full retrospective transition method on January 1, 2018 and which is further discussed in Note 1-Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have historically sold a significant portion of the Medicare plans that we sell during the year in the fourth quarter during the Medicare annual enrollment period, when Medicare-eligible individuals are permitted to change their Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage for the following year. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, 61%, 52% and 49%, respectively, of our Medicare plan-related applications were submitted during the fourth quarter. As a result, we generate a significant portion of our commission revenues related to new Medicare plan-related enrollments in the fourth quarter. 
The annual open enrollment period for individual and family health insurance also takes place in the fourth quarter of the calendar year, resulting in seasonality of individual and family plan submitted applications volume. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, 64%, 52% and 33%, respectively, of our individual and family plan-related applications were submitted during the fourth 
12

quarter. As a result, we generate a significant portion of our commission revenues related to individual and family plan-related enrollments in the fourth quarter. 
Our marketing and advertising expenses are typically lower in each of our first through third quarters compared to the fourth quarter. We incur a significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses in the fourth quarter as a result of the Medicare annual enrollment period and the open enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act. Our marketing and advertising increases in the fourth quarter as a result of increased amounts owed to our marketing partners in connection with lead referral arrangements as well as an increase in the number of health insurance applications submitted on our ecommerce platforms referred to us by our marketing partners. We also typically incur an increase in other marketing and advertising related expenses in the fourth quarter. We expect this seasonal trend in marketing and advertising expenses to continue in 2019.
In preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period during 2018, 2017 and 2016, and to a lesser extent the open enrollment period for individual and family health insurance plans during the same periods, we began ramping up our customer care center staff during the third and fourth quarters to handle the anticipated increased volume of health insurance transactions, which resulted in higher customer care and enrollment expenses in the third and fourth quarters. We expect this seasonal trend in customer care and enrollment expenses to continue in 2019.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,079 full-time employees, of which 59 were in marketing and advertising, 569 were in customer care and enrollment, 289 were in technology and content and 162 were in general and administrative.
None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. As required under Chinese law, the employees in our Xiamen, China office established a labor union in January 2014. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.

ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
On April 6, 2018, a former California employee filed a complaint against us in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Sacramento.  The plaintiff’s complaint was filed pursuant to the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, purportedly on behalf of all current and former hourly-paid or non-exempt employees who work or have worked for us in California.  The complaint alleges that we violated a number of wage and hour laws with respect to these non-exempt employees, including, among other things, the failure to comply with California law as to (i) the payment of overtime wages; (ii) the payment of minimum wages; (iii) providing uninterrupted meal and rest periods, (iv) the payment of wages earned during employment and owed upon the termination of employment; (v) providing complete and accurate wage statements, (vi) keeping of accurate payroll records; and (vii) the proper reimbursement  for necessary business-related expenses and costs.  The complaint seeks allegedly unpaid wages, civil penalties and costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees.  Discovery has only recently commenced, and as a result we cannot estimate the likelihood of liability or the amount of potential damages.
On May 8, 2018, an individual filed a putative class action complaint against us.  The complaint alleges that we violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227(c) and certain provisions of 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200 promulgated thereunder by initiating or causing to be initiated telephone solicitations to telephone subscribers who registered their respective telephone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry.  The complaint alleged, among other things, that we (i) made more than one unsolicited telephone call to Plaintiff and putative class members within a 12-month period without express consent to place such calls in violation of 47 U.S.C. § 227(c)(5); and (ii) initiated calls for telemarketing purposes without instituting procedures that comply with regulatory minimum standards for implementing Do Not Call in violation of 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(d).  The complaint sought (i) an order certifying a class of individuals in the United States who (A) received more than one telephone call made by or on behalf of eHealth within a 12-month period; and (B) to a telephone number that had been registered with the National Do Not Call Registry for at least 30 days; (ii) an award of actual and statutory damages for each negligent violation to each member of the class pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(3)(B); (iii) an award of actual and statutory damages for each knowing and/or willful violation to each member of the class pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(3)(A); (iv) an injunction requiring us and our agents to cease all unsolicited telephone activities and otherwise protecting the interest of the class pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(3)(A); and (v) pre-judgment and post-judgment interest on monetary relief. A first amended complaint was filed in the action in September 2018 to add an additional plaintiff, and we answered the first amended complaint in October 2018. In October 2018, we also entered into a settlement agreement with the original plaintiff that included a release of the original plaintiff’s individual claims. The second plaintiff dismissed the first amended complaint without prejudice in November 2018.
In the ordinary course of our business, we have received and may continue to receive inquiries from state and federal regulators relating to various matters. We have become, and may in the future become, involved in litigation in the ordinary course of our business. If we are found to have violated laws or regulations in any jurisdiction, we could be subject to various fines and penalties, including revocation of our license to sell insurance in those states, and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Revocation of any of our licenses or penalties in one jurisdiction could cause our license to be revoked or for us to face penalties in other jurisdictions. In addition, without a health insurance license in a jurisdiction, carriers would not pay us commissions for the products we sold in that jurisdiction, and we would not be able to sell new health insurance products in that jurisdiction. We could also be harmed to the extent that related publicity damages our reputation as a trusted source of objective information relating to health insurance and its affordability. It could also be costly to defend ourselves regardless of the outcome.
