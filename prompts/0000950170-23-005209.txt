Item 1. Business
Company Overview

We are a leading diversified media company with television broadcasting, television network and digital media assets operating in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we owned, operated, programmed or provided sales and other services to 199 full power television stations and one AM radio station, including television stations owned by VIEs, in 116 markets in 39 states and the District of Columbia. The stations are affiliates of CBS, FOX, NBC, ABC, The CW, and MyNetworkTV (“MNTV”) and other broadcast television networks. Our television broadcasts reach approximately 39% of all U.S. television households after applying the Federal Communications Commission’s (“FCC”) ultra-high-frequency (“UHF”) discount and approximately 68% of all U.S. television households excluding the FCC UHF discount. We also own a 75.0% interest in The CW Network, LLC (“The CW”), one of the major broadcast networks in the U.S., NewsNation, a national cable news network which is distributed to approximately 70 million homes according to The Nielsen Company (US), LLC (“Nielsen”); two digital multicast networks, Antenna TV and Rewind TV, and a 31.3% ownership stake in Television Food Network, G.P. (“TV Food Network”). Our digital assets include more than 140 local websites, 280 mobile applications, 22 connected television applications, and six free-ad supported television (“FAST”) channels representing content from our local television stations, The CW, NewsNation, The Hill, and BestReviews as well as a suite of advertising solutions for brands and advertisers. Together, our other digital properties attracted almost 100 million unique visitors in December 2022 according to Comscore.
 
The stations we own and operate or provide services to provide free programming to consumers in our markets. This programming includes programs produced by third party networks with which the stations are affiliated, programs distributed by our owned and majority-owned broadcast networks to the affiliated stations, content that the stations produce, and syndicated programs that the stations acquire. The CW delivers 14-hours per week of primetime programming and three hours on weekends to its larger market affiliates, 24 hours of programming, seven days per week to its smaller market affiliates via CWPlus and, beginning in 2023, is expanding its programming on the weekends with LIV Golf. The CW also offers its network content as well as a library of other third-party content available for free to users via The CW App. Our NewsNation cable network primarily delivers national news programming supplemented by quality television series and movies. Our digital businesses include video and display advertising platforms that are delivered locally or nationally through our own and various third-party websites, mobile and over-the-top (“OTT”) applications, other digital media solutions to media publishers and advertisers and a consumer product reviews platform.

Our primary sources of revenue include contractual distribution revenue from retransmission consent and carriage agreements with distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable and satellite providers, and online video distributors (“OVDs”), companies that provide video content through internet streaming either directly or via our network affiliation partners as well as affiliation fees from local affiliates of The CW; the sale of commercial air time by the stations to local advertisers; the sale of commercial airtime by the stations and by our cable and broadcast networks to national advertisers; the sale of advertising on the stations’ websites, on our other owned or third party websites, and through mobile and OTT applications and other digital advertising solutions.

We also derive significant cash flows from our largest equity investment, a 31.3% interest in TV Food Network. TV Food Network operates two 24-hour television networks, Food Network and Cooking Channel, offering quality television, video, internet and mobile entertainment and information focusing on food and entertaining.
 
We seek to grow our revenue, operating income, EBITDA and cash flow by continuing to provide high quality content that attracts and engages audiences as our reach and consumer engagement are important to our distribution partners and advertisers. We use our industry-leading scale to assist us in securing distribution revenue streams, to provide advertisers with solutions across geographies and media types to engage both local and national audiences at scale and to leverage costs against a broader platform. In addition, we plan to continue to acquire or invest in businesses that can benefit from our scale, asset mix and record of management and cost discipline.
 
We are a Delaware corporation formed in 1996. Our principal offices are at 545 E. John Carpenter Freeway, Suite 700, Irving, TX 75062. Our telephone number is (972) 373-8800 and our website is http://www.nexstar.tv. The information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated herein by reference.
 

Recent Acquisition
 On September 30, 2022, we acquired a 75.0% ownership interest in The CW from affiliates of Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (collectively the “Sellers”) for no purchase consideration. Each of the Sellers retained a 12.5% ownership interest and will produce 12 original, scripted series for The CW primarily to air during the 2022/2023 broadcast season. The Sellers have granted us a call right and we granted each of the Sellers a put right for such Seller’s ownership interest beginning in August 2024 and June 2026, respectively. The acquisition solidifies our revenue opportunities as the largest owner of The CW-affiliated stations, diversifies our content outside of news, improves our national advertising opportunities, establishes us as a participant in advertising video-on-demand services via The CW App and is expected to create value by improving The CW’s ratings, revenue, and profitability.
 See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the above transaction.
 Competitive Strengths
Unique Combination of Scaled Local Audiences and Powerful National Reach. We believe we are the largest local broadcasting company in the United States, generating $5.2 billion of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our and our partners’ 200 broadcast stations in 116 local markets reach approximately 68% of U.S. television households (without applying the FCC UHF discount), which local reach is augmented by the national reach we have via our broadcast network, The CW, and our cable news network, NewsNation. According to Nielsen, The CW Network reaches 123.8 million television households, equal to the reach of the ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC broadcast networks and NewsNation reaches 70 million television households virtually equivalent to the reach of CNN and Fox News and greater than the reach of MSNBC. Together, Nexstar can provide both national reach and activation of local audiences at scale, representing a differentiated and attractive value proposition for advertisers and brands in an increasingly fragmented marketplace.
 Leading Local Franchises.  We are focused on building and maintaining leading local franchises in our 116 local markets which are core to our business model. In total, we employ approximately 5,500 local journalists and 1,500 local salespeople, produce almost 300,000 hours of local content, and have developed relationships with over 40,000 local advertisers. Each of the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to creates a highly recognizable local brand, primarily through the quality of local news programming, extensive local sports coverage, and community presence. According to Comscore, in over 76% of our markets in which we produce local newscasts, we rank among the top two stations in local news viewership. We employ a high-quality local sales force in each of our markets to increase revenue from local advertisers by capitalizing on our investment in local programming and community websites. In addition, we own or provide services to more than one station in markets to enable us to broaden our audience share, enhance our revenue share and achieve significant operating efficiencies. In even-numbered years, when most elections are held, we historically have generated substantial revenue from locally driven, political advertising. Given our diverse and expansive geographic reach, we have television stations in more than 80% of markets where there were contested political elections in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company earned approximately 67.5% of its core and political advertising revenue from non-Network programming.
Strong National Brands. We have a portfolio of scaled, strong national brands that enables us to engage with national advertisers in more meaningful ways than we have in the past. Our national brands include The CW Network, NewsNation, The Hill and BestReviews. The CW is America’s fifth national broadcast network. NewsNation is America’s fastest growing cable news network attracting top on-air talent to its ranks given its mission of delivering fact-based, unbiased journalism. The Hill is the nation’s leading, independent political digital media platform. BestReviews is a leading consumer product recommendations company.
 Diversified Revenue Streams. Our revenue streams are diversified by geography, affiliation and source. In 2022, we generated 49.3% of our revenue from distribution, 33.0% from core advertising (of which approximately 68% was from local sources), 9.7% from political advertising and 8.0% from digital advertising and other sources. No single customer generated more than 12% of our revenue; no single market generated more than 4% of our revenue and our affiliations are diverse with CBS, FOX, NBC, The CW, ABC, and MNTV affiliated stations, representing approximately 25.6%, 22.5%, 20.2%, 12.2%, 11.0% and 3.2%, respectively, of our 2022 combined core and political advertising net revenue.
Intense Operational Focus. We emphasize strict controls on operating and programming costs in order to increase EBITDA and free cash flow. We continually seek to identify and implement cost savings at each of our stations, the stations we provide services to and other business units, and our overall size benefits each station or business unit with respect to negotiating favorable terms with programming suppliers and other vendors. By leveraging our size and corporate management expertise, we are able to achieve economies of scale by providing programming, financial, sales and marketing support to our stations, the stations we provide services to and other business units. Our operational execution expertise is the direct result of our talented management team. We seek to attract and retain corporate, business unit and station general managers with proven track records by providing equity incentives.
 


Attractive Financial Profile.  Since 2020, we have grown our revenue each year, generated net cash from operating activities of $1.4 billion in 2022 and in excess of $1.2 billion in each of 2020 and 2021 and returned an increasing amount of that cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends in each year (in total: $382.9 million in 2020, $655.0 million in 2021 and $1.0 billion in 2022) while maintaining a corporate credit rating of Ba3 / BB as rated by Moody’s / S&P. We believe we have the financial flexibility to both invest in organic and inorganic growth initiatives while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.
 Growth Strategies
We continually seek to generate revenue, operating income, EBITDA and cash flow growth through the following strategies:
 Leverage Our Scale. We believe we are one of the largest affiliate groups for each of our major broadcast network partners. We are an important partner for the MVPDs and OVDs which include our content in their consumer offerings. Our digital assets attract an audience that makes us a top ten digital news and information property, according to Comscore. Our scale provides us with unique operating advantages in the form of services we can provide to our advertisers, audience and employees, a platform for growth and operating expense synergies and access to capital. As part of this strategy, in January 2023, we announced a newly created advertising sales structure and leadership team designed to drive advertising sales across our diversified media portfolio by further emphasizing our client-first approach, combined with a new data-driven, multi-platform focus.
Continue to Grow Distribution and Core and Political Advertising Revenues. We believe our core business of distribution and advertising revenue has the potential to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. We generated 49.3% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 from distribution fees paid to us by MVPDs and OVDs for retransmission of our content. We believe that the share of audience that our content generates for MVPDs and OVDs is greater than the share of fees those platforms pay us. In 2022, we renegotiated retransmission contracts representing over half of our subscriber base. We generated 33.0% of our revenue from core advertising and 9.7% from political advertising revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. According to SNL Kagan, local broadcast industry advertising revenue should continue to grow over the next ten years.
 Expand Digital Offerings.  For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, only 7.0% of our net revenue was generated from digital advertising. We are focused on better monetizing our digital content and audience and growing our portfolio of digital products, services and content and associated revenue streams. In 2022, we launched The Hill TV FAST channel, building upon The Hill’s success as an essential, agenda-setting read for lawmakers, policymakers and influential digital consumers. In 2021, we launched STELLAR, our unified digital platform that enables advertisers to increase customer acquisition and deliver effective omni-channel advertising campaigns.
 Operate and Expand National Broadcast and Cable Networks. We seek to continue to increase the viewership and revenues of our national television network assets, The CW and NewsNation.
 
The CW. We acquired The CW in September 2022 for no consideration. As the largest affiliate of The CW, we acquired the network to sustain and grow our CW-related revenue streams and to improve this underexploited national broadcast network asset. Our growth strategy for The CW is three-fold: First, we intend to improve and diversify the programming to align with audiences with the intention of improving ratings and revenue. To that end, in January 2023, we announced that The CW entered into an exclusive broadcast partnership with LIV Golf; Second, we are focused on accelerating digital growth via The CW App and cwtv.com by monetizing The CW Network’s content and a library of third-party content; and Third, we are actively reducing costs while focusing on execution. We believe there is potential for The CW to improve its profitability in line with other broadcast networks but also improve the profitability of Nexstar’s CW affiliates.
 
NewsNation. In 2020, we initiated the conversion of WGN America to NewsNation, a new cable news network, leveraging our core competency in news and profitable foundation to build a network focused on providing unbiased, fact-based news. Since then, NewsNation has emerged as America’s fastest growing cable news network and has been recognized by independent watchdog groups such as Ad Fontes Media, NewsGuard and AllSides, for its independent, unbiased reporting of national and local news. Currently, NewsNation provides 17 hours of news content each weekday which we expect to grow to 24 hours by the end of 2023 and to 24 hours, seven-days-a-week by 2024. We believe there is significant growth potential for NewsNation as news networks are among the most watched and profitable cable networks.
 Develop New Revenue Streams. We seek to generate new revenue streams leveraging the platform and assets of our company. Given our extensive station portfolio and geographic coverage, we are in the process of converting the technology used by our stations to a new standard, ATSC 3.0, which will enable us to provide new high speed data transmission services to businesses and consumers. Our goal is to increase our total ATSC 3.0 coverage of U.S. television households to approximately 50% from 35% as of December 31, 2022. We anticipate that this conversion will enable us to develop a new business and generate additional revenue in the future.
 

Acquire and Invest in New and Complementary Businesses. We selectively pursue acquisitions where we believe we can improve revenue, operating income, EBITDA and cash flow through active management. We selectively pursue acquisitions of businesses that leverage our platform, scale and capabilities and are complementary to our vision of providing local news, entertainment, and sports content through broadcast and digital platforms. In addition, we will continue to pursue television station acquisitions in markets where permitted by the current regulatory framework.
 
Relationship with VIEs
 Through various local service agreements, as of December 31, 2022, we provided sales, programming and other services to 35 full power television stations owned by consolidated VIEs and one full power television station owned by an unconsolidated VIE. As of December 31, 2022, all of the VIEs and their stations are 100% owned by independent third parties. In compliance with FCC regulations for all the parties, the VIEs maintain complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances, personnel and operations of their stations. However, for the consolidated VIEs, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests in these entities because of (i) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the consolidated VIEs’ stations, (ii) Nexstar’s (excluding The CW) guarantee of the obligations incurred under the senior secured credit facility of Mission Broadcasting, Inc. (“Mission”), a consolidated VIE, (iii) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting the consolidated VIEs’ economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, certain advertising sales and, in some cases, hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (iv) purchase options granted by each consolidated VIE which permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of all of the consolidated VIEs’ stations at any time, subject to FCC consent. These purchase options are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by the VIEs. These option agreements expire on various dates between 2023 and 2033. We expect to renew these option agreements upon expiration. Therefore, these VIEs are consolidated into these financial statements.
 For additional information on VIEs, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Industry Background
Commercial television broadcasting began in the United States on a regular basis in the 1940s. A limited number of channels are available for over-the-air broadcasting in any one geographic area and a license to operate a television station must be granted by the FCC. All television stations in the country are grouped by Nielsen, a national audience measuring service, into 210 generally recognized television markets, known as DMAs, that are ranked in size according to various metrics based upon actual or potential audience. Each DMA is an exclusive geographic area consisting of all counties in which the home-market commercial stations receive the greatest percentage of total viewing hours. Nielsen publishes data on estimated audiences for the television stations in each DMA on a quarterly basis. The estimates are expressed in terms of a “rating,” which is a station’s percentage of the total potential audience in the market, or a “share,” which is the station’s percentage of the audience actually watching television. A station’s rating in the market can be a factor in determining advertising rates.
Most television stations are affiliated with networks and receive a significant part of their programming, including prime-time hours, from networks. Whether or not a station is affiliated with one of the four major networks (CBS, FOX, NBC or ABC) has a significant impact on the composition of the station’s revenue, expenses and operations. Network programming is provided to the affiliate by the network in exchange for the payment to the network of affiliation fees and the network’s retention of a substantial majority of the advertising time during network programs. The network then sells this advertising time and retains the revenue. The affiliate retains the revenue from the remaining advertising time it sells during network programs and from advertising time it sells during non-network programs.
Broadcast television stations compete for advertising revenue primarily with other commercial broadcast television stations, MVPDs, OVDs, Alphabet Inc., Meta, TikTok, Snapchat and other online media, and newspapers and radio stations serving the same market. Non-commercial, religious and Spanish-language broadcasting stations in many markets also compete with commercial stations for viewers. In addition, the internet and other leisure activities may draw viewers away from commercial television stations.
Distribution
 We receive compensation from cable, satellite and other MVPDs and OVDs in return for our consent to the retransmission of the signals of our television stations and the carriage of NewsNation. Distribution revenues primarily represent payments from the MVPDs and OVDs and are typically based on the number of subscribers they have. Our successful negotiations with these distributors have created agreements that produce meaningful recurring revenue streams.
Advertising
 General
Our core television advertising revenue is derived from the sale of local and national advertising. For our stations, we sell, and retain all of the revenue from the sale of advertising time in our locally produced content and the portion of advertising time in network or syndicated content that is allocated to the station and not already sold by the network or syndicator. For our national broadcast and cable networks, we sell national advertising in the portion of advertising time we retain.
 Advertisers wishing to reach a national audience usually purchase time directly from the networks or advertise nationwide on a case-by-case basis. National advertisers who wish to reach a particular region or local audience often buy advertising time directly from local stations through national advertising sales representative firms. Local businesses purchase advertising time directly from the station’s local sales staff.
Advertising rates are based upon a number of factors, including:
•audience size and demographics of a station, network or program that an advertiser wishes to target; 
 •the number of advertisers competing for the available time; 
 •the availability of alternative advertising media; 
 •the effectiveness of the salesforce; 
 •development of projects, features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming; and 
 •the level of spending commitment made by the advertiser. 
 Advertising revenue is positively affected by a strong economy. Conversely, declines in advertising budgets of advertisers, particularly in recessionary periods, adversely affect the broadcast industry and, as a result, may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations.


In even-numbered years we generate substantial advertising revenue from the political advertising we sell to candidates, political action committees and political parties primarily through national advertising sales representation firms. Every four years, our political advertising revenues are positively affected by additional advertising related to the presidential election. The sale of political advertising is regulated by the FCC which establishes guidelines governing candidate and non-candidate rules regarding rate, content and amount of time that is sold.
Seasonality
Advertising revenue is positively affected by national and regional political election campaigns and certain events such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl. Advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during even-numbered years, when congressional and/or presidential elections occur and from advertising aired during the Olympic Games.
Advertising Sales
Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants. Compared to revenue from national advertising accounts, revenue from local advertising is generally more stable and more predictable. We seek to attract new advertisers to the television stations and their associated websites and to increase the amount of advertising time sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or co-promoting local events and activities. We place a strong emphasis on the experience of our local sales staffs and maintain an on-going training program for sales personnel.
National and political advertising time is sold through national sales representative firms which call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies, fast food franchisers and national retailers (some of which may also advertise locally).
Network Affiliations
All of the full power television stations that we own and operate, program or provide sales and other services to are currently affiliated with a network pursuant to an affiliation agreement, except for WGN-TV, WDVM and KAUT. The agreements with CBS, FOX, NBC, ABC, and The CW are the most significant to our operations. The current terms of these agreements expire as discussed below:

NetworkAffiliations | Expiration Date (in order of expiration and number of agreements) 
FOX | Of the 42 agreements, 41 expire in August 2023 and one(1) expires in December 2023.
The CW | 23 agreements expire in August 2023. 
MNTV | 18 agreements expire in September 2023. 
CBS | 49 agreements expire in June 2024. 
NBC | 35 agreements expire in December 2024. 
ABC | 29 agreements expire in December 2026. 

(1)This affiliation agreement is owned by a station to which we provide sales and other services. We do not consolidate this station in our financial statements due to lack of a deemed controlling financial interest.
 
Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the network with which it is affiliated. In exchange, the network receives affiliation fees from us and has the right to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect the network affiliation agreements listed above to be renewed upon expiration.
 


Investments
 We derive significant cash flows from our largest equity method investment, a 31.3% interest in TV Food Network, which operates two 24-hour television networks, Food Network and Cooking Channel, offering quality television, video, internet and mobile entertainment and information focusing on food and entertaining. During 2022, we received cash distributions from TV Food Network totaling $249.4 million. Our partner in TV Food Network is Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., which owns a 68.7% interest in TV Food Network and operates the networks on behalf of the partnership.
Competition
Competition in the television industry takes place on several levels: competition for audience, competition for programming and competition for advertising.
 Audience. We compete for audience based on program popularity. The popularity of our programming has a direct effect on the advertising rates we can charge our advertisers. We compete against other broadcast television programming, cable and satellite television programming as well as the plethora of direct-to-consumer programming provided via a variety of streaming services, including some of the broadcast television networks with which our stations are affiliated. Other sources of competition for audience include the internet, gaming devices, home entertainment systems, video-on-demand and pay-per-view.
 Specifically, The CW, our broadcast television network, competes with other broadcast networks and other distribution technologies for viewers and NewsNation, our growing national cable news network, competes with other established national news networks such as CNN, FOX News and MSNBC for viewers.
Programming. Our local television stations compete for syndicated programming from national program distributors or syndicators as well as compete to secure broadcast rights for regional and local sporting events. We compete against in-market broadcast station operators, cable networks and streaming services for exclusive access to this programming in our markets. In a different way, our local stations also compete with other stations in their markets to provide exclusive news stories and unique features such as investigative reporting and coverage of community events to their local audience. The CW competes against other broadcast television and cable networks as well as other video providers, such as direct-to-consumer streaming platforms for television content. NewsNation competes against other cable news networks for talent and stories.
Advertising. Our stations compete for advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and other advertising media such as online media (e.g., Alphabet Inc., Meta, etc.), OVDs, MVPDs, radio stations, newspapers, outdoor advertising, and direct mail, among others. Competition for advertising dollars in the broadcasting industry occurs primarily within individual markets. Generally, a television broadcast station in a particular market does not compete with stations in other market areas. The CW also competes for advertising revenue with other broadcast networks and other distribution technologies. NewsNation also competes for advertising revenue with other advertising media and with other established national networks such as CNN, FOX News and MSNBC.

The broadcasting industry is continually faced with technological change and innovation which increase the popularity of competing entertainment and communications media. Further advances in technology may increase competition for household audiences and advertisers. An increase in the popularity of OVDs may result in popular product offerings that do not include television broadcast stations or result in moving popular network programming to air concurrently or exclusively via OVDs. The increased use of digital technology by MVPDs, along with video compression techniques, will reduce the bandwidth required for television signal transmission. These technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems, including over-the-air broadcasting, and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to highly targeted audiences. Reductions in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels. We are unable to predict the effect that these or other technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or on the future results of our operations or the operations of the stations to which we provide services.



Federal Regulation
Television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The following is a brief discussion of certain (but not all) provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC’s regulations and policies that affect the business operations of television broadcast stations. Over the years, the U.S. Congress and the FCC have added, amended and deleted statutory and regulatory requirements to which station owners are subject. Some of these changes have a minimal business impact whereas others may significantly affect the business or operation of individual stations or the broadcast industry as a whole. For more information about the nature and extent of FCC regulation of television broadcast stations, refer to the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules, case precedent, public notices and policies.
License Grant and Renewal.  The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except under licenses issued by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. The FCC is required to grant an application for license renewal if during the preceding term the station served the public interest, the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules, and the licensee committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. A majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard. If a licensee fails to meet this standard the FCC may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate, including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight-year period.
 After a renewal application is filed, interested parties, including members of the public, may file petitions to deny the application, to which the licensee/renewal applicant is entitled to respond. After reviewing the pleadings, if the FCC determines that there is a substantial and material question of fact whether grant of the renewal application would serve the public interest, the FCC is required to hold a hearing on the issues presented. If, after the hearing, the FCC determines that the renewal applicant has met the renewal standard, the FCC will grant the renewal application. If the licensee/renewal applicant fails to meet the renewal standard or show that there are mitigating factors entitling it to renewal subject to appropriate sanctions, the FCC can deny the renewal application. In the vast majority of cases where a petition to deny is filed against a renewal application, the FCC ultimately grants the renewal without a hearing. No competing application for authority to operate a station and replace the incumbent licensee may be filed against a renewal application.
In addition to considering rule violations in connection with a license renewal application, the FCC may sanction a station licensee for failing to observe FCC rules and policies during the license term, including the imposition of a monetary forfeiture.
Under the Communications Act, the term of a broadcast license is automatically extended during the pendency of the FCC’s processing of a timely renewal application. We began filing license renewal applications for our stations in June 2020 and will continue these filings through April 2023.
 Station Transfer. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without prior FCC approval.
Foreign Ownership Restrictions. The Communications Act limits the extent of non-U.S. ownership of companies that own U.S. broadcast stations. Under this restriction, the holder of a U.S. broadcast license may have no more than 20% non-U.S. ownership (by vote and by equity). The Communications Act further prohibits more than 25% indirect foreign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company if the FCC determines the public interest will be served by enforcement of such restriction. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before indirect foreign ownership of a broadcast licensee may exceed 25%. The FCC will entertain and may authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing and favorable executive branch review, proposals to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees.

Multiple Ownership Restrictions. The FCC also has rules which establish limits on the ownership of television broadcast stations in local markets and nationally. These ownership limits apply to “attributable interests” in a station licensee held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other entity. In the case of corporations, officers, directors and voting stock interests of 5% or more (20% or more in the case of certain passive investors, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments) are considered attributable interests. For partnerships, all general partners and non-insulated limited partners are attributable. Limited liability companies are treated the same as partnerships. The FCC also considers attributable the holder of more than 33% of a licensee’s total assets (defined as total debt plus total equity), if that person or entity also provides over 15% of the station’s total weekly broadcast programming or has an attributable interest in another media entity in the same market which is subject to the FCC’s ownership rules. If a shareholder of Nexstar holds a voting stock interest of 5% or more (20% or more in the case of certain passive investors, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments), we must report that shareholder, its parent entities, and attributable individuals and entities of both, as attributable interest holders in Nexstar.
 

The FCC multiple ownership rules currently applicable to television broadcasters are summarized below:
 
Local Television Ownership (Duopoly) Rule. Under the current local television ownership, or “duopoly,” rule, a single entity is allowed to own or have attributable interests in two television stations in a DMA if (i) the two stations do not have overlapping service areas, or (ii) at least one of the two stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the DMA in terms of audience share (although the FCC may determine, on a case-by-case basis upon a sufficient showing, that the public interest would not be served by enforcing this “top four” prohibition). The duopoly rule also allows the FCC to consider waivers to permit the ownership of a second station, where otherwise prohibited, where the second station has failed or is failing or unbuilt.

In certain markets, the Company owns and operates both full-power and low-power television broadcast stations. The FCC’s rules and policies regarding ownership of television stations in the same market and nationally apply only to full-power television stations and not low-power television stations.

In a number of markets, the Company owns two stations in compliance with the duopoly rule. We also are permitted to own two or more stations in various other markets pursuant to an exemption under the FCC’s rules permitting common ownership of a “satellite” television station in a market where a licensee also owns the “primary” station. Additionally, we are permitted to own two stations in the Quad Cities, Illinois/Iowa, Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina-Asheville, North Carolina and Hartford-New Haven, Connecticut markets pursuant to waivers allowing ownership of a second station where that station is “failing.” We also own two “top four” stations in the Indianapolis, Indiana market pursuant to an FCC determination that prohibition of such ownership would not serve the public interest.
 
National Television Ownership Limit. The FCC’s rules limit the percentage of U.S. television households which a party may reach through its attributable interests in television stations to 39%. When calculating a party’s nationwide aggregate audience coverage, the ownership of a UHF station is counted as 50% of a market’s percentage of total national audience. In December 2017, the FCC initiated a proceeding to broadly reexamine its national television ownership rule, including the percentage reach cap and the so-called “UHF discount.” Comments and reply comments in this proceeding were filed in 2018, and the proceeding remains open.
 
The stations that Nexstar owns have a combined national audience reach of approximately 39% of all U.S. television households (applying the FCC’s UHF discount).
 
Attribution of Local Service Agreements. The FCC attributes the local television ownership limits toward another in-market station when one station owner programs that station pursuant to a TBA or LMA, if the programmer provides more than 15% of the second station’s weekly broadcast programming. However, LMAs entered into prior to November 5, 1996 are exempt attributable interests until the FCC determines otherwise. This “grandfathering,” when reviewed by the FCC, is subject to possible extension or termination. We provide more than 15% of a non-owned station’s programming under a TBA or LMA in six markets. In five of these markets—WFXP in Erie, Pennsylvania, KHMT in Billings, Montana, KFQX in Grand Junction, Colorado, KNVA in Austin, Texas and WNAC-TV in Providence, Rhode Island—the TBAs or LMAs were entered into prior to November 5, 1996 and are considered grandfathered. Therefore, we may continue to program these stations under the terms of these agreements until the FCC determines otherwise. Our LMA with Mission for WPIX in New York is not attributable because we do not own a station in that market and do not have any equity or debt interests in Mission.
 
Under current FCC rules, our JSAs and SSAs with independently owned same-market stations are non-attributable. We may therefore retain our existing JSAs and SSAs in effect and enter into new ones, but we must publicly disclose them, and the FCC may in the future consider regulations with respect to such agreements.

Quadrennial Review of Media Ownership Rules. The FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years and to eliminate those rules it finds are no longer “necessary in the public interest as a result of competition.” The FCC’s two most recent quadrennial reviews—those for 2010 and 2014—were eventually consolidated into a single proceeding that involved extensive litigation, an agency reconsideration and multiple court appeals, culminating in an April 1, 2021 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court which upheld the FCC’s elimination or relaxation of several rules. The 2018 quadrennial review, which the FCC commenced in December 2018, remains pending, and the FCC has solicited and received comments to update the record of that proceeding in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision. Additionally, notwithstanding the pendency of the 2018 review, in December 2022 the FCC opened its 2022 quadrennial review proceeding. Thus, the media ownership rules are subject to change as a result of current and future quadrennial reviews and in other proceedings.
 

MVPD Carriage of Local Television Signals. Broadcasters may obtain carriage of their stations’ signals on cable, satellite and other MVPDs through either mandatory carriage or through “retransmission consent.” Every three years all stations must formally elect either mandatory carriage (“must-carry” for cable distributors and “carry one-carry all” for satellite television providers) or retransmission consent. The next election must be made by October 1, 2023 and will be effective January 1, 2024. Must-carry elections require that the MVPD carry one station programming stream and related data in the station’s local market. However, MVPDs may decline a must-carry election in certain circumstances. MVPDs do not pay a fee to stations that elect mandatory carriage.
 
A broadcaster that elects retransmission consent waives its mandatory carriage rights, and the broadcaster and the MVPD must negotiate for carriage of the station’s signal. Negotiated terms may include channel position, service tier carriage, carriage of multiple program streams, compensation and other consideration. If a broadcaster elects to negotiate retransmission terms, it is possible that the broadcaster and the MVPD will not reach agreement and that the MVPD will not carry the station’s signal.
 
FCC rules and federal statutory law require retransmission consent negotiations to be conducted in “good faith.” It is a violation of the duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. Under this rule, stations may not (i) delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to another non-commonly owned station located in the same DMA or to a third-party that negotiates on behalf of another non-commonly owned station in the same DMA; or (ii) if located in the same DMA and not commonly owned, facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms between themselves, including through the sharing of information. Accordingly, the VIEs with which we have sharing agreements must separately negotiate their retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs for stations in markets where we also own a station.

MVPD operators have actively sought to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. There are still-open FCC proceedings to review the “totality of the circumstances” test for good faith retransmission consent negotiations, and to eliminate or modify the FCC’s non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules (which could permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations in certain circumstances).
 
The FCC’s rules also govern which local television signals a satellite subscriber may receive. The U.S. Congress and the FCC have also imposed certain requirements relating to satellite distribution of local television signals to “unserved” households that do not receive a useable signal from a local network-affiliated station and to cable and satellite carriage of out-of-market signals.

Certain OVDs have successfully or unsuccessfully sought to stream broadcast programming over the internet. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an OVD’s retransmissions of broadcast television signals without the consent of the broadcast station violate federal copyright law. In December 2014, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to interpret the term “MVPD” to encompass OVDs that make available for purchase multiple streams of video programming distributed at a prescheduled time and seeking comment on the effects of applying MVPD rules to such OVDs. The proceeding remains open. Although the FCC has not classified OVDs as MVPDs to date, a number of OVDs have signed agreements for retransmission of local stations within their markets, and others are actively seeking to negotiate such agreements.
 
The Company has elected to exercise retransmission consent rights for all of its stations where it has legal rights to do so. The Company has negotiated retransmission consent agreements with the majority of MVPDs serving its markets to carry the stations’ signals and, where permitted by its network affiliation agreements, will negotiate agreements with OVDs.



Human Capital Management
 Values. Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, develop, and retain top industry talent that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate and provide services. We encourage every individual’s contribution and personal growth and foster work environments that provide personal pride through job satisfaction and a balanced life. We embrace the communities in which we operate and promote open communications, innovation and creativity.
Engagement and Opportunities. With markets ranging from small to large to national, we offer a broad range of opportunities for every experience level, including for those who are just starting their broadcasting career or are ready to make the leap into a larger market or onto the national stage. Our market diversity allows us to give our employees room to grow and progress in their careers. Our management team supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce, enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions. As of December 31, 2022, our voluntary retention rate for employees was approximately 78%. We offer our employees a broad range of company-paid benefits and we believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry. Our employee wages are competitive and consistent with employee positions, experience, knowledge and location. In addition, in 2019, the Company initiated a company-wide minimum wage above the federal requirement, which increased effective January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2022. Annual wage increases and incentive payments are based on merit and are communicated to employees as a part of the annual review process. In January 2022, we also enhanced our parental leave and short-term disability programs, including the granting of up to six weeks of paid leave for eligible employees regardless of gender, offering birth mothers to take paid parental leave in addition to using short-term disability benefits and increasing the maximum weekly short-term disability benefit paid to employees by 100%.
 Community Outreach. At Nexstar, we pride ourselves on the opportunities we provide for our employees to give back to their communities. Since our 20th anniversary in June 2016 (with the exception of 2020), we have organized an annual Founder’s Day of Caring, an employee driven effort focused on local non-profits and charities. Across the country our employees take the day to contribute thousands of hours of community services. In 2022, our Founder’s Day initiatives provided nearly 17,000 hours of service in one day to the communities served by Nexstar TV stations.
 Diversity and Inclusion.  We strive to foster a culture of diversity and inclusion so all of our employees feel respected and none of them feels discriminated against. In 2020, we launched our Diversity and Inclusion Council, a working committee dedicated to creating a path toward a more diverse and inclusive workplace, where diverse talent can flourish and build a career. The Council is comprised of ten members from throughout the Company, with membership changing periodically. In 2020, the Council initiated our Employee Resource Groups and established a model mentorship program that were rolled out Company-wide. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. We believe a diverse workforce fosters innovation and cultivates an environment of unique perspectives. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 41% and 28% of our employees and our management (Vice Presidents and above), respectively, were women. In the U.S., approximately 26% and 12% of our employees and our management, respectively, were racially/ethnically diverse. This compares to approximately 40% of the U.S. population which is racially/ethnically diverse (source: 2020 United States Census Bureau population). In order to ensure accountability in making progress in our diversity goals, a portion of our managers’ bonuses are tied to diversity metrics in their markets. In addition, we have implemented Employee Resource Groups in the categories of Latinx, Women, African American, Veterans and LGBTQ+. These groups are designed to bring together employees who share similar cultures, backgrounds, and/or interests, as well as those employees who wish to provide support to that group.
Training and Mentorship. We are committed to developing the talents of our employees and provide our employees online workplace training. Our catalog of courses includes harassment prevention, diversity/equity/inclusion, ethics, managing bias, supervisor/manager skills, and COVID-19 safety. In addition, we have a mentorship program that matches mentors and mentees across the company and provides the pairs with a 12-topic curriculum covering skills such as communications, networking, work/life balance, and goal setting.
In 2018, Nexstar settled a U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division investigation, as did a number of other television broadcasting companies. Nexstar did not admit any wrongdoing but, as a part of the settlement agreement, it agreed to take certain actions, including providing training programs to all officers and sales related employees, to ensure they understand the antitrust laws, how those laws apply to Nexstar and our employees and to help them spot common patterns that may implicate antitrust laws.
Nexstar sales employees also participate in a media sales training program provided by The Center for Sales Strategy, a third-party vendor.
 


Safety and Health. We value our employees and are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace. All employees are required to comply with our safety rules and are expected to actively contribute to making our company a safer place to work. We have taken, and continue to take, robust actions to help protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees, to support our suppliers and local communities, and to continue to serve our customers. Employees must immediately report accidents, injuries, and unsafe equipment, practices or conditions to a supervisor or other designated person. The Company is committed to keep its workplaces free from hazards. Threats or acts of violence or physical intimidation are also prohibited, and will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
 Employees. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 12,971 employees, comprised of 11,666 full-time and 1,305 part-time employees. As of December 31, 2022, 1,829 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory, and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our facilities. However, we cannot assure you that our collective bargaining agreements will be renewed in the future, or that we will not experience a prolonged labor dispute, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are involved in litigation that arises from the ordinary operations of business, such as contractual or employment disputes or other general actions. In the event of an adverse outcome of these proceedings, we believe the resulting liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
