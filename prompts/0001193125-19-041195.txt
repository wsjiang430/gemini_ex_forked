 Mercer 
 General 
 Mercer Inc. is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Washington whose common stock is quoted and listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (MERC). 
 We have two reporting operating segments, being Pulp and Wood Products. 
 We are one of the worlds largest producers of market NBSK pulp, which is pulp that is sold on the open market. Our size provides us increased presence, better industry information in our markets and close customer relationships with many large pulp consumers. Until December 10, 2018, we operated two modern and highly efficient NBSK mills in Eastern Germany and one NBSK mill in Western Canada. 
 On December 10, 2018, we acquired all of the shares of Mercer Peace River Pulp Ltd. (formerly Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd.), referred to as MPR. MPR owns 100% of a bleached kraft pulp mill near Peace River, Alberta and has a 50% joint venture interest in the Cariboo Pulp & Paper Company, referred to as CPP, which owns the Cariboo NBSK mill in Quesnel, British Columbia. 
 
(3) 


 We are the sole NBSK producer, and the only significant market pulp producer in Germany, which is the largest pulp import market in Europe. We are able to supply the growing pulp demand in China both through our Canadian mills ready access to the Port of Vancouver and through our Stendal mills existing logistics arrangements. In addition, as a result of the significant investments made in cogeneration equipment, all of our mills generate and sell a significant amount of surplus green energy. We also produce and sell tall oil, a by-product of our production process, which is used as both a chemical additive and as a green energy source. 
 We entered the Wood Products segment in April 2017 when we acquired substantially all of the assets of the Friesau mill, one of Germanys largest sawmills. 
 As at December 31, 2018 and after giving effect to the acquisition of MPR, we have consolidated annual production capacity of approximately 2.2 million ADMTs of kraft pulp, 550 million board feet of lumber and approximately 411.5 MW of electricity. Of our pulp capacity, approximately 1.9 million ADMTs or 86% is NBSK and the balance is NBHK. 
 Key operating details for each of our mills are as follows: 
 

 | Rosenthal mill. Our Rosenthal mill is a modern, efficient ISO 9001, 14001 and 50001 certified NBSK pulp mill that has an annual production capacity of approximately 360,000 ADMTs and 57 MW of electrical generation. The Rosenthal mill generated and exported 157,977 MWh of electricity in 2018, resulting in approximately $17.1 million in revenues. The Rosenthal mill is located in the town of Rosenthal am Rennsteig, Germany, approximately 300 kilometers south of Berlin.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Stendal mill. Our Stendal mill is a state-of-the-art, single line, ISO 9001, 14001 and 50001 certified NBSK pulp mill that has an annual production capacity of approximately 660,000 ADMTs and 148 MW of electrical generation. The Stendal mill generated and exported 338,426 MWh of electricity in 2018, resulting in approximately $36.1 million in revenues. The Stendal mill is located near the town of Stendal, Germany, approximately 130 kilometers west of Berlin.

Our Celgar mill is a modern, efficient ISO 9001 and 14001 certified NBSK pulp mill that has an annual production capacity of approximately 520,000 ADMTs and 100 MW of electrical generation. The Celgar mill generated and exported 115,463 MWh of electricity in 2018, resulting in approximately $9.9 million in revenues. The Celgar mill is located near the city of Castlegar, British Columbia, Canada, approximately 600 kilometers east of Vancouver.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Peace River mill. Our Peace River mill is a modern ISO 14001 certified swing mill that produces both NBSK and NBHK pulp and has an annual production capacity of approximately 475,000 ADMTs and 65 MW of electrical generation. The Peace River mill generated and exported 3,316 MWh of electricity in 2018. The Peace River mill is located near the town of Peace River, Alberta, approximately 490 kilometers north of Edmonton. Through our Peace River mill, we have a 50% proportionate share of the annual production capacity of the Cariboo mill, which is approximately 170,000 ADMTs and 28.5 MW of electrical generation. The Cariboo mill is located in Quesnel, British Columbia, approximately 660 kilometers north of Vancouver. MPR also holds two 20-year renewable governmental forest management agreements and three deciduous timber allocations in Alberta with an aggregate allowable annual cut of approximately 2.4 million cubic meters of hardwood.

electrical generation from a modern biomass fueled cogeneration power plant built in 2009. The Friesau mill generated and exported 86,325 MWh of electricity in 2018, resulting in approximately $10.8 million in revenues. The Friesau mill is located approximately 16 kilometers west of our Rosenthal mill and has historically been one of the Rosenthal mills largest fiber suppliers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We currently employ approximately 2,210 people and have our headquarters in Vancouver, Canada. 
 Pulp Segment 
 Our pulp mills are some of the newest and most modern pulp mills in Europe and North America. We believe the relative age, production capacity and electrical generation capacity of our mills provide us with certain manufacturing cost and other advantages over many of our competitors. We believe our competitors older mills do not have the equipment or capacity to produce or sell surplus power or chemicals in a meaningful amount. In addition, since our mills are relatively new, they benefit from lower maintenance capital requirements and higher efficiency relative to many of our competitors mills. 
 The following table sets out our pulp production and pulp revenues for the periods indicated: 
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2018(1) | | 2017 | | | 2016
Pulp production (000 ADMTs) | | 1,472.6 | | | 1,507.0 | | | 1,428.4
Pulp sales (000 ADMTs) | | 1,440.9 | | | 1,515.1 | | | 1,428.7

----+-------------------------------------------------

 Our modern pulp mills generate electricity, which is surplus to their operating requirements, providing our mills with a stable revenue source unrelated to pulp prices. Additionally, our German pulp mills generate tall oil from black liquor, which is sold to third parties for use in numerous applications including bio-fuels. Since our energy and chemical production are by-products of our pulp production process, there are minimal incremental costs and our surplus energy and chemical sales are highly profitable. All of our mills generate and sell surplus energy to regional utilities or the regional electrical market. Our German mills benefit from special tariffs under Germanys Renewable Energy Sources Act, referred to as the Renewable Energy Act, which provides for premium pricing on green energy. Our recently acquired Peace River mill sells surplus energy to its regional electrical market. Each of our Celgar mill and the Cariboo mill is party to a fixed electricity purchase agreement with the regional public utility provider for the sale of surplus power through 2020 and 2022, respectively, and, in the case of the Cariboo mill, renewable at the option of the joint venture for an additional ten-year term. 
 The following table sets out the amount of surplus energy we produced and sold and revenues from the sale of such surplus energy and chemicals in our pulp segment for the periods indicated:

 Our strategic pulp mill locations position us well to serve customers in Europe, Asia and North America. We primarily work directly with customers to capitalize on our geographic diversity, coordinate sales and enhance customer relationships. We believe our ability to deliver high-quality pulp on a timely basis and our customer service make us a preferred supplier for many customers. 
 Wood Products Segment 
 We manufacture, sell and distribute lumber, electricity and other wood residuals at the Friesau mill which produces lumber for European, U.S. and other lumber export markets. 
 The Friesau mill also expanded our biomass energy profile and provides synergies relating to the sharing of wood and biomass fuel resources and the optimization of staffing and services with our Rosenthal mill. 
 The European and U.S. lumber markets are very different. In the European market, lumber is generally customized in terms of dimensions and finishing, whereas the U.S. market is driven primarily by demand from new housing starts and dimensions and finishing are generally standardized. 
 Additionally, lumber production and sales in Europe are commonly measured in cubic meters, whereas in the U.S. they are measured in thousand board feet or Mfbm. 
 The following table sets out our lumber production and revenues from April 12, 2017, being the date we acquired the Friesau mill, to December 31, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2018: 
 

 | December 31, | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
Lumber production (MMfbm) | | 398.7 | | | 281.3 
Lumber sales (MMfbm) | | 412.9 | | | 213.5 
Lumber revenues (in thousands) | $ | 168,663 | | $ | 82,176

 The Friesau mill generates electricity for minimal incremental costs, all of which is sold, providing a stable revenue source unrelated to lumber prices. The Friesau mills modern biomass fueled cogeneration power plant has an annual production capacity of approximately 13 MW of electricity. The plant sells electricity pursuant to a long-term fixed price green power tariff that runs to 2029. 
 The following table sets out the amount of surplus energy we produced and sold and revenues from the sale of surplus energy by our Friesau mill for the periods indicated.

----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We entered into the pulp business in 1994 when we acquired our Rosenthal mill. In 1999, we completed a major capital project to convert it to the production of kraft pulp. Subsequent capital investments and efficiency improvements reduced emissions and energy costs, increased the mills annual production capacity and enabled the production of tall oil. 
 In September 2004, we completed construction of the Stendal mill at a cost of approximately $1.1 billion, which was financed through a combination of government grants, long-term project debt and equity. Subsequent capital investments and efficiency improvements have increased the mills annual production capacity and its generation of green energy. We initially had a 63.6% interest in Stendal which increased over time through acquisitions and/or further investments until September 2014, when we acquired all of the economic interest in Stendal. 
 We expanded our pulp operations into Western Canada in February 2005 when we acquired the Celgar mill for $210.0 million plus defined working capital. Since its acquisition, we have effected several capital projects and other initiatives at the Celgar mill to increase its annual production capacity and its generation of green energy. 
 In April 2017, we entered into the wood products segment when we acquired the Friesau mill for $61.6 million in cash. 
 In October 2018, we acquired the Santanol Group, which operates Indian sandalwood plantations and an oil extractives plant in Australia, for $35.7 million in cash. 
 In December 2018, we significantly expanded our pulp business when we acquired MPR for approximately $344.6 million in cash.

 Corporate Strategy 
 Our corporate strategy is to expand our asset and earnings base through organic growth and acquisitions, primarily in Europe and North America. We pursue organic growth through active management and targeted capital expenditures to generate a high return by improving efficiency, reducing costs and increasing production of pulp, lumber, energy and by-products such as chemicals. We are also leveraging our fiber and process expertise to develop innovative new products based on other derivatives of the kraft pulping process and wood processing. We seek to acquire interests in companies and assets primarily in the forest products business and related wood extractive businesses where we can leverage our experience and expertise in adding value through a focused management approach. Key elements of our strategy include: 

 | Focus on Premium Grade Market Pulp. Our principal product is market NBSK pulp, which is a premium grade kraft pulp and generally obtains the highest price relative to other kraft pulps. Although demand is cyclical, between 2009 and 2018 overall worldwide demand for bleached softwood kraft market pulp grew at an average of approximately 2% per annum. We focus on customers that produce tissue, specialty papers and high-quality printing and writing paper grades. We believe the growth in demand from tissue and specialty paper customers, which utilize a significant proportion of NBSK pulp, has more than offset the secular decline in demand from printing and writing paper customers. This allows us to benefit from our long-term relationships with tissue and specialty paper manufacturers in Europe and participate in higher growth markets in emerging countries such as China where there has been strong growth in tissue demand. Since the acquisition of MPR, we also produce NBHK pulp, which we believe is now undergoing similar market dynamics as NBSK pulp.

 | Increasing Stable Revenues from Renewable Energy and Chemical Sales and Leveraging our Fiber and Process Expertise to Expand Growth. We focus on enhancing our generation and sales of surplus renewable energy and chemicals and, because there are minimal associated incremental costs, such sales are highly profitable. The acquisition of the Friesau mill has allowed us to expand into the German lumber market and grow our biomass energy profile. Sales of surplus renewable energy and chemicals provide us with a stable income source unrelated to cyclical changes in pulp and lumber prices. Additionally, we seek to capitalize on our fiber and process expertise to expand our commercialization and sales of new products and into new growth areas.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Targeted Capital Expenditures to Enhance Production Capacity and Efficiency. We currently operate four large modern pulp mills and the Friesau mill. These provide us with a platform to be an efficient and competitive producer of high-quality kraft pulp and lumber without the need for significant sustaining capital. We seek to make targeted capital expenditures to increase production and operational efficiency, reduce costs and increase electricity and chemical sales. Between 2014 and 2018, we invested approximately $183 million (including $7.6 million in associated government grants) in growth capital expenditures for capacity expansions, operational efficiencies and renewable energy and chemical production.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Achieving Operational Excellence. Operating our mills reliably and at a competitive cost is important for our financial performance. In addition to capital expenditures, we continuously strive to develop maintenance systems and procedures that will improve the throughput of our products by increasing the reliability of our manufacturing processes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(8) 


 
We also seek to reduce operating costs by better managing certain operating activities such as fiber procurement, sales, marketing and logistics activities. We believe that our continued focus on operational excellence should allow us to achieve improved profitability and cash flows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Strategic Opportunities. We believe there will be continuing change and consolidation in the forest products business, including pulp, lumber and related wood plantations and harvesting, processing and extractive businesses as industry participants continually seek to lower costs, refocus their product lines and react to ever changing global market conditions. We take an opportunistic approach to potential investments or acquisitions that can grow our business and expand our earnings.

The Pulp Industry 
 General 
 Pulp is used in the production of paper, tissues and paper-related products. Pulp is generally classified according to fiber type, the process used in its production and the degree to which it is bleached. Kraft pulp, a type of chemical pulp, is produced through a sulphate chemical process in which lignin, the component of wood which binds individual fibers, is dissolved in a chemical reaction. Chemically prepared pulp allows the woods fiber to retain its length and flexibility, resulting in stronger paper products. Kraft pulp can be bleached to increase its brightness. Softwood kraft pulp is noted for its strength, brightness and absorption properties and is used to produce a variety of products, including lightweight publication grades of paper, tissues and other paper-related products. 
 There are two main types of bleached kraft pulp, being softwood kraft made from coniferous trees and hardwood kraft made from deciduous trees. Softwood species generally have long, flexible fibers which add strength to paper while fibers from species of hardwood contain shorter fibers which lend bulk and opacity. 
 We primarily produce and sell NBSK pulp, which is a bleached kraft pulp manufactured using northern softwood and is considered a premium grade because of its strength. It generally obtains the highest price relative to other kraft pulps. 
 Prior to our recent acquisition of the Peace River mill, NBSK pulp was the sole pulp product of our mills. The Peace River mill is a swing mill as it produces both NBSK and NBHK pulp. Generally, approximately 37% of the Peace River mills production is NBSK and 63% is NBHK. The mill expands our product offering and its swing capabilities allow us to adjust our production mix to respond to market developments and take advantage of pricing differentials between NBSK and NBHK. 
 Most paper users of market kraft pulp use a mix of softwood and hardwood grades to optimize production and product qualities. In 2018, market kraft pulp consumption was approximately 56% hardwood bleached kraft and 41% softwood bleached kraft, with the remainder comprised of unbleached pulp. Over the last several years, production of hardwood pulp, based on fast growing plantation fiber primarily from Asia and South America, has increased much more rapidly than that of softwood grades, based on fiber that has longer growth cycles. Hardwood kraft generally has a cost advantage over softwood kraft as a result of lower fiber costs, higher wood yields and, for newer hardwood mills, economies of scale. As a result of this growth in supply and lower costs, kraft pulp customers have substituted some of the pulp content in their products to hardwood pulp. 
 
(9) 


 Counteracting customers ability to substitute lower priced hardwood pulp for NBSK pulp is the requirement for strength and formation characteristics in finished goods. Paper and tissue makers focus on larger paper machines with higher speeds and lower basis weights for certain papers which require the strength characteristics of softwood pulp. Additionally, where paper products are lightweight or specialized, like direct mail, magazine paper or premium tissue, or where strength or absorbency are important, softwood kraft forms a significant proportion of the fiber used. As a result, we believe that the ability of kraft pulp users to further substitute hardwood for softwood pulp is limited by such requirements. 
 Kraft pulp can be made in different grades, with varying technical specifications, for different end uses. Softwood kraft pulp is valued for its reinforcing role in mechanical printing papers and is sought after by producers of paper for the publishing industry, primarily for magazines and advertising materials. Softwood kraft pulp is also an important ingredient for tissue manufacturing and tissue demand tends to increase with living standards in developing countries. NBSK pulp produced for reinforcement fibers is considered the highest grade of kraft pulp and generally obtains the highest price. 
 Markets 
 We believe that over 140 million ADMTs of chemical pulp are converted annually into tissues, printing and writing papers, carton boards and other specialty grades of paper and paperboard around the world. We also believe that approximately 45% of this pulp is sold on the open market as market pulp, while the remainder is produced for internal purposes by integrated paper and paperboard manufacturers. 
 The pulp business is highly cyclical in nature and markets are characterized by periods of supply and demand imbalance, which in turn affect prices. Pulp markets are highly competitive and are sensitive to cyclical changes in the global economy, industry capacity and foreign exchange rates, all of which can have a significant influence on selling prices and our operating results. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time but generally reflect changes in macro-economic conditions and levels of industry capacity. Pulp is a commodity that is generally available from other producers. Because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition is generally based upon price, which is generally determined by supply relative to demand. 
 Between 2009 and 2018, worldwide demand for chemical market pulp grew at an average rate of approximately 2% annually, with worldwide demand for bleached softwood kraft market pulp having grown at an average of approximately 2% per annum.

 The following chart illustrates the global demand for chemical market pulp for the periods indicated: 
 Estimated Global Chemical Market Pulp Demand 
 

Over the last several years, macro-economic trends affecting worldwide NBSK pulp demand include: 
 

 | a significant increase in demand from emerging markets, and in particular China, which has more than offset declining and stagnating demand in the mature markets of Europe, North America and Japan; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a significant shift in demand by end use, as demand from tissue and specialty producers has increased markedly and offset the secular decline in demand for printing and writing paper resulting from the rapid growth in digital media.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Over the last ten years, demand for chemical softwood market pulp has grown in the emerging markets of Asia, particularly China and Eastern Europe. In China, imports of chemical softwood market pulp grew by approximately 6% per annum between 2009 and 2018. We believe the emerging markets now account for approximately 55% of total world demand for bleached softwood kraft market pulp and China itself now accounts for approximately 32% of global bleached softwood kraft market pulp demand compared to approximately 23% in 2009. Western Europe currently accounts for approximately 24% of global bleached softwood kraft market pulp demand compared to approximately 30% in 2009. 
 
(11) 


 The following chart sets forth industry-wide bleached softwood kraft deliveries to China for the periods indicated: 
 12 Month Rolling Bleached Softwood Kraft Pulp Deliveries to China 
 

Growth in NBSK pulp demand in China and other emerging markets has been primarily driven by increased demand from tissue and specialty paper producers, as a result of economic growth and rising income levels and living standards in such markets. These factors generally contribute to a greater demand for personal hygiene products in such regions. In China alone, tissue production capacity has increased by approximately 5.6 million ADMTs over the last five years. 
 This has also led to an overall shift in demand for NBSK pulp, as demand from tissue producers has increased, while demand from printing and writing end uses has decreased. 
 The following chart compares worldwide NBSK pulp demand by end use in each of 2003 and 2017 (the latest year for which figures are currently available): 
 NBSK Pulp Demand by End Use 
 


We believe 2018 NBSK demand by end use was generally consistent with the trend in the chart above. 
 
(12) 


 A measure of demand for kraft pulp is the ratio obtained by dividing the worldwide demand of kraft pulp by the worldwide capacity for the production of kraft pulp, or the demand/capacity ratio. An increase in this ratio generally occurs when there is an increase in global and regional levels of economic activity. An increase in this ratio also generally indicates greater demand as consumption increases, which often results in rising kraft pulp prices and a reduction of inventories by producers and buyers. As prices continue to rise, producers continue to run at higher operating rates. However, an adverse change in global and regional levels of economic activity generally negatively affects demand for kraft pulp, often leading buyers to reduce their purchases and rely on existing pulp inventories. As a result, producers run at lower operating rates by taking downtime to limit the build-up of their own inventories. The demand/capacity ratio for bleached softwood kraft pulp was approximately 89%, 93% and 92% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 Between 2013 and 2018, we believe approximately 0.5 million ADMTs of pulp capacity was idled or shut down through mill closures or curtailments. Further, in efforts to improve environmental and safety standards, China closed old mills and removed about 15.6 million ADMTs. 
 In 2018, chemical pulp capacity increased by approximately 0.9 million ADMTs, consisting entirely of softwood kraft pulp. Currently, we are not aware of any material announced capacity increases of NBSK or NBHK pulp in 2019. However, we cannot predict whether new capacity will be announced or may come online in the future. As pulp prices are highly cyclical, there can be no assurance that pulp prices will not decline in the future as a result of increases to the supply of kraft pulp. While not a direct competitor to NBSK pulp, if any future increases of NBHK supply are not absorbed by demand growth, such supply could put downward pressure on NBSK pulp prices. However, we believe customers ability to further substitute lower priced bleached hardwood kraft pulp for NBSK pulp is limited by the strength characteristic of NBSK pulp which is required by large modern paper machines to run lower basis-weight paper products efficiently. 
 In addition, certain integrated pulp and paper producers have the ability to discontinue paper production by idling their paper machines and selling their NBSK pulp production on the market, if market conditions, prices and trends warrant such actions. 
 NBSK Pulp Pricing 
 Kraft pulp is a globally traded commodity and prices are highly cyclical and volatile. Kraft pulp prices are generally quoted in dollars. Pricing is primarily influenced by the balance between supply and demand, as affected by global macro-economic conditions, changes in consumption and capacity, the level of customer and producer inventories and fluctuations in exchange rates. Generally, we and other producers consider global NBSK pulp supply and demand to be evenly balanced when world inventory levels are at about 30 days supply. 
 General macro-economic conditions are closely tied to overall global business activity, which helps determine pulp demand and, in turn, impacts pricing. 
 As the majority of market NBSK pulp is produced and sold by Canadian and Northern European producers, while the price of NBSK pulp is generally quoted in dollars, pricing is often affected by fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for the dollar versus the euro and the Canadian dollar. As NBSK pulp producers generally incur costs in their local currency, while pulp is quoted in dollars, a dollar strengthening generally benefits producers businesses and operating margins. Conversely, a weakening of the dollar versus the local currency of producers generally adversely affects producers businesses and operating margins.

 As a corollary to changes in exchange rates between the dollar and the euro and Canadian dollar, a stronger dollar generally increases costs to customers of NBSK pulp producers and results in downward pressure on prices. Conversely, a weakening dollar generally supports higher pulp pricing. However, there is invariably a time lag between changes in currency exchange rates and pulp prices. This lag can vary and is not predictable with any certainty. 
 As Northern Europe has historically been the worlds largest market and NBSK pulp is the premium grade, the European market NBSK price is generally used as a benchmark price by the industry. The average European list prices for NBSK pulp since 2009 have fluctuated between a low of approximately $575 per ADMT in 2009 and a high of $1,230 per ADMT in 2018. 
 The following chart sets out the changes in list prices for NBSK pulp in Europe, as stated in dollars, Canadian dollars and euros for the periods indicated:

 A producers net sales realizations are list prices, net of customer discounts, rebates and other selling concessions. Over the last three years, these have increased as producers compete for customers and sales. The nature of the pricing structure in Asia is different in that, while quoted list prices tend to be lower than Europe, customer discounts and rebates are much lower, resulting in net sales realizations that are generally similar to other markets.

 Pulp Price and Global Inventory History 
 

Seasonality 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors. These factors are common in the kraft pulp industry. We generally have weaker pulp demand in Europe during the summer holiday months and in China in the period relating to its lunar new year. We typically have a seasonal build-up in raw material inventories in the early winter months as our mills build up their fiber supply for the winter when there is reduced availability. 
 Competition 
 Pulp markets are large and highly competitive. Producers ranging from small independent manufacturers to large integrated companies produce pulp worldwide. Our pulp and customer services compete with similar products manufactured and distributed by others. While many factors influence our competitive position, particularly in weak economic times, a key factor is price. Other factors include service, quality and convenience of location. Some of our competitors are larger than we are in certain markets and have substantially greater financial resources. These resources may afford those competitors more purchasing power, increased financial flexibility, more capital resources for expansion and improvement and enable them to compete more effectively. Our key NBSK pulp competitors are principally located in Northern Europe and Canada and include Canfor Pulp, Stora Enso, Metsä Fibre, Ilim, Södra Cell and Asia Pulp and Paper.

 Softwood kraft pulp is valued for its reinforcing role in mechanical printing papers and is sought after by producers of paper for the publishing industry, primarily for magazines and advertising materials. Softwood kraft pulp is also an important ingredient for tissue manufacturing, and tissue demand tends to increase with living standards in developing countries. NBHK provides bulk and opacity for customers. 
 The NBSK pulp produced at the Rosenthal mill is a long-fibered softwood pulp produced by a sulphate cooking process and manufactured primarily from wood chips and pulp logs. The Rosenthal mill has the capability of producing both totally chlorine free and elemental chlorine free pulp. Totally chlorine free pulp is bleached to a high brightness using oxygen, ozone and hydrogen peroxide as bleaching agents, whereas elemental chlorine free pulp is produced by substituting chlorine dioxide for chlorine gas in the bleaching process. This substitution virtually eliminates complex chloro-organic compounds from the mills effluent. The Rosenthal mill produces pulp for reinforcement fibers to the specifications of certain of our customers. We believe that a number of our customers consider us their supplier of choice. 
 The NBSK pulp produced at the Stendal mill is of a slightly different grade than the pulp produced at the Rosenthal mill as the mix of softwood fiber used is slightly different. This results in a complementary product more suitable for different end uses. The Stendal mill is capable of producing both totally chlorine free and elemental chlorine free pulp. 
 The Celgar mill produces high-quality NBSK pulp that is made from a unique blend of slow growing/long-fiber Western Canadian tree species. It is used in the manufacture of high-quality paper and tissue products. We believe the Celgar mills pulp is known for its excellent product characteristics, including tensile strength, wet strength and brightness. The Celgar mill is a long-established supplier to paper and tissue producers in Asia. 
 The Peace River mill produces NBHK, NBSK and a small amount of transitional pulp, a lower grade pulp that is produced during the period when the mill transitions between NBSK and NBHK pulp. 
 Generation and Sales of Green Energy and Chemicals at Our Mills 
 Our pulp mills are large scale bio-refineries that, in addition to pulp, also produce surplus carbon neutral or green energy. As part of the pulp production process our mills generate green energy using carbon neutral bio-fuels such as black liquor and wood waste. Through the incineration of bio-fuels in the 
 
(16) 


  recovery and power boilers, our mills produce sufficient steam to cover all of our steam requirements and allow us to produce surplus electricity which we sell to third-party utilities and, in the case of the Peace River mill, into the regional electricity market. As a result, we have benefited from green energy legislation, incentives and commercialization that have developed over the last decade in Europe and Canada. In addition, in recent years we have applied considerable resources to increasing our capacity to produce and sell chemicals, primarily tall oil for use in numerous applications including bio-fuels.
Our Friesau mill also generates and sells green energy produced from its biomass cogeneration power plant. 
 Our surplus energy and chemical sales provide us with a stable revenue source unrelated to pulp or lumber prices. Since our energy and chemical production are by-products of our production processes, there are minimal incremental costs and our surplus energy and chemical sales are highly profitable. We believe that this revenue source gives our mills a competitive advantage over other older mills which do not have the equipment or capacity to produce and/or sell surplus power and/or chemicals in a meaningful amount. 
 The following table sets out our electricity generation and surplus electricity sales for the five years ended December 31, 2018:

German Pulp Mills and Friesau Mill 
 Our German pulp mills and the Friesau mill participate in a program established pursuant to the Renewable Energy Act, which requires that public electric utilities give priority to electricity produced from renewable energy sources by independent power producers and pay a fixed tariff for such electricity for a period of 20 years. Currently we expect such tariff to expire on December 31, 2020 for our Rosenthal mill, December 31, 2024 for our Stendal mill and in 2029 for the Friesau mill. Recent amendments to the Renewable Energy Act will extend the initial terms for our pulp mills for a further 10-year period, based upon the price received in the last year prior to renewal, regressing at a rate of 8% per annum. Such amendments are subject to compliance with European Union, referred to as the EU, state aid rules. While we expect them to be effective, we can provide no assurance that the current proposed amendments will be implemented or when. 
 In 2018, energy sales for our German pulp mills and the Friesau mill were $64.0 million or 582,728 MWh. 
 In 2018, our Rosenthal and Stendal mills generated $14.4 million from the sale of tall oil, a by-product of our production process, and other chemicals. 
 Canadian Pulp Mills 
 The Celgar mill has an electricity sales agreement with the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, referred to as B.C. Hydro, for the sale of power generated, pursuant to which the mill agreed to supply a minimum of approximately 238,000 MWh of surplus electrical energy annually to the utility over a ten-year term. The agreement expires in 2020. 
 
(18) 


 In 2018, our Celgar mill sold approximately 115,463 MWh of renewable electricity for proceeds of approximately $9.9 million. 
 The Peace River mill has an annual production capacity of approximately 65 MW of electrical generation. The mills surplus electricity is sold into the Alberta market. 
 The Cariboo mill has two generators, only one of which is used for pulp production. The other generator produces and sells electricity to B.C. Hydro at a fixed rate pursuant to a long-term electricity purchase agreement that runs until December 2022 and may be extended for an additional ten-year term at the option of the joint venture. 
 Cash Production Costs

Production Costs 
 Our major costs of pulp production are fiber, labor, chemicals and energy. Fiber, comprised of wood chips and pulp logs, is our most significant operating expense for our pulp segment, representing about 57% of our pulp cash production costs in 2018. 
 Further, fiber, in the form of sawlogs, represents about 80% of lumber cash production costs. 
 
(19) 


 Given the significance of fiber to our total operating expenses and our limited ability to control its cost compared with our other operating costs, volatility in fiber costs can materially affect our margins and results of operations. 
 Fiber 
 Our mills are situated in regions which generally provide a relatively stable supply of fiber. The fiber consumed by our pulp mills consists of wood chips produced by sawmills as a by-product of the sawmilling process and pulp logs. Wood chips are small pieces of wood used to make pulp and are either wood residuals from the sawmilling process or pulp logs chipped especially for this purpose. Pulp logs consist of lower quality logs not used in the production of lumber. The Friesau mill consumes sawlogs and waste wood, which are cyclical in both price and supply. 
 Generally, the cost of wood chips, pulp logs and sawlogs is primarily affected by the supply and demand for lumber. Additionally, regional factors such as harvesting levels and weather conditions can also have a material effect on the supply, demand and price for fiber. 
 In Germany, the price and supply of wood chips has been affected by increasing demand from alternative or renewable energy producers and government initiatives for carbon neutral energy. Declining energy prices, weaker economies or periodically warm winters tempered the demand for wood chips resulting from initiatives by European governments to promote the use of wood as a carbon neutral energy. There can be no assurance that such non-traditional demand for fiber will remain strong in the long-term. 
 During the past few years, certain customers have endeavored to purchase pulp that is produced using fiber that meets certain recognized wood certification requirements from forest certification agencies like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and the Canadian Standards Association (CSA). If the fiber we purchase does not meet certain wood certifications required by customers, it may make it more difficult or prevent us from selling our pulp to such customers. The chain of custody wood certification process is a voluntary process which allows a company to demonstrate that they use forest resources in accordance with strict principles and standards in the areas of sustainable forest management practices and environmental management. In an effort to procure wood only from sustainably managed sources, we employ an FSC Chain of Custody protocol for controlled wood and PEFC certification, which requires tracking of fiber origins and preparing risk based assessments regarding the region and operator. In the areas where we operate, we are actively engaged in the further development of certification processes. However, there is competition among private certification systems along with efforts by supporters to further these systems by having customers of forest products require products to be certified to their preferred system. Such wood certification standards continue to evolve and are not consistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction or how they are interpreted and applied. We currently do not expect certification requirements to have a material adverse impact on our fiber procurement and sales. However, if sufficient marketplace demand requires wood raw materials to be sourced from standards that are inconsistent with those in our fiber supply regions, it could increase our operating costs and available harvest levels. 
 Offsetting some of the increases in demand for wood fiber have been initiatives to increase harvest levels in Germany, particularly from small private forest owners. We believe that Germany has the highest availability of softwood forests in Europe suitable for harvesting and manufacturing. We believe private ownership of such forests is approximately 48%. Many of these forest ownership stakes are very small and have been harvested at rates much lower than their rate of growth. 
 In 2018, our per unit pulp fiber costs in Germany increased compared to 2017, primarily as a result of strong demand for wood in our German mills procurement areas. In 2017, our per unit pulp fiber costs in Germany were flat compared to 2016, primarily as a result of a balanced wood market in Germany. 
 
(20) 


 We believe we are the largest consumer of wood chips and pulp logs in Germany and often provide the best long-term economic outlet for the sale of wood chips in Eastern Germany. We coordinate the wood procurement activities for our German mills to reduce overall personnel and administrative costs, provide greater purchasing power and coordinate buying and trading activities. This coordination and integration of fiber flows also allows us to optimize transportation costs, and the species and fiber mix for both mills. In addition, in 2016, we entered into a joint wood purchasing arrangement with another significant wood consumer in Europe, being the Mondi Group. 
 In 2018, the Rosenthal mill consumed approximately 1.8 million cubic meters of fiber. Approximately 66% of such consumption was in the form of sawmill wood chips and approximately 34% was in the form of pulp logs. The wood chips for the Rosenthal mill are sourced from approximately 33 sawmills located primarily in the states of Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg and Thüringia and primarily within a 300 kilometer radius of the Rosenthal mill. Within this radius, the Rosenthal mill is the largest consumer of wood chips. Given its location and size, the Rosenthal mill is often the best economic outlet for the sale of wood chips in the area. In 2018, approximately 78% of the fiber consumed by the Rosenthal mill was spruce and the remainder was pine. While fiber costs and supply are subject to cyclical changes largely in the sawmill industry, we expect that we will be able to continue to obtain an adequate supply of fiber on reasonably satisfactory terms for the Rosenthal mill due to its location and our long-term relationships with suppliers. We have not historically experienced any significant fiber supply interruptions at the Rosenthal mill. 
 Wood chips for the Rosenthal mill are normally sourced from sawmills under one-year contracts with quarterly adjustments for market pricing. Substantially all of our chip supply is sourced from suppliers with which we have long-standing relationships. Pulp logs are sourced from the state forest agencies in Thüringia, Saxony and Bavaria and from private and municipal forest owners. In addition, the Rosenthal mill buys relevant volumes from traders and via imports from the Czech Republic and Poland. 
 In 2018, the Stendal mill consumed approximately 3.2 million cubic meters of fiber. Approximately 28% of such fiber was in the form of sawmill wood chips and approximately 72% was in the form of pulp logs. The core wood supply region for the Stendal mill includes most of the Northeastern and Western part of Germany primarily within an approximate 300 kilometer radius of the mill. We also purchase wood chips from Southwestern and Southern Germany as well as the Baltic Sea region. The fiber consumed by the Stendal mill consisted of approximately 61% pine, 38% spruce and 1% other species in 2018. The Stendal mill has sufficient chipping capacity to fully operate solely using pulp logs, if required. We source pulp logs from private forest holders, municipal forest owners and from state forest agencies in Saxony-Anhalt, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse, Brandenburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Rhineland-Palatinate and the City of Berlin. The volumes are distributed at optimal costs between the mills. In addition, over the last three years, the Stendal mill also imported fiber from Poland and the Baltic Sea region. 
 The availability of fiber for the Celgar mill is in large part influenced by the strength of the lumber market. Lumber markets are primarily driven by U.S. housing starts and, to a lesser degree, demand from China. 
 In 2018, our Celgar mills per unit fiber costs increased compared to 2017, due to strong demand from coastal pulp mills and limited pulp log availability. In 2017, our Celgar mills per unit fiber costs were flat compared to 2016, due to a balanced wood market in the Celgar mills fiber basket. 
 In 2018, the Celgar mill consumed approximately 2.4 million cubic meters of fiber. Approximately 69% of such fiber was in the form of sawmill wood chips and the remaining 31% came from pulp logs 
 
(21) 


  processed through its woodroom or chipped by a third-party. Celgars woodroom is able to process about 40% of the mills fiber needs. The source of fiber at the mill is characterized by a mixture of species (pine, douglas fir, hemlock, cedar and spruce) and the mill sources fiber from a number of Canadian and U.S. suppliers. 
 In 2018, the Celgar mill had access to approximately 24 different chip suppliers from Canada and the United States. Chips are purchased in Canada and the United States in accordance with chip purchase agreements. Generally, pricing is reviewed and adjusted periodically to reflect market prices. One of the longer-term contracts is a so-called evergreen agreement, where the contract remains in effect until one of the parties elects to terminate after providing the stipulated notice. All other contracts are generally for one year with quarterly adjustments or on three-month terms. 
 To secure the volume of pulp logs required by its woodroom and field chippers, the Celgar mill has entered into pulp log supply agreements, which can range from three-month to one-year terms, with a number of different suppliers, many of whom are also contract chip suppliers to the mill. All of the pulp log agreements can be terminated by either party for any reason, upon seven days written notice. The Celgar mill also bids on British Columbia timber sales from time to time. The Celgar mill has also commenced a pulp pricing and education process with certain licensees and contractors in most locales to increase harvesting of pulp logs that have traditionally been left as waste after harvesting operations. 
 MPR holds two 20-year renewable governmental forest management agreements and three deciduous timber allocations in Alberta with an aggregate allowable annual cut of approximately 2.4 million cubic meters of hardwood, of which it currently harvests approximately 44%, and 400,000 cubic meters of softwood, which it sells to sawmills surrounding the Peace River mill in exchange for wood chips. The forest management agreements were last renewed for a 20-year term expiring in 2029. 
 Approximately 85% of the Peace River mills hardwood fiber requirements are satisfied through MPRs forest management agreements and timber allocations with the remainder sourced from trees harvested from third-party owned timberlands. The supply of hardwood fiber at the Peace River mill is characterized by a mix of aspen and balsam poplar. Softwood fiber supply is from residual sawmill chips from local surrounding sawmills. 
 The Cariboo mill has a secure supply of high-quality residual wood chips primarily supplied by surrounding sawmills located at a short distance. The majority of the mills fiber is currently sourced from sawmills owned by MPRs joint venture partner. The supply of fiber is characterized by a mix of lodgepole pine, white spruce and interior douglas fir. 
 Our Friesau mill is dependent on the consistent supply of sawlog fiber. Wood fiber is the single largest input cost and accounts for about 80% of its cash costs of producing lumber. Our Friesau mill is located in an area where there is a significant amount of high-quality fiber within economic reach. The wood fiber requirements of the Friesau mill are met primarily through open market purchases and contract purchases from state forestry agencies and private timberland owners. 
 Labor 
 Our labor costs are generally steady, with small overall increases due to inflation in wages and health care costs. We have been able to largely offset such increases by increasing our efficiencies and production and streamlining operations; however, such costs increased in 2018 as a result of maintenance work at the mills. 
 
(22) 


 Energy 
 Our energy is primarily generated from renewable carbon neutral sources, such as black liquor and wood waste. Our mills produce all of our energy requirements and generate excess energy which we sell to third-party utilities and, in the case of the Peace River mill, into the Alberta market. In 2018, we generated 1,711,568 MWh and sold 701,507 MWh of surplus energy. See also  Generation and Sales of Green Energy and Chemicals at our Mills. We utilize fossil fuels, such as natural gas, primarily in our lime kilns and we use a limited amount for start-up and shut-down operations. Additionally, from time to time, mill process disruptions occur and we consume small quantities of purchased electricity and fossil fuels to maintain operations. As a result, all of our mills are subject to fluctuations in the prices for fossil fuels. 
Chemicals 
 Our pulp mills use certain chemicals which are generally available from several suppliers and sourcing is primarily based upon pricing and location. Overall, our chemical costs have remained generally stable over the last three years. However, such costs increased in 2018 as a result of maintenance work and other cost increases. 
 In connection with our focus on the growing bio-energy market, we sell tall oil, a by-product of our pulp production process which is used as both a chemical additive and as a green energy source. In 2018, we generated $14.9 million from the sale of tall oil and other chemicals.

 In 2018, our wood products segment revenues were: (i) 32% from Germany; (ii) 22% from other EU countries; (iii) 31% from the United States; and (iv) 15% from other countries. 
 Our global sales and marketing group is responsible for conducting all sales and marketing of the pulp produced at our mills and currently has approximately 15 employees. This group largely handles all European and North American sales directly. Sales to Asia are made directly or through commission agents overseen by our sales group. The global sales and marketing group handles sales to approximately 180 customers. We coordinate and integrate the sales and marketing activities of our German mills to realize on a number of synergies between them. These include reduced overall administrative and personnel costs and coordinated selling, marketing and transportation activities. We also coordinate pulp sales across our mills on a global basis, thereby providing our larger customers with seamless service across all major geographies. In marketing our pulp, we seek to establish long-term relationships by providing a competitively priced, high-quality, consistent product and excellent service. In accordance with customary practice, we maintain long-standing relationships with our customers, pursuant to which we periodically reach agreements on specific volumes and prices. 
 Our lumber sales are handled by our sales team in Germany and Vancouver. We also sell lumber through commissioned agents in certain markets. 
 Our pulp and lumber sales are on customary industry terms. At December 31, 2018, we had no material payment delinquencies. In 2018, one customer of our pulp segment through several of its operations accounted for 13% of our revenues. In 2017, one customer of our pulp segment through several 
 
(24) 


  of its operations accounted for 13% of our revenues. In 2016, two customers through several of their operations accounted for 19% and 10%, respectively, of our pulp sales. We do not believe our pulp sales are dependent upon the activities of any single customer and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our sales to tissue and specialty paper product manufacturers were approximately 54% of our pulp sales volume in 2018, 52% in 2017 and 50% in 2016. Generally, tissue producer customers are not as sensitive to cyclical declines in demand caused by downturns in economic activity. The balance of our sales was to other paper product manufacturers. 
 Transportation 
 We transport our pulp and lumber generally by truck, rail and ocean carriers through third-party carriers. We have a small fleet of trucks in Germany that deliver some of our German mills pulp. 
 Our German pulp mills are currently the only market kraft pulp producers in Germany, which is the largest import market for kraft pulp in Europe. We therefore have a competitive transportation cost advantage compared to Canadian and Northern European pulp producers when shipping to customers in Europe. Due to the location of our German mills, we are able to deliver pulp to many of our customers primarily by truck and rail. Most trucks that deliver goods into Eastern Germany generally do not have significant backhaul opportunities as the region is primarily an importer of goods. We are therefore frequently able to obtain relatively low backhaul freight rates for the delivery of our products to many of our customers. 
 Our Canadian mills pulp is transported to customers by truck, rail and ocean carrier to ensure timely delivery. The majority of our Canadian mills pulp for overseas markets is initially delivered primarily by rail to the Port of Vancouver for shipment overseas by ocean carrier. Based in Western Canada, our Canadian mills are well positioned to service Asian customers. The majority of our Canadian mills pulp for domestic markets is shipped by rail directly to the customer or to third-party warehouses in the United States. We also operate a logistics and reload center near Trail, British Columbia to provide us with additional warehouse space and greater transportation flexibility in terms of access to rail and trucking options. 
 The Friesau mills lumber is transported to customers by truck, rail and ocean carriers through third-party carriers. 
 In each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, outbound transportation costs comprised approximately 9%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our total consolidated cost of sales. Generally, in recent years, our transportation costs have been stable despite growing overseas shipments due to higher shipping capacity and we have also taken initiatives to target sales to the most freight logical customers. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We have continued to make capital investments designed to increase pulp, green energy and chemical production, reduce costs and improve efficiency and environmental performance at our pulp mills. The improvements made over the years have increased the competitive position of our pulp segment. Since its acquisition, we have also made capital investments to optimize sawmill production at the Friesau mill.

----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Capital investments at the Rosenthal mill in 2018 primarily related to new chip screens to improve the consistency of chips for the mills digester, bleach plant improvements and other projects. In 2017, they related to the purchase of additional land for raw material storage and a railcar acceptance system for logs and, in 2016, they related to a railcar acceptance system for logs and a lime kiln retrofit. 
 Capital investments at the Stendal mill in 2018 primarily related to wastewater improvement projects including the extension of the effluent treatment plant and other projects. In 2017, they included a project to reduce nitrogen in wastewater and smaller projects and in 2016 they related to a wastewater reduction project consisting of an evaporation plant upgrade and a project to reduce chloride levels in the process water. 
 In June 2018, we commenced a Phase II expansion and optimization project at the Friesau mill, which is designed to, among other things, increase annual lumber production to approximately 750 million board feet and improve production grade capabilities and efficiencies. We currently expect to substantially complete the project in 2020. 
 Certain of our capital investment programs in Germany were partially financed through government grants made available by German federal and state governments. Under legislation adopted by the federal and certain state governments of Germany, government grants are provided to qualifying businesses operating in Eastern Germany to finance capital investments. The grants are made to encourage investment and job creation. 
 The following table sets out, as at the dates indicated, the effect of government grants on the recorded value of such assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets:

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Qualifying capital investments at industrial facilities in Germany that reduce effluent discharges offset wastewater fees that would otherwise be required to be paid. For more information about our environmental capital expenditures, see  Environmental. 
 In 2018, capital investments at the Celgar mill primarily related to improvements to its digester and large maintenance projects. In 2017, capital investments at the Celgar mill included a pre-bleach press system upgrade and large maintenance projects. In 2016, they included new wood harvesting equipment, a logistics and reload center and other maintenance projects. 
 In 2019, excluding amounts being financed through government grants and expected insurance proceeds, we expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million to $150 million. 
 In our pulp segment, excluding our Peace River mill, we currently expect our capital expenditures in 2019 to be principally comprised of approximately $90 million for large maintenance projects, improvements to the Celgar mills bale line and other capital improvements at our mills. At the Peace River mill we will be undertaking significant maintenance to the boiler that will be funded by insurance proceeds. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  General. 
 In our wood products segment, we currently expect capital expenditures in 2019 at our Friesau mill, principally comprised of approximately $50 million for further upgrades to our planer mill and large sawline and other capital improvements. 
 Innovation 
 We utilize our expertise with wood, its processing and by-products to expand our product mix. As a result, we seek to develop new products based on derivatives of the kraft pulping process and wood processing. Currently these processes are focused on: 

 | the further refinement of materials contained in black liquor, the extractive chemical and lignin containing compounds that are a result of the kraft pulping process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the further refinement of cellulose materials that are currently the basis of pulp; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | higher use products that may be derived from wood processing and harvesting including oils from sandalwood trees.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are working on some of these initiatives on our own and with others in conjunction with industry associations or joint venture partners. One of the better-developed of these projects is a process to unbind the individual filaments that make up a cellulose fiber. The filaments resulting from this patented 
 
(27) 


  process have unique strength characteristics similar to other chemical derivatives, such as aramids. We are working to create commercial applications therefor, including as strength enhancers, solution stabilizers and specialty solutions for other products and applications. 
 Through an industry association, we are developing a proven manufacturing process able to supply commercial quantities of cellulose filaments. We, along with other member companies, including certain other pulp producers, have license rights to further develop and market existing intellectual property registered under patent to our industry association. We expect to expend resources to further develop this technology, both individually and in joint development arrangements with third parties. We currently estimate expenditures totaling approximately $1 million in 2019. 
 Such research and development of various end use applications are at different levels of development and, to date, there has been no commercialization of any products. There can be no assurance that such research and development will ever result in commercialization or the production or sales of any products by us at a profit or at all. 
 We are also researching potential higher use products that may be derived from processing different species of trees. In particular, we recently acquired the Santanol Group which harvests and processes sandalwood trees in Australia. We will be processing these trees for the production of sandalwood oil. This product is valued by the fragrance and essential oil industries for its scent and health benefits. 
 Environmental 
 Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations, dealing primarily with: 
 

 | air, water and land;
--+---------------------


 | solid and hazardous waste management;
--+--------------------------------------


 | waste disposal;
--+----------------


 | remediation and contaminated sites; and
--+----------------------------------------


 | chemical usage.
--+----------------

 Compliance with these laws and regulations generally involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs. We cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws and regulations or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed, have not become final or definitive or may be amended in the future. In addition, it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects. 
 We devote significant management and financial resources to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. In particular, the operation of our plants is subject to permits, authorizations and approvals and we have to comply with prescribed emission limits. Compliance with these requirements is monitored by local authorities and non-compliance may result in administrative orders, fines or closures of the non-compliant mill. Our total capital expenditures on environmental projects at our mills were approximately $20.6 million in 2018, approximately $4.6 million in 2017 and approximately $2.9 million in 2016. In 2019, capital expenditures for environmental projects, principally comprised of projects to improve wastewater quality, are expected to be approximately $6.0 million. 
 Environmental compliance is a priority for our operations. To ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations, we regularly monitor emissions at our mills and periodically perform 
 
(28) 


  environmental audits of operational sites and procedures both with our internal personnel and outside consultants. These audits identify opportunities for improvement and allow us to take proactive measures at the mills as considered appropriate. 
 We believe we have obtained all required environmental permits, authorizations and approvals for our operations. We believe our operations are currently in material compliance with the requirements of all applicable environmental laws and regulations and our respective operating permits. 
 Under German state environmental rules relating to effluent discharges, industrial users are required to pay wastewater fees based upon the amount of their effluent discharge. These rules also provide that an industrial user which undertakes environmental capital expenditures and lowers certain effluent discharges to prescribed levels may offset the amount of these expenditures against the wastewater fees that they would otherwise be required to pay. We expect capital investment programs and other environmental initiatives at our German mills will continue to offset the wastewater fees that are payable and we believe they will ensure that our operations continue in substantial compliance with prescribed standards. 
 In Canada, in addition to existing provincial air quality regulations, the federal government has proposed an air quality management system, referred to as AQMS, as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in Canada. The federal proposed AQMS includes: 
 

 | ambient air quality standards for outdoor air quality management across the country;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a framework for air zone air management within provinces and territories that targets specific sources of air emissions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | regional airsheds that facilitate coordinated action across borders;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | industrial sector-based emission requirements that set a national base level of performance for major industries in Canada; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | improved intergovernmental collaboration to reduce emissions from the transportation sector.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2016, Environment Canada released the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. The framework put in place a national, sector-based greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries. In addition, the provincial governments of Alberta and British Columbia: 
 

 | have greenhouse gas reporting requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | are working on reduction strategies; and
--+-----------------------------------------


 | together with the Canadian federal government, are considering new or revised emission standards.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, British Columbia has adopted a carbon tax and Alberta has a mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction regulation. 
 We believe that these air emission measures in Germany and Canada have not had, and in 2019 will not have, a significant effect on our operations. Although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future, we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations. We also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations. 
 
(29) 


 Future regulations or permits may place lower limits on allowable types of emissions, including air, water, waste and hazardous materials, and may increase the financial consequences of maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations or conducting remediation. Our ongoing monitoring and policies have enabled us to develop and implement effective measures to maintain emissions in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations to date in a cost-effective manner. However, there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future. 
 Climate Change 
 Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions due to natural and man-made causes have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, hail storms, wildfires and wind, snow and ice storms. Such changes and resulting conditions can adversely affect our operations, including variations in the cost and availability of raw materials, such as fiber, unplanned downtime, operating rates and transportation and logistics. As there are differing scientific studies relating to the severity, extent and speed at which climate change is occurring, we cannot identify and predict all of the consequences of climate change on our business and operations. 
 The effects and perceived effects of climate change and social and governmental responses have created both opportunities and negative consequences for our business. 
 The focus on climate change has generated a substantial increase in demand and in legislative requirements for carbon neutral or green energy. Pulp mills consume wood residuals, being wood chips and pulp logs, as the base raw material for their production process. Wood chips are residuals left over from lumber production and pulp logs are generally lower quality logs left over from logging that are unsuitable for the production of lumber. Sawmills consume sawlogs and residuals like wood chips that are generally sold to other industrial consumers like pulp and pellet producers. 
 As part of their production process, our pulp mills take wood residuals and process them through a digester where cellulose is separated from the wood to be used in pulp production and the remaining residuals, called black liquor, are used for green energy production. As a result of their use of wood residuals and because our mills generate combined heat and power in a process known as cogeneration, they are efficient producers of energy. Our Friesau mill utilizes residual bark and shavings from consumed logs to produce energy. This energy is carbon neutral and produced from a renewable source. Our relatively modern mills generate a substantial amount of energy that is surplus to their operational requirements. 
 These factors, along with governmental initiatives in respect of renewable or green energy legislation, have provided business opportunities for us to enhance our generation and sales of green energy to regional utilities. 
 We are constantly exploring other initiatives to enhance our generation and sales of surplus green energy and chemical by-products. Other potential opportunities that may result from climate change include: 
 

 | the expansion of softwood forests and increased growth rates for such forests;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | more intensive forestry practices and timber salvaging versus harvesting standing timber;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | greater demand for sustainable energy and cellulosic biomass fuels; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | additional governmental incentives and/or legislative requirements to enhance biomass energy production.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(30) 


 At this time, we cannot predict which, if any, of these potential opportunities will be realized by us or their economic effect on our business. 
 While not all of the specific consequences to our business from climate change are predictable, the most visible adverse consequence to date is that the focus on renewable energy has created greater demand and competition for wood residuals or fiber from renewable energy producers like the pellet industry in Germany. 
 In Germany, the price and supply of wood residuals have been affected by an increasing demand from alternative or renewable energy producers and governmental initiatives for carbon neutral energy. Declining energy prices, weaker economies or warm winters temper the demand for wood chips resulting from initiatives by European governments to promote the use of wood as a carbon neutral energy. There can be no assurance that such non-traditional demand for fiber will remain strong in the long-term. Additionally, the growing interest and focus in British Columbia for renewable green energy has created additional competition for such fiber. Such additional demand for wood residuals may increase the competition and prices for wood residuals over time. 
 In response to climate change risks, there have been governmental initiatives and legislation on the international, national, state and local levels. Such governmental action or legislation can have an important effect on the demand and prices for fiber. As governments pursue green energy initiatives, they risk creating incentives and demand for wood residuals from renewable energy producers that cannibalizes or adversely affects traditional users, such as lumber and pulp and paper producers. We are continually engaged in dialogue with governments to educate and try to ensure potential initiatives recognize the traditional and continuing role of our mills in the overall usage of forestry resources and the economies of local communities. 
 Other potential negative consequences from climate change that over time may affect our business include: 
 

 | a greater susceptibility of northern forests to disease, fire and insect infestation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the disruption of transportation systems and power supply lines due to more severe storms;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the loss of fresh water transportation for logs and pulp due to lower water levels;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | decreases in the quantity and quality of processed water for our mill operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the loss of northern forests in areas in sufficient proximity to our mills to competitively acquire fiber; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | lower harvest levels decreasing the supply of harvestable timber and, as a consequence, wood residuals.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human Resources 
 We currently employ approximately 2,210 people, of which approximately 1,395 employees work in our German operations and approximately 780 employees work in our Canadian operations. 
 Our pulp mills employ approximately 1,790 people, the majority of whom are bound by collective agreements. The Friesau mill employs approximately 340 people, the majority of whom are bound by a collective agreement. 
 
(31) 


 We consider the relationships with our employees to be good. Although no assurance can be provided, we have not had any significant work stoppages at any of our operations and we would therefore expect to enter into new labor agreements with our workers when the current labor agreements expire without any significant work stoppages. 
 Our senior managers and directors have extensive experience in the pulp, lumber and forestry industries, along with experienced managers at all of our mills. Our management has a proven track record of implementing new initiatives and capital projects in order to reduce costs throughout our operations as well as identifying and harnessing new revenue opportunities. 
 Wood Products Industry 
 General 
 With approximately 3.7 billion cubic meters, Germany has the largest timber reserves in Europe. The principal trees are spruce, pine, beech and oak. Approximately 70 to 80 million cubic meters are harvested annually. Many of the German forest areas have been certified according to PEFC or FSC standards. Modern solid wood products include sawn and planed lumber which are used in different areas. 
 Demand for softwood lumber is cyclical and influenced by transportation costs, exchange rates, government tariffs and competitiveness of substitute products, as well as factors that affect consumer confidence and drive demand for residential construction, such as interest rates, disposable income, unemployment rates, perceived job security and other indicators of general economic conditions. Demand can vary from region to region within a country and seasonal factors that determine optimal building conditions can also affect demand. 
 Lumber Products and Markets 
 Our Friesau mill, which was built in 1992 and has two high-volume Linck sawlines, has the ability to produce both rough and planed products. The sawmill principally manufactures finished sawn lumber milled from spruce and pine, including European metric and specialty lumber, U.S. dimensional lumber and J-grade lumber, in various sizes and grades. 
 The process for manufacturing lumber results in a significant percentage of each sawlog ending up as by-products or residuals such as wood chips, trim blocks, sawdust shavings and bark. By-products are typically sold to a wide variety of customers. In addition, we utilize a significant portion of the chips from the Friesau mill at our Rosenthal pulp mill. 
 The main markets for our lumber products are in Europe, the United States and the Far East. 
 Our Friesau mill fosters a diverse customer base in each of its key markets. Customers include national and regional distributors, large construction firms, secondary manufacturers, retail yards and home centers. 
 Competition 
 The markets for our lumber products are highly competitive on a global basis and producers compete generally on price, quality and service. Factors influencing our competitive position include, among others, the availability, quality and cost of raw materials, including fiber, energy and labor and the efficiency and productivity of the Friesau mill in relation to its competitors. The Friesau mill competes in international markets subject to currency fluctuations and global business conditions. 
 
(32) 


 Our Friesau mill competes against many producers, a number of whom own and operate more mills than we do and numerous competitors have greater financial resources or lower production costs than us.
