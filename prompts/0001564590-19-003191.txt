Item 1. Business 
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system, or CNS, disorders, where there are no approved therapies or existing therapies are inadequate. We have a portfolio of product candidates with a current focus on modulating two critical CNS receptor systems, GABA and NMDA.  The GABA receptor family, which is recognized as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, mediates downstream neurologic and bodily function via activation of GABAA receptors. The NMDA-type receptors of the glutamate receptor system are a major excitatory receptor system in the CNS. Dysfunction in these systems is implicated in a broad range of CNS disorders. We are targeting CNS indications where patient populations are easily identified, clinical endpoints are well-defined, and development pathways are feasible.
 Our lead product candidate is ZULRESSO™ (brexanolone) injection, a proprietary intravenous, or IV, formulation of brexanolone for which we have filed a new drug application, or NDA, with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, seeking approval to market and sell the product in the treatment of postpartum depression, or PPD.  Brexanolone is chemically identical to allopregnanolone, a naturally occurring neuroactive steroid that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors.  PPD is a common biological complication of childbirth, and is characterized by significant depressive symptoms that typically commence during the third trimester of pregnancy or in the months following childbirth.  Our NDA for ZULRESSO is currently under FDA review. On November 2, 2018, the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee, or PDAC, and Drug Safety and Risk Management, or DSaRM, Advisory Committee of the FDA jointly voted, by a vote of 17 to 1, that our data support a positive benefit/risk profile for ZULRESSO in the treatment of PPD when administered by qualified staff in a healthcare facility certified under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, program.  In November 2018, the FDA extended the previously disclosed December 19, 2018 Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target date for a decision on the NDA for ZULRESSO by a period of three months to March 19, 2019.  The launch of ZULRESSO in the U.S., if approved, will follow anticipated scheduling of brexanolone as a controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, which we expect to be completed 90 days after FDA approval. We anticipate that ZULRESSO, if approved, will launch in the U.S. in June 2019.
 Our next most advanced product candidate is SAGE-217, an oral compound that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for PPD and major depressive disorder, or MDD.  SAGE-217 is a novel neuroactive steroid that, like brexanolone, is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, targeting both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and Fast Track designation to SAGE-217 in the treatment of MDD.  We have completed two positive placebo-controlled pivotal clinical trials with SAGE-217, one in MDD completed in 2017 and one in PPD for which top-line results were reported in January 2019.  Our development plan for SAGE-217 is subject to ongoing discussions with the FDA.  The ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials for SAGE-217 in MDD are: a placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with MDD, known as the Mountain Study, in which we are studying two weeks of treatment with SAGE-217 followed by four weeks of follow-up, and an ongoing open-label retreatment study, known as the Shoreline Study, evaluating initial treatment with SAGE-217, treatment-free intervals, and as needed retreatment, in patients with MDD in which patients will be followed for up to a year after treatment.  Dosing in the Mountain Study commenced in December 2018, and we expect to report top-line results from this study in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020. 
 We plan to add an open-label extension trial to the Mountain Study under a separate protocol to continue to follow patients from the Mountain Study after completion for up to six months. As part of our Phase 3 clinical development program for SAGE-217 in depression, we also plan to initiate a placebo-controlled trial to evaluate fixed interval SAGE-217 monotherapy (treatment without traditional antidepressants) for up to a year, which we believe will help us meet the expected requirements for a potential NDA filing and inclusion of maintenance dosing as part of the label, if our development efforts are successful.  In addition, we are conducting a placebo-controlled polysomnography Phase 3 clinical trial of SAGE-217 in patients with MDD who have co-morbid 
 1

insomnia, known as the Rainforest Study.  We expect to report top-line results from the Rainforest Study and the Shoreline Study in 2020.
We are also exploring SAGE-217 in other indications, including bipolar depression and sleep disorders.  We expect to report topline results from a small open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-217 in bipolar depression in the first half of 2019.  
 In addition to SAGE-217, we have a portfolio of other novel compounds that target GABAA receptors.  SAGE-324 is a novel GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator with preclinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that suggest suitability for chronic oral dosing. We are considering developing SAGE-324 for a number of neurological conditions, including essential tremor and certain epileptiform disorders. Results from a recently completed Phase 1 single ascending dose clinical trial of SAGE-324 demonstrated that the profile of SAGE-324 includes good oral bioavailability and a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with once-daily dosing. SAGE-324 demonstrated clear target engagement in the brain using pharmaco-EEG (b-band power) as a functional biomarker. SAGE-324 was generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events and with a safety profile consistent with GABAA positive allosteric modulation. A Phase 1 multiple ascending dose clinical trial of SAGE-324 is ongoing. We also recently initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SAGE-324 in a small number of patients with essential tremor. We expect to report top-line results from the Phase 1 multiple ascending dose clinical trial and the Phase 1 essential tremor clinical trial of SAGE-324 in the second half of 2019. Our portfolio also includes SAGE-689, a novel GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator, with which we have conducted non-clinical studies to date, and other compounds at earlier stages of development with a focus on both acute and chronic CNS disorders. 
 Our second area of focus is the development of novel compounds that target the NMDA receptor. The first product candidate selected for development from this program is SAGE-718, an oxysterol-based positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor.  Our initial areas of exploration for potential development of SAGE-718 will be indications involving NMDA receptor hypofunction.  Indications involving NMDA receptor hypofunction include certain types, aspects or subpopulations of a number of diseases such as depression, Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and neuropathic pain. We completed a Phase 1 single ascending dose trial of SAGE-718 in 2017 and a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial in 2018. Results from these Phase 1 clinical trials of SAGE-718 demonstrated that the profile of SAGE-718 includes good oral bioavailability and a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with once-daily dosing. SAGE-718 was generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. We are continuing our SAGE-718 Phase 1 clinical program with target engagement biomarker studies in healthy volunteers, focused on electrophysiology and imaging, which are ongoing and for which we expect to report results in the first half of 2019. We also recently initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SAGE-718 in a small number of patients with early manifest Huntington’s disease. We expect to report top-line results from this trial in the second half of 2019.
 We expect to continue our focus on allosteric modulation of the GABAA and NMDA receptor systems in the brain. The GABAA and NMDA receptor systems are broadly accepted as impacting many psychiatric and neurological disorders, spanning disorders of mood, seizure, cognition, anxiety, sleep, pain, and movement, among others. We believe that we may have the opportunity to develop molecules from our internal portfolio with the goal of addressing a number of these disorders in the future. Our ability to identify and develop such novel CNS therapies is enabled by our proprietary chemistry platform that is centered, as a starting point, on knowledge of the chemical scaffolds of certain endogenous neuroactive steroids. We believe our knowledge of the chemistry and activity of allosteric modulators allows us to efficiently design molecules with different characteristics.  This diversity enables us to regulate important properties such as half-life, brain penetration and receptor pharmacology to develop product candidates that have the potential for better selectivity, increased tolerability, and fewer off-target side effects than either current CNS therapies or previous therapies that have failed in development.

Understanding the Foundations of Our Approach
 The CNS is composed of a vast and complex network of different structures and cell types, most of which serve, directly or indirectly, to provide a means for the nervous system to signal or communicate with other nerve cells to regulate brain function. The cell type responsible for this signaling is called a neuron. One way chemical or electrical signals exert their effects on neurons is by traveling across a physical gap located between two neurons, called a synapse. Presynaptic neurons transmit signals whereas postsynaptic neurons react to the signals. The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each having hundreds to tens of thousands of synapses to allow for this communication. This process is essential to all things, from organ function, to movement, to memory and all behavioral processes.  Neurotransmission is the process by which signaling molecules, called neurotransmitters, are released by a presynaptic neuron, travel over the synaptic space and bind to and interact with receptors on a postsynaptic neuron. Depending on the nature of the neurotransmitter and receptor, this interaction results in excitation, inhibition or modulation of the receiving neuron’s behavior.
 3

We are focused on developing drugs based on selective allosteric modulation of neurotransmitter receptors in the CNS. Allosteric modulators are a class of small molecules that interact at a site different from the site where neurotransmitters bind, and allow the potential for fine-tuning of neuronal signals. We believe that nowhere in the body is it more important to maintain normal rhythms than in the brain, and accordingly we believe that allosteric modulation approaches are well-suited for the treatment of CNS diseases and disorders.
 We utilize our proprietary chemistry capabilities to design and identify drugs that are allosteric modulators, and that have properties targeted to the indications of interest. Our goal is to select for development compounds that we believe are capable of varying degrees of desired activity rather than complete activation or inhibition of the receptor. Our current focus is on two critical CNS receptor systems: GABA and NMDA. The GABA receptor family, which is recognized as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, mediates downstream neurologic and bodily function in part via activation of GABAA receptors. GABAA receptors play a key role in regulating neuron excitability. The NMDA-type receptors of the glutamate receptor system are a major excitatory receptor system in the CNS. NMDA receptors serve a critical role in CNS-related activities. Dysfunction in these systems is implicated in a broad range of CNS disorders. 
 Our proprietary chemistry platform is centered, as a starting point, on our knowledge of the chemical scaffolds of endogenous neuroactive steroids that are allosteric modulators of GABAA or NMDA receptors. We have leveraged this platform to assemble a chemistry portfolio of greater than 5,000 compounds. We believe our proprietary chemistry platform allows us to:
  
• | control important properties such as half-life, brain penetration and the types of receptors our drugs act upon, thereby modulating either inhibition or excitation either acutely or chronically; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | create drugs that are designed to exert control over the intensity of receptor activation or deactivation, with the potential to hit targets in the brain with more precision, with the goal of increased tolerability and fewer off-target side effects than current CNS therapies or previous therapies that have failed in development.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We target CNS indications where patient populations are easily identified, clinical endpoints are well-defined, and development pathways are feasible.

Our Product Pipeline
 The following table summarizes the status of our development programs as of the filing date of this Annual Report. 
 

ZULRESSO (Brexanolone) Injection
 Overview
 Our lead product candidate, ZULRESSO (brexanolone) injection, is a proprietary IV formulation of brexanolone that we have developed for the treatment of PPD.  Brexanolone is chemically identical to allopregnanolone, a naturally occurring neuroactive steroid that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors.  The FDA is currently reviewing our NDA for this product candidate.  On November 2, 2018, the PDAC and DSaRM Advisory Committee of the FDA jointly voted, by a vote of 17 to 1, that our data support a positive benefit/risk profile for ZULRESSO in the treatment of PPD when administered by qualified staff in a healthcare facility certified under a REMS program.  The joint recommendations of the PDAC and the DSaRM Advisory Committee are not binding on the FDA. In November 2018, the FDA extended the previously disclosed PDUFA target date for a decision on the NDA for ZULRESSO by a period of three months to March 19, 2019.  The launch of ZULRESSO in the U.S., if approved, will follow anticipated scheduling of brexanolone as a controlled substance by the DEA, which we expect to be completed 90 days after FDA approval. We anticipate that ZULRESSO, if approved, will launch in the U.S. in June 2019.  We currently have sales, marketing, and market access teams in place in anticipation of a potential launch as well as a patient support team located in Raleigh, North Carolina.   If approved, administration of ZULRESSO will be limited to healthcare facilities that have been certified under a REMS program under the supervision of qualified staff to mitigate the potential for harm associated with the risk of excessive sedation and loss of consciousness during the ZULRESSO infusion. As part of the proposed REMS, patients who are prescribed ZULRESSO will be required to enroll in a patient registry to allow us to compile additional information to further our understanding of the risk of excessive sedation and 

loss of consciousness during administration and management of the risk.  Given the mode of administration, the nature of the REMS and the limitation on the administration of ZULRESSO to a healthcare facility setting certified under the REMS, we expect that use of ZULRESSO, if approved for marketing and sale in the U.S., will, at least initially, be focused primarily on women with more severe symptoms of PPD. We estimate that greater than 400,000 women in the U.S. experience PPD symptoms each year of whom approximately 50% are formally diagnosed. We estimate that about 20 to 30% of women diagnosed with PPD experience severe symptoms.
 5

We have received PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, designation from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the EU for our proprietary formulation of brexanolone as a potential treatment for PPD.  In October 2018, we received scientific advice from the EMA regarding the potential regulatory pathway for a marketing authorization application, or MAA, filing in the EU.  We anticipate having additional discussions with the EMA to help further clarify and evaluate what additional data and information would be needed, and what other requirements would need to be met, for a potential MAA filing.
 Postpartum Depression
 PPD is a common biological complication of childbirth, and is characterized by significant depressive symptoms that typically commence during the third trimester of pregnancy or within the months following childbirth.  PPD symptoms may include sadness and depressed mood; anxiety or agitation; loss of interest in daily activities; changes in eating and sleeping habits; feeling overwhelmed; fatigue and decreased energy; inability to concentrate; hypervigilance about the baby or lack of interest in the baby; and feelings of worthlessness, shame or guilt.  In the U.S., estimates of new mothers identified with PPD each year vary state-to-state from 8 to 20 percent, with an overall average of 11.5 percent.  Based on these data, we estimate that 400,000 or more women in the U.S. each year may experience PPD, and approximately 50% are formally diagnosed.  We estimate that 20 to 30% of women diagnosed with PPD will experience severe symptoms.  PPD can lead to devastating consequences for a woman and for her family.  Suicide is the leading cause of maternal death following childbirth. 
 There are no pharmacological therapies specifically approved for PPD.  Current standard of care for PPD is comprised of psychotherapy and, in women with moderate or severe PPD, the cautious use of pharmacological therapies such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs. 
 Naturally occurring allopregnanolone is found at its highest levels in women during the third trimester of pregnancy, returning to normal levels generally within 24 hours after giving birth.  Levels of allopregnanolone have been found to be lower in women with PPD than in healthy women.  It may be that women with PPD are particularly sensitive to the rapid decline in allopregnanolone after birth, potentially causing GABAA -system mediated mood disruption. Given these data, we believe that allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor may have potential in the treatment of PPD. 
 Clinical Trials of Brexanolone in PPD
 In November 2017, we announced positive top-line results from our Hummingbird Phase 3 clinical program studying our proprietary IV formulation of brexanolone in PPD.  The Hummingbird Phase 3 program was comprised of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of brexanolone in women with PPD.  One study (202B) evaluated women with severe PPD and the other study (202C) evaluated women with moderate PPD, in each case as defined by the study criteria. Entry criteria for participants included symptoms of PPD that began no earlier than the third trimester and no later than the first four weeks following delivery in women who were no more than six months post-partum at the time of screening. In November 2017, we announced that both trials, at all doses, achieved the primary endpoint, a statistically significant mean reduction from baseline in the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, or HAMD-17, total score at 60 hours in the brexanolone group compared to the placebo group (Study 202B: p=0.0252 for 90 µg/kg/h dose and p=0.0013 for 60 µg/kg/h dose; Study 202C: p=0.0160 for 90 µg/kg/h dose). 
 In Study 202B, 122 women with severe PPD, as measured by a HAMD-17 total score of 26 or above, prior to randomization were dosed in one of three treatment groups: brexanolone 90 µg/kg/hour, brexanolone 60 µg/kg/hour, or placebo, on a 1:1:1 basis. Brexanolone 90 µg/kg/hour treatment was associated with a statistically significant mean reduction in HAMD-17 total score of 17.7 points from baseline at 60 hours compared with a 14.0 point mean reduction in HAMD-17 total score associated with placebo (p=0.0252). Brexanolone 60 µg/kg/hour treatment was associated with a statistically significant mean reduction in HAMD-17 total score of 19.9 points from baseline at 60 hours compared with a 14.0 point mean reduction in HAMD-17 total score associated with placebo (p=0.0013). Reduction in HAMD-17 total score in the brexanolone group versus placebo were first observed at 48 hours, with statistical significance only in the 60 µg group, and the effect at 60 hours was maintained at the 30-day follow-up period with statistical significance for both brexanolone dose groups. Improvement in the Clinical Global Impression – Improvement, or CGI-I, scale at 60 hours was consistent with the primary endpoint (p=0.0095 for 90 µg/kg/h dose and p=0.0131 for 60 µg/kg/h dose).
 6

In Study 202C, 104 patients with moderate PPD, as measured by a HAMD-17 total score of 20 to 25, were dosed in one of two treatment groups (brexanolone 90 µg/kg/hour or placebo) on a 1:1 basis. Brexanolone treatment was associated with a statistically significant mean reduction in HAMD-17 total score of 14.2 points from baseline at 60 hours (p=0.016) compared with a 12.0 point mean reduction in HAMD-17 total score associated with placebo. Statistical significance was first observed at 48 hours and remained through Day 7, but was not observed at Day 30. However, the effect observed at 60 hours was maintained through the 30-day follow-up period. Improvement in the CGI-I scale at 60 hours was consistent with the primary endpoint (p=0.0005). 
 Brexanolone IV was generally well tolerated in both trials with similar rates of adverse events across all treatment groups.  The most common adverse reactions in the trials were sedation/somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, flushing and loss of consciousness.  Adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in 2% of patients and were sedation-related or related to infusion site pain. In the Hummingbird program, in patients treated with brexanolone, approximately 4% of patients experienced loss of consciousness and less that 1% experienced an altered state of consciousness during the infusion.  All of these patients recovered with dose interruption, and no further intervention was necessary. 
 The Phase 3 Hummingbird program was an extension of a Phase 2 clinical trial of brexanolone in PPD.  
Twenty-one patients were enrolled in the Phase 2 clinical trial. Patients were required to have had a major depressive episode that began no earlier than the third trimester and no later than the first four weeks following delivery, and also to be less than six months postpartum at the time of enrollment. Trial participants were also required to have a HAMD-17 score of 26 or above prior to treatment.  The trial achieved the primary endpoint of a significant reduction in the HAMD-17 in the brexanolone group compared to placebo at 60 hours (p=0.008). In the trial, there was a greater than 20 point mean reduction in the depression scores of the brexanolone group at 60 hours with a greater than 12 point difference from placebo. The statistically significant difference in treatment effect began at 24 hours (p=0.006) with an effect that was maintained at similar magnitude through to the 30-day follow-up period (p=0.01). Remission from depression, as determined by a HAMD-17 <7, measured at 60 hours, was seen in 7 of 10 of the brexanolone group compared with 1 of 11 in the placebo group. Similarly, at 30 days, 7 of 10 of the brexanolone IV group and 2 of 11 in the placebo group were in remission.  Brexanolone IV was found to be generally well-tolerated.  There were no deaths, serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events in the Phase 2 clinical trial.  The most common side effects in the brexanolone group of the Phase 2 clinical trial were dizziness and somnolence. 
 SAGE-217
 Overview
 Our next most advanced product candidate is SAGE-217, an oral compound that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development in PPD and MDD.  SAGE-217 is a novel neuroactive steroid that, like brexanolone, is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, targeting both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors.  We are also exploring SAGE-217 in other indications, including bipolar depression and sleep disorders.   
 Depression Program
 SAGE-217 is currently in Phase 3 clinical development as a treatment for the potentially debilitating mood disorders: MDD and PPD.  The FDA has granted SAGE-217 Breakthrough Therapy designation and Fast Track designation in the treatment of MDD.  
 MDD is a condition in which a patient experiences at least two weeks of a major depressive episode which causes significant distress or disability where the episode is not due to another medical condition or substance use and there is no history of mania or hypomania.  In typical depressive episodes, the person experiences depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and reduced energy leading to diminished activity for at least two weeks. Many people with depression also suffer from anxiety symptoms and medically unexplained somatic symptoms. A person with moderate or severe MDD will typically have difficulties carrying out his or her usual work, school, domestic or social activities due to symptoms of depression.  Antidepressants are widely used in the treatment of MDD, but many patients do not adequately respond to existing treatments.  According to estimates, approximately 16 million adults in the U.S. reported one major depressive episode in 2015.  Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest the role of GABAA receptor dysfunction in depression.  Low GABA and allopregnanolone levels have been found in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of depressed patients.  
 7

To date we have completed two pivotal clinical trials of SAGE-217, one in MDD and one in PPD.  In December 2017, we announced the top-line results of our double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-217 in MDD, which included 89 adult patients with moderate to severe MDD.  In the trial, treatment for 14 days with SAGE-217 was associated with a statistically significant mean reduction from baseline in the HAMD-17 total score at Day 15 (the time of the primary endpoint) of 17.6 points for the SAGE-217 group, compared to 10.7 for the placebo group (p<0.0001). Statistically significant mean improvements in the HAMD-17 score compared to placebo were observed by the morning following the first dose through Week 4, and the effects of SAGE-217 remained numerically greater than placebo through the end of follow-up at Week 6, but were not statistically significant compared to placebo at Week 6. At Day 15, 64 percent of patients who received SAGE-217 achieved remission, defined as a score of 7 or less on the HAMD-17 score, compared with 23 percent of patients who received placebo (p=0.0005).  SAGE-217 was generally well-tolerated in the trial with no serious adverse events.  The overall number of reports of adverse events was similar between drug (53%) and placebo (46%). A low rate of discontinuations due to adverse events was reported.  The most common adverse events in the SAGE-217 group were headache, dizziness, nausea, and somnolence. 
 The Phase 2 placebo-controlled trial of SAGE-217 in MDD was initiated following completion of an earlier open-label proof-of-concept clinical trial (Part A) evaluating SAGE-217 in 13 MDD patients.  The primary endpoint of Part A was to evaluate safety and tolerability. SAGE-217 was found to be generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events or discontinuations reported.  The most common adverse events were sedation/somnolence, headache, dizziness, and myalgia, or muscle pain.   The trial also examined the effect of SAGE-217 on the HAMD-17 total score, in addition to other secondary measures. Patients in the trial had a mean HAMD-17 total score of 27.2 at baseline.  Data demonstrated a mean reduction from baseline in the HAMD-17 score of 19.9 points at Day 15, with 85% (11 of 13) patients showing at least a 50% reduction of their HAMD-17 and 62% (8 of 13) of patients achieving remission, as determined by a HAMD-17 ≤7.  A statistically significant mean change from baseline was observed by Day 2 of the trial, following the first of once-daily, nighttime oral dosing of 30 mg of SAGE-217. A significant mean change from baseline was maintained throughout the treatment period (p<0.0001 at Day 15). 
 In January 2019, we announced the results of a piv
otal trial of SAGE-217 in PPD.  In this placebo-controlled clinical trial of 151 women with severe PPD, SAGE-217 had a statistically significant improvement of 17.8 points in the HAMD-17 score, compared to 13.6 for placebo (primary endpoint, p=0.0028), with statistically significant reductions in HAMD-17 compared to placebo maintained through the end of the four-week follow-up (-19.2 vs. -15.1; p=0.0027). Statistically significant differences in the reduction in HAMD-17 total score of SAGE-217 versus placebo were first observed on Day 3 (-12.5 vs. -9.8; p=0.0252) and the effect was maintained at each timepoint through two weeks of treatment (-17.8 vs. -13.6; p=0.0028), the primary endpoint of the study. The effect was maintained through the four-week follow-up.  Remission was achieved in 45% of patients treated with SAGE-217 for two weeks as measured by the HAMD-17 compared with 23% of patients receiving placebo (p=0.0110); at the end of the four-week follow-up, 53% of patients receiving SAGE-217 achieved remission compared with 30% of patients who received placebo (p=0.0091). After two weeks of treatment with SAGE-217, 72% of patients achieved a response (50% improvement from baseline HAMD-17 score) compared with 48% of patients who received placebo (p=0.0049); at the end of the four-week follow-up, 75% of patients receiving SAGE-217 achieved a response compared with 57% of patients who received placebo (p=0.0216).  Statistically significant differences in the reduction in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score for the SAGE-217 treatment group versus placebo were observed after two weeks of treatment (-22 vs. -18; p=0.0180) and the effect was maintained through the end of the four-week follow-up (-25 vs. -19; p=0.0018).  Other secondary endpoints, including the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Clinical Global Impression – Improvement (CGI-I) Scale, also showed statistically significant improvements in favor of SAGE-217 as compared to placebo. SAGE-217 was generally well-tolerated in the trial, with a safety profile consistent with that seen in earlier SAGE-217 trials. Overall reports of adverse events were similar between SAGE-217 (58%) and placebo (51%). Two subjects experienced serious adverse events, one subject in each group.  The most common adverse events in the SAGE-217 treatment group were: somnolence, headache, dizziness, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and sedation.

Our development plan for SAGE-217 is subject to ongoing discussions with the FDA. The ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials for SAGE-217 in MDD are: a placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with MDD, known as the Mountain Study, in which we are studying two weeks of treatment with SAGE-217 followed by four weeks of follow-up and an ongoing open-label retreatment study, known as the Shoreline Study, evaluating initial treatment with SAGE-217, treatment-free intervals, and as needed retreatment, in patients with MDD in which patients will be followed for up to a year after treatment.  Dosing in the Mountain Study commenced in December 2018, and we expect to report top-line results from this study in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020. We plan to add an open-label extension trial to the Mountain Study under a separate protocol to continue to follow patients from the Mountain Study after completion for up to six months. As part of our Phase 3 clinical development program for SAGE-217 in depression, we also plan to initiate a placebo-controlled trial to evaluate fixed interval SAGE-217 monotherapy (treatment without traditional antidepressants) for up to a year, which we believe will help us meet the expected requirements for a potential NDA filing and inclusion of maintenance dosing as part of the label, if our development efforts are successful.  In addition, we are conducting a placebo-controlled polysomnography Phase 3 clinical trial of SAGE-217 in patients with MDD who have co-morbid insomnia, known as the Rainforest Study. We expect to report top-line results from the Rainforest Study and the Shoreline Study in 2020.    
As part of the SAGE-217 depression program, we have also commenced dosing in a Phase 2 open-label trial evaluating four weeks of SAGE-217 treatment in a small number of patients with bipolar I/II disorder with a current major depressive episode. Bipolar depression occurs in patients with bipolar disorder.  Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder in which patients experience generally distinct periods of unusually intense emotion, changes in sleep patterns, activity levels, and unusual behaviors which swing from manic episodes characterized by feeling abnormally happy or euphoric to depressive episodes characterized by feeling very sad, down, empty, or hopeless. The Phase 2 open-label trial is intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAGE-217 as the primary endpoint and to study secondary endpoints, including improvements in depressive symptoms and sleep.  We expect to report top-line results from this trial in the first half of 2019.
 Sleep disorders
 We are also exploring the potential of SAGE-217 in the treatment of sleep disorders.  In January 2018, we reported positive results from a Phase 1/2, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of SAGE-217 in the treatment of 45 healthy adult volunteers using a 5-hour phase advance model of insomnia using polysomnography. SAGE-217 was administered as a single dose at either 30 or 45 mg and significantly improved sleep efficiency, or SE, to a median of 85% for 30mg (p<0.0001) and 88% for 45mg (p<0.0001) compared with a median SE of 73% for placebo.  SAGE-217 also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in total sleep time and maintenance as measured by time spent awake after sleep onset.  SAGE-217 was generally well-tolerated and all adverse events were mild, with no serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation.  
 As noted above, we initiated a placebo-controlled polysomnography trial of SAGE-217 in patients with MDD who have co-morbid insomnia in the fourth quarter of 2018.  We plan to seek feedback from the FDA on potential development plans for SAGE-217 in the treatment of sleep disorders.
 Shionogi Collaboration
 In 2018, we entered into a collaboration with Shionogi under which we granted rights to Shionogi for the development and commercialization of SAGE-217 in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Shionogi has commenced Phase 1 clinical studies in Japan to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAGE-217 in Japanese and Caucasian subjects.
 SAGE-324 
 In addition to SAGE-217, we have a portfolio of other novel compounds that target GABAA receptors. SAGE-324 is a novel neuroactive steroid that, like brexanolone and SAGE-217, targets synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. We are considering developing SAGE-324 for a number of neurological conditions, including essential tremor and certain epileptiform disorders.  Results from a recently completed Phase 1 single ascending dose clinical trial of SAGE-324 demonstrated that the profile of SAGE-324 includes good oral bioavailability and a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with once-daily dosing. SAGE-324 demonstrated clear target engagement in the brain using pharmaco-EEG (b-band 
 9

power) as a functional biomarker. SAGE-324 was generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events and with a safety profile consistent with GABAA positive allosteric modulation. A Phase 1 multiple ascending dose clinical trial of SAGE-324 is ongoing.  We also recently initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SAGE-324 in a small number of patients with essential tremor. We expect to report top-line results from the Phase 1 multiple ascending dose clinical trial and the Phase 1 essential tremor clinical trial of SAGE-324 in the second half of 2019.
 Our portfolio also includes SAGE-689, a novel GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator, with which we have conducted non-clinical studies to date, and other compounds at earlier stages of development with a focus on both acute and chronic CNS disorders.
 SAGE-718
 Our second area of focus is the development of novel compounds that target the NMDA receptor. The first product candidate selected for development from this program is SAGE-718, an oxysterol-based positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor which we are exploring in certain cognition-related disorders impacted by NMDA receptor dysfunction, currently in Phase 1 development. Indications involving NMDA receptor hypofunction include certain types, aspects or subpopulations of a number of diseases such as depression, Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and neuropathic pain. We completed a Phase 1 single ascending dose trial of SAGE-718 in 2017 and a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial in 2018. The primary objective of these trials was to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of SAGE-718 in healthy volunteers. Results from these Phase 1 clinical trials of SAGE-718 demonstrated that the profile of SAGE-718 includes good oral bioavailability and a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with once-daily dosing. SAGE-718 was generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. We are continuing our SAGE-718 Phase 1 clinical program with target engagement biomarker studies in healthy volunteers, focused on electrophysiology and imaging, which are ongoing and for which we expect to report results in the first half of 2019. We also recently initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SAGE-718 in a small number of patients with early manifest Huntington’s disease. We expect to report top-line results from this trial in the second half of 2019.
 Further Exploration of GABAA and NMDA Receptors
 We expect to continue to focus our research and development efforts on allosteric modulation of the GABAA and NMDA receptor systems in the brain.  Our earlier stage efforts include GABAA receptor modulator compounds and programs such as SAGE-105 and our ST-320 and ST-210 programs, and additional compounds targeting the NMDA receptor such as SAGE-904, another positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor.  IND-enabling studies of SAGE-904 are ongoing. The GABAA and NMDA receptor systems are broadly accepted as impacting many psychiatric and neurological disorders, spanning disorders of mood, seizure, cognition, anxiety, sleep, pain, and movement among others. We believe that we may have the opportunity to develop molecules from our internal portfolio to address a number of these disorders in the future. Our ability to identify and develop such novel CNS therapies is enabled by our proprietary chemistry platform that is centered, as a starting point, on knowledge of the chemical scaffolds of certain endogenous neuroactive steroid compounds. We believe our knowledge of the chemistry and activity of allosteric modulators allows us to efficiently design molecules with different characteristics.  This diversity enables us to regulate important properties such as half-life, brain penetration and receptor pharmacology to develop product candidates that have the potential for better selectivity, increased tolerability, and fewer off-target side effects than either current CNS therapies or previous therapies which have failed in development.
 Our current focus will remain on those indications where we can independently develop and commercialize our products, if approved. We believe our broad potential pipeline lessens our reliance on the success of any one program. We believe our ability to design and develop novel molecules with distinct profiles and receptor subtype selectivity may also provide us, in the future, with the option, if we choose, to potentially partner certain assets with third parties who possess the development and commercialization capabilities to pursue these programs.

Manufacturing and Supply
 We neither own nor operate, and currently have no plans to own or operate, any manufacturing facilities. We currently source all of our clinical and non-clinical material supply through third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs.  We have also purchased the existing inventory of our proprietary formulation of brexanolone for future commercial sale, if approved, from CMOs, and intend to buy all of our future commercial supplies from CMOs if our product candidates are approved.
 We have completed validation batches and are prepared for commercial supply at the launch of our proprietary formulation of brexanolone, if our NDA is approved. We have a long-term supply agreement in place with our contract manufacturer with respect to brexanolone drug substance.  We have an established relationship under which a CMO manufactures drug product for our proprietary formulation of brexanolone on a purchase order basis under master service and quality agreements. We do not currently have an arrangement in place for either long-term supply of brexanolone drug product or for redundant supply of brexanolone drug product or bulk drug substance. We intend to put a long-term supply agreement in place for commercial manufacturing of brexanolone drug product in the near term, and we have an inventory of brexanolone drug product and drug substance in place to help mitigate any potential supply risks.  All commercial supplies are certified by our CMOs to have been manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP.
 We have established relationships with several CMOs under which the CMOs manufacture clinical and non-clinical supplies of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, as well as drug product, for SAGE-217, SAGE-324, and SAGE-718 on a purchase order basis. All clinical supplies are certified by our CMOs to have been manufactured under 
cGMP. Starting materials and key intermediates to support the production of these candidates are manufactured by other CMOs. We do not currently have arrangements in place for either long-term supply or redundant supply of bulk drug substance or drug product for SAGE-217, SAGE-324, and SAGE-718. Our CMOs manufacture such product candidates on a purchase order basis under master service and quality agreements.  We intend to put a long-term supply agreement in place at the appropriate time for drug substance and drug product for each product candidate, if development continues.  We plan to mitigate potential commercial supply risks for any products that are approved in the future through inventory management and through exploring additional manufacturers to provide API and/or drug product.
 We continue to refine and scale up the manufacturing process for SAGE-217 to supply our Phase 3 clinical trials. We also intend to improve the manufacturing process for our other product candidates and manufacture clinical supplies as development progresses.  We believe we currently have sufficient SAGE-217 drug substance on hand for our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.
 Brexanolone, SAGE-217, SAGE-324 and SAGE-718 are small molecules isolated as stable crystalline solids. We believe the syntheses of brexanolone, SAGE-217, SAGE-324 and SAGE-718 are reliable and reproducible from readily available starting materials, and the synthetic routes are amenable to large-scale manufacturing and do not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to identify and develop drug candidates that are amenable to cost-effective manufacturing at contract manufacturing facilities.  
 Sales and Marketing
 We have completed the buildout of our commercial infrastructure to support an anticipated commercial launch of ZULRESSO for the treatment of PPD in the U.S., including building a nationwide sales team, marketing and market access capabilities, and a patient support team which is located in Raleigh, North Carolina. Our ability to launch ZULRESSO in the U.S., and the timing of any such launch, are dependent on obtaining FDA approval on our expected timeline. In November 2018, the FDA extended the previously disclosed December 19, 2018 PDUFA goal date for a decision on our NDA for ZULRESSO by a period of three months to March 19, 2019.  The timing of the launch of ZULRESSO in the U.S., if approved, is also dependent on the timing of anticipated scheduling of brexanolone as a controlled substance by the DEA, which we expect to be completed 90 days after FDA approval. We anticipate that ZULRESSO, if approved, will launch in the U.S. in June 2019.  As part of our ongoing launch readiness efforts in the U.S., we continue to build the systems, processes, policies, relationships and materials necessary for launch of ZULRESSO in the U.S. in PPD.  
 11

If approved, the settings for administration for ZULRESSO will be limited to healthcare facilities that have been certified under a proposed REMS program under the supervision of qualified staff to mitigate the potential for harm associated with the risk of excessive sedation and loss of consciousness during administration of ZULRESSO.   As part of the proposed REMS, patients who are prescribed ZULRESSO will be required to enroll in a patient registry to allow us to compile additional information to further our understanding of the risk of a loss of consciousness during administration and management of the risk.  
 We believe that we can successfully launch and commercialize ZULRESSO in PPD on our own in the U.S., if the product is approved, using a targeted sales force.  If the NDA for ZULRESSO in the treatment of PPD is approved by the FDA, we anticipate deploying a field sales force of key account managers calling on hospitals and specialty representatives calling on healthcare professionals who treat PPD.  We expect to focus our future sales and marketing efforts, if ZULRESSO is approved for PPD, on obstetricians-gynecologists; psychiatrists; select primary care physicians and pediatricians who are likely to see women shortly after childbirth; and hospitals and other clinics capable of being certified under our REMS program.  As we prepare for a potential launch, we continue to engage in permitted discussions with payors, pharmacy and therapeutic committees and formulary committees. We expect to establish a price for ZULRESSO within the range of $20,000 to $35,000 for the effective average list price per course of therapy. Commercial activities, if the NDA is approved, will focus on executing across key pillars of our go-to-market strategy by enabling Centers of Excellence under the REMS while identifying patient access and reimbursement pathways to support the experience of women with PPD who are treated with ZULRESSO. If approved as a treatment for PPD, ZULRESSO would be administered as a one-time treatment intravenously for 60 hours.  Given the mode of administration, the nature of the REMS and the limitation on the administration of ZULRESSO to a healthcare facility setting certified under the REMS, we expect that use of ZULRESSO, if approved for marketing and sale in the U.S., will at least initially be focused primarily on women with more severe symptoms of PPD, which we estimate is about 20 to 30% of women diagnosed with PPD.
 In addition to our efforts in the U.S., we are refining our market assessments with respect to our product candidates in the EU.  We also plan to continue to evaluate market opportunities for our product candidates in other global markets. In June 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Shionogi under which we granted to Shionogi rights to develop and commercialize SAGE-217 in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. We may decide to establish agreements or alliances with one or more other pharmaceutical company collaborators or distributors to develop and commercialize one or more of our products candidates, if approved, particularly in certain territories outside the United States where we do not believe it makes business or strategic sense for us to proceed on our own.  We may also consider other partnering opportunities if we believe the partnering opportunity will add significant value to our efforts, including through capabilities, infrastructure, speed or financial contributions, in each case depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the expected development pathway and related costs, deal terms, our available resources and whether the transaction makes strategic sense.
 Licenses 
 We have entered into several license agreements related to our proprietary formulation of brexanolone, and a collaboration agreement related to SAGE-217, which are described below.  We have not entered into any license agreements with respect to our other clinical-stage product candidates. 
 CyDex Pharmaceuticals
 In September 2015, we amended and restated our existing commercial license agreement with CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or CyDex. Under the terms of the commercial license agreement, as amended and restated, CyDex has granted us an exclusive license to CyDex’s Captisol drug formulation technology and related intellectual property for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products incorporating brexanolone or SAGE-689, and the development and commercialization of the resulting products in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of any disease or symptom in humans or animals other than (i) the ocular treatment of any disease or condition with a formulation, including a hormone; (ii) topical ocular treatment of inflammatory conditions; (iii) treatment and prophylaxis of fungal infections in humans; and (iv) any ocular treatment for retinal degeneration.
 12

Pursuant to the CyDex license, we are required during the term of the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue active, diligent development of the licensed product, to seek regulatory approval of the licensed product and to commercialize the licensed product following regulatory approval. We must deliver periodic progress reports to CyDex.
 We are obligated to make milestone payments under the amended and restated license agreement with CyDex based on the achievement of clinical development and regulatory milestones in the amount of up to $0.8 million in clinical milestones and up to $3.8 million in regulatory milestones for each of the first two fields with respect to brexanolone; up to $1.3 million in clinical milestones and up to $8.5 million in regulatory milestones for each of the third and fourth fields with respect to brexanolone; and up to $0.8 million in clinical milestones and up to $1.8 million in regulatory milestones for one field with respect to SAGE-689. The CyDex license is perpetual until terminated. We may terminate the CyDex agreement for convenience upon providing 180 days’ prior written notice to CyDex. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement for failure to cure a material breach in the applicable cure period.  We will also be required to pay royalties to CyDex on sales of brexanolone and SAGE-689, if successfully developed, in the low single digits based on levels of net sales. 
 We are also party to a supply agreement with CyDex. Under the supply agreement, we are required to purchase all of our requirements for Captisol with respect to brexanolone and SAGE-689 from CyDex, and CyDex is required to supply us with Captisol for such purposes, subject to certain limitations.
 University of California
 In October 2013, we entered into a license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, or the Regents, which was amended in May 2014. Pursuant to this agreement, and subject to certain rights of the U.S. government and rights retained by the Regents, the Regents granted us a non-exclusive, non-transferable license under all personal property rights of the Regents covering the tangible personal property in an investigational new drug, or IND, application package owned by the Regents, or the Data, and a specified quantity of cGMP grade allopregnanolone, or the Material, to (i) use the Data for reference or incorporation in an IND for the use of the Material as a treatment of status epilepticus, or SE, essential tremor and/or PPD and (ii) use the Material or modifications of the Material to develop a pharmaceutical formulation for clinical trials for SE, essential tremor and/or postpartum depression. The rights licensed to us are not sublicenseable.
 Pursuant to this agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of one or more products containing allopregnanolone, a derived product under the agreement, for the treatment of SE, essential tremor and/or PPD. We are required to deliver written reports to the Regents describing our progress no later than 60 days subsequent to June 30 and December 31 of each fiscal year.
 This agreement requires us to make up to $0.1 million in milestone payments in connection with the first derived product that meets the relevant milestones, and we must also pay royalties of less than 1% to the Regents for each derived product for a period of 15 years following the first commercial sale of such derived product. This agreement will terminate on the earlier to occur of (i) 27 years after the effective date or (ii) 15 years after the last-derived product is first commercially sold. We may terminate this agreement early for convenience upon providing 60 days’ prior written notice to the Regents. The Regents may terminate this agreement early in the event of material default, including failure to provide timely progress reports, after the applicable cure period, or in the event of our bankruptcy. In the event of early termination of this agreement, we have the right to sell any partially made derived products for a period of 120 days from the date of termination, but would not otherwise have rights after termination under the licensed rights to make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale or import products containing allopregnanolone.
 In June 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Regents whereby we were granted an exclusive license to certain patent rights related to the use of allopregnanolone to treat various diseases. In exchange for such license, we paid an upfront payment of $50,000, and will make annual maintenance fees of $15,000 until the calendar year following the first sale, if any, of a licensed product. We are obligated to make milestone payments following the achievement of specified regulatory and sales milestones of up to $0.7 million and $2.0 million in the aggregate, respectively. Following the first sale, if any, of a licensed product, we are obligated to pay royalties at a low single digit percentage of net sales, if any, subject to specified minimum annual royalty amounts. Unless terminated by operation of law or by acts of the parties under the terms of the agreement, the license agreement will terminate when the last-to-expire patents or last-to-be abandoned patent applications expire, whichever is later.
 13

Collaboration Agreement with Shionogi & Co., Ltd.
 In June 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Shionogi. Pursuant to this agreement, Shionogi will be responsible for all clinical development, regulatory filings and commercialization of SAGE-217 for the treatment of MDD and potentially other indications in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Shionogi made an upfront payment of $90.0 million in 2018, and we will be eligible to receive additional payments of up to $485.0 million if certain regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved by Shionogi.
 Under the terms of the agreement, the potential future milestone payments include up to $70.0 million for the achievement of specified regulatory milestones, up to $30.0 million for the achievement of specified commercialization milestones, and up to $385.0 million for the achievement of specified net sales milestones. We will receive tiered royalties on sales of SAGE-217 in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, if development efforts are successful, with tiers averaging in the low to mid-twenty percent range, subject to other terms of the agreement. Due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development, we may not receive any additional milestone payments or any royalty payments from Shionogi.
 Shionogi has also granted us certain rights to co-promote SAGE-217 in Japan. We maintain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize SAGE-217 outside of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. The upfront cash payment and any payments for milestones and royalties we receive from Shionogi are non-refundable, non-creditable and not subject to set-off.
 The agreement with Shionogi will terminate on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis on the date on which the royalty term has expired in each country in Shionogi’s territory for such licensed product and will ultimately expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. At any time following the second anniversary date of the agreement, Shionogi may remove South Korea or Taiwan from the covered territories, for any reason or no reason upon 180 days’ prior written notice. Shionogi may terminate the agreement in its entirety for any reason or no reason upon 180 days’ prior written notice, provided that such termination shall not be effective prior to the second anniversary of the agreement. Shionogi may also terminate the agreement in the event of a serious adverse event or a clinical failure upon 60 days’ written notice to us. Either party may terminate this agreement early in the event of an uncured material breach within 180 days’ after notice is delivered to the other party. 
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary know-how and technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We may also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. To protect our rights to our proprietary know-how and technology, we require all employees, as well as our consultants and contract research organization, or CROs, when feasible, to enter into agreements that require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants, and CROs in the course of their service to us.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to compositions, methods of use, treatment and patient selection, formulations and manufacturing processes created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
 14

The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions, including the United States, permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing, or may in the future pursue, will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will be enforceable or provide sufficient protection from competitors.
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by our issued patents, our pending patent applications or of patent applications we may file in the future. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, or similar proceedings outside the U.S., to determine priority of invention.
 Patents
 We hold issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States, and in certain foreign countries. Our intellectual property holdings include and are not limited to:

• | One allowed United States patent application, exclusively licensed to us, covering a method of using our proprietary brexanolone formulation to treat postpartum depression, and United States and foreign patent applications covering our proprietary formulation of brexanolone and uses of the formulation to treat various CNS disorders, including postpartum depression.

Patent Term
 The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the U.S. PTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.
 15

The term of a U.S. patent may also be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug, and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, also have patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extension on patents covering those products, their methods of use, and/or methods of manufacture.
 Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we may rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Companies typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of their business that are not amenable to, or that they do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets, if any, and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and partners. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also generally provide that all relevant inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
Competition
 The biopharmaceuticals industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies similar to our products will increase.
 There are also no pharmacological therapies specifically approved for the treatment of PPD.  Current standard of care for PPD commonly consists of psychotherapy, however, patients with moderate or severe PPD are often prescribed anti-depressant medications such as SSRIs and SNRIs.  
 MDD patients are typically treated with a variety of anti-depressant medications such as SSRIs and SNRIs.    A number of companies are developing product candidates intended for the treatment of MDD, including NMDA receptor antagonists or partial antagonists such as esketamine, rapastinel, and apimostinel and the opioid receptor antagonist combination product, buprenorphine/samidorphan. 
 The treatment plan for bipolar depression commonly consists of a combination of medication and psychotherapy.  Medications used to treat bipolar depression include mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics and antidepressants. 
 There are a number of pharmacological treatments and nonpharmacological treatments for sleep disorders depending on the cause and nature of the sleep disruption.
 In the field of neuroactive steroids focused specifically on modulation of GABAA receptors, our principal competitor is Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Marinus.  Marinus is developing a form of ganaxolone, a known GABAA positive allosteric modulator neuroactive steroid. A number of companies are working to develop products targeted at the NMDA receptor, both antagonists and agonists.

Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.  If we are successful in developing and gaining approval of any of our product candidates, we expect competition in the indications we are pursuing will focus on efficacy, safety, convenience, availability, and price.  Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring/pharmacovigilance, safety and periodic reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed in a given jurisdiction, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained and/or generated, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and the drug must be approved by the relevant regulatory authority or authorities.
U.S. Drug Development
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, and local statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject a company to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold on a clinical investigation, warning or untitled letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and generally involves the following:
  
• | Completion of extensive non-clinical studies and testing, sometimes referred to as non-clinical laboratory tests, non-clinical animal studies and formulation studies, in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes collectively referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an NDA for marketing approval of a new drug;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept and file the NDA for review;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17

 
• | Satisfactory completion of a potential FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Payment of applicable user fees and FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct development stages: non-clinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the non-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the non-clinical tests must comply with federal laws and regulations, including, for animal studies, the Animal Welfare Act and GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. Some non-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted, but an IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocols for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials, including whether subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or to patients with the disease or condition being studied under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any given clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols describing, among other details, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants, and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and compliance with informed consent principles, and FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 18

Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites (typically from several hundred to several thousand subjects), and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended for drugs intended for chronic dosing to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, increased rates of serious suspected adverse events, or findings from other studies or from animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Success in one phase does not mean that the results will be observed in subsequent phases. Each phase may involve multiple studies. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial, and may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, we must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 NDA and FDA Review Process
 The results of non-clinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the United States.
 19

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, the FDA may also issue a Written Request asking a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies related to a particular active moiety; if the sponsor agrees and meets certain requirements, the sponsor may be eligible to receive additional marketing exclusivity for its drug product containing such active moiety.
 Under the PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee, unless subject to a waiver. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2019, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, is approximately $2.6 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug program fee for human drugs of approximately $0.3 million. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan-designated indication.
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA aims to complete its initial review of an NDA and respond to the applicant within 10 months from the filing date for a standard NDA and, and within six months from the filing date for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and integrity of the data submitted in the NDA. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. For example, the advisory committee may recommend or the FDA may determine that a REMS program is necessary to ensure safe use of the product. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation process for an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or one or more additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, non-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such additional data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 20

There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific patient populations and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA typically requires that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, and may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which may involve clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and/or efficacy and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if the FDA determines that a REMS is required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. For example, the FDA has proposed a REMS for ZULRESSO to mitigate the potential for harm associated with the risk of excessive sedation and loss of consciousness during the ZULRESSO infusion.  If approved, as part of the REMS, administration of ZULRESSO will be limited to certified healthcare facilities that have been certified under a REMS program under the supervision of qualified staff, and  patients who are prescribed ZULRESSO will be required to enroll in a patient registry to allow us to compile additional information to further our understanding of the risk of excessive sedation and loss of consciousness during administration and management of the risk.  Any limitations on approval, marketing or use for any of our products could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of those products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug product intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA for the drug for the proposed rare disease or condition. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the common name of the therapeutic agent and its designated orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not, by itself, convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other sponsors’ applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity operates independently from other regulatory exclusivities and other protection against generic competition, including patents that we hold for our products. A sponsor of a product application that has received an orphan drug designation may also be granted tax incentives for clinical research undertaken to support the application. In addition, the FDA may coordinate with the sponsor on research study design for an orphan drug and may exercise its discretion to grant marketing approval on the basis of more limited product safety and efficacy data than would ordinarily be required, based on the limited size of the applicable patient population.
 Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. The FDA can revoke a product’s orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, including when the holder of the approved orphan drug application is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet patient needs. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, benefits.
 21

Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has several programs that are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. Fast Track designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation are two of these programs and apply to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the development of the product and may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Breakthrough Therapy based on preliminary clinical evidence which meet the criteria outlined in the FDA’s programs. Under the Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy expedited programs, the FDA may review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete NDA is submitted if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. 
 Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and offers a significant improvement in the safety and effectiveness of treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. Significant improvement may be shown by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months from the date of the NDA filing. 
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if the product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening illness and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments.  Accelerated approval for a product means that it may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug, such as:
  
• | distribution restricted to certain facilities or physicians with special training or experience; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | distribution conditioned on the performance of specified medical procedures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The limitations imposed would be commensurate with the specific safety concerns presented by the drug. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
 22

Pediatric Trials
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was signed into law on July 9, 2012, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from non-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA, if it learns of new information, may also request that the sponsor amend the initial PSP.
Post-marketing Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the Internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional non-clinical studies and clinical trials. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA.
 FDA regulations also require that approved products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 23

Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, administrative enforcement, warning or untitled letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil penalties or criminal prosecution, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 Other Regulatory Matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services; the United States Department of Justice; the DEA; the Consumer Product Safety Commission; the Federal Trade Commission; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; the Environmental Protection Agency; and state and local governments.  
 In the United States, a drug product approved by the FDA may also be subject to regulation under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as a controlled substance.  The CSA is administered by the DEA and establishes, among other things, certain registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements for controlled substances.  The CSA classifies controlled substances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V. FDA approved pharmaceutical products may be listed in Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances.  An approved drug product or drug candidate that has not yet been approved by the FDA may be subject to scheduling as a controlled substance under the CSA, depending on the drug’s potential for abuse.  For a drug approved by the FDA and determined to require control under the CSA, the CSA requires the DEA to issue an interim final order scheduling the drug within 90 days after the FDA approves the drug and the DEA receives a scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation from the Department of Health and Human Services, after it has been completed by FDA.  We expect FDA to recommend scheduling of brexanolone as a controlled substance, if approved.  
 In the United States, arrangements and interactions with health care professionals, third-party payors, patients and others will expose us to broadly applicable anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims and other health care laws and regulations.  These broadly applicable laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements or relationships through which we sell, market and distribute our products, if and when we obtain marketing approval.  In the U.S., federal and state health care laws and regulations that may affect our operations include:
  
• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a company marketing a prescription drug (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward the referral of an individual or purchase, lease or order, or the arranging for or recommending the purchase or order, of a particular item or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors, or speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, damages, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.

• | The federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the federal government or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Many pharmaceutical manufacturers have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper activities. The government may deem companies to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation may include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant civil penalties for each separate false or fraudulent claim, and the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.

• | Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, and disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability, private litigation, or adverse publicity. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties, such as hospitals, healthcare professionals, and research institutions from which we or our collaborators obtain patient health information, that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to the HIPAA information privacy and security provisions – other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits – we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we or our agents knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. In addition, HIPAA does not replace federal, state, or other laws that may grant individuals even greater privacy protections.

• | Analogous state and local laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, regardless of the payer. We also may become subject to other state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to clinical trials, or information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws and local ordinances that require identification or licensing of sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Substantial resources are necessary to ensure that our business arrangements and interactions with health care professionals, third party payors, patients and others comply with applicable health care laws and regulations. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law, and if we are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.
 Numerous other laws may apply to our products.  Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to herein as ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act.
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
 Changes in statutes, regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, if any, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA (“testing phase”), plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application (“approval phase”). This patent term restoration period may be reduced by the FDA if it finds that applicant did not act with due diligence during the testing phase or the approval phase. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if circumstances permit, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our then owned or licensed patents, if any, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 26

Some of our products may also be entitled to certain non-patent-related data exclusivity under the FDCA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA may not be submitted by another company for another drug containing the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA Orange Book by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a full NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. Three-year exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications that rely on the information that served as the basis of granting three-year exclusivity. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations, and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. 
 European Union Drug Development
 In the European Union (EU), our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory authorities in the EU has been obtained.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive in a manner that is often not uniform. This has led to variations in the rules governing the conduct of clinical trials in the individual EU Member States. The EU legislator has, therefore, adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the EU Clinical Trials Regulation. The new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, which will replace the EU Clinical Trials Directive, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. The Clinical Trials Regulation is expected to start to apply in late 2019 or in 2020. 
 Clinical trials in the EU must currently be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the EU Clinical Trials Directive and applicable good clinical practice standards, as implemented into national legislation by EU Member States. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each EU Member State where there is a site at which the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 In the EU, pediatric data or an approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, or waiver, is required to have been approved by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, prior to submission of a marketing authorization application to the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU Member States. In most EU countries, we are also required to have an approved PIP before we can begin enrolling pediatric patients in a clinical trial. 
 27

European Union Drug Review and Approval and Post-marketing Requirements
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, (which is comprised of 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after a related Marketing Authorization, or MA, has been granted. Marketing authorization for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures. These are through a centralized, mutual recognition procedure, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (single EU Member State). The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). If a related positive opinion is provided by the EMA, the European Commission will grant a centralized marketing authorization that is valid in all EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Associations, or EFTA, countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).
 The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which grant of centralized marketing authorization is in the interest of patients in the EU.
 The decentralized authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for authorization to several EU Member States simultaneously for a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member State. The competent authorities of a single EU Member State, the reference member state, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned member states, are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment. The only exception to this is where an EU Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product. In these circumstances, the matter is submitted to the Heads of Medicines Agencies, or CMDh, for review. The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU Member States.
 The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application in the EU is 210 days, not including clock stops during which applicants respond to questions from the competent authority. The initial marketing authorization granted in the EU is valid for five years. The authorization may be renewed and valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the European Commission decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. The renewal of a marketing authorization is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities or the EMA.
 The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with the EU’s pharmacovigilance legislation. This includes requirements to conduct pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products.
 Various requirements apply to the manufacturing and placing on the EU market of medicinal products.  Manufacture of medicinal products in the EU requires a manufacturing authorization. The manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and APIs, including the manufacture of APIs outside of the EU with the intention to import the APIs into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States.  Marketing authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU Member States’ requirements applicable to the manufacturing of medicinal products.
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Breaches of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment.  These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of medicinal products to the general public and may also impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
 28

European Union New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
 In the European Union, innovative medicinal products that are subject to marketing authorization on the basis of a full dossier and do not fall within the scope of the concept of global marketing authorization, which prevents the same marketing authorization holder or members of the same group from obtaining separate data and market exclusivity periods for medicinal products that contain the same active substance, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application or biosimilar application for eight years from the date of authorization of the innovative product, after which a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced. However, the generic product or biosimilar products cannot be marketed in the EU for a further two years thereafter. The overall ten-year period may be extended for a further year to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 In the European Union, orphan drug designations are granted by the European Commission based on a scientific opinion by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products in relation to medicinal products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union and in relation to which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product.
 Orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of exclusivity in all EU Member States and a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process.  However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the product.  Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the similar product is deemed safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product.  The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 In addition, grant of orphan designation by the European Commission also entitles the holder of this designation to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing authorization. Orphan drug designation does not, in itself, convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and authorization process.
 Rest of the World Regulation
 For other countries outside of the U.S. and EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 Approval by a regulatory authority in one jurisdiction does not guarantee approval by comparable regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements applicable to a given country, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in such country if we choose to seek such approval, or we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 29

Coverage and Reimbursement
 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Changes in government legislation or regulation and changes in private third-party payors’ policies toward reimbursement for our products, if successfully developed and approved, may reduce reimbursement of our products’ costs to physicians, pharmacies, patients, and distributors. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results for products, if any, we commercialize in the future. 
 The pricing and reimbursement environment for our products may change in the future and become more challenging due to, among other reasons, policies advanced by the Trump Administration, federal agencies, new healthcare legislation passed by Congress or fiscal challenges faced by all levels of government health administration authorities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, for example, allocated new federal funding to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same condition. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although ARRA does not mandate the use of the results of comparative effectiveness studies for reimbursement purposes, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any products for which we receive marketing approval or on the reimbursement policies of public and private payors. It is possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of any product for which we receive marketing approval. For example, if third-party payors find our products not to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 The ACA is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals, the provision of subsidies to eligible individuals enrolled in plans offered on the health insurance exchanges, and the expansion of the Medicaid program.  This law has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry.  Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the “donut hole”), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, expansion of the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program, or 340B program, fraud and abuse and enforcement.  These changes have impacted previously existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.  
 One of the goals of ACA was to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid. The ACA also imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or ownership interest that is not timely, accurately, or completely reported (annual maximum of $150,000), and $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (annual maximum of $1 million). The reporting requirements apply only to manufacturers of products for which reimbursement is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program.  
 30

Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the ACA.  For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact sales of our approved products that are approved and that we successfully commercialize, and our business and financial condition.  Where Medicaid patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new options made available through the ACA, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues.  In addition, there have been delays in the implementation of key provisions of the ACA, including the excise tax on generous employer-based health insurance plans.  The implications of these delays for business and financial condition, if any, are not yet clear.
 
Moreover, additional legislative changes to or regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible.  The Trump Administration has identified repeal and replacement of the ACA as one of its priorities, and has altered the implementation of the ACA and related laws.  In this regard, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed into law in December 2017, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.”  The nature and extent of any additional legislative changes to the ACA are uncertain at this time. In addition, in December 2018, a federal district court judge, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the ACA unconstitutional in its entirety because once Congress repealed the “individual mandate” provision as part of tax reform legislation enacted in late 2017, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. The court reasoned that the “individual mandate” was not severable from the rest of the ACA and found the entire Act was an unconstitutional exercise of Congressional authority. While the Trump administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. We expect that the ACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved.
 Other legislative changes relating to reimbursement have been adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services under Part A and B, including drugs and biologicals, and most payments to plans under Medicare Part D were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, or BCA, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The BCA requires sequestration for most federal programs, excluding Medicaid, Social Security, and certain other programs. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction to 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. As long as these cuts remain in effect, they could adversely impact payment for any products we may commercialize in the future. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability.
 Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
 If we are successful in developing and gaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, sales of our products will be dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, which are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services.  Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product for which we received marketing approval could reduce physician usage of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.  In the United States, healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products they use through Medicare, Medicaid, and other government healthcare programs, as well as through commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 31

If we are successful in developing and gaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, we intend to participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.  The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental programs impose obligations to report pricing figures to the federal government, meaning that we would be subject to these price reporting and other compliance obligations. Other programs impose limits on the price we will be permitted to charge certain entities for our products, if any, for which we receive regulatory approval. Statutory and regulatory changes or other agency action regarding these programs and their requirements could negatively affect the coverage and reimbursement by these programs of products for which we receive regulatory approval and could negatively impact our results of operations.
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program was established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and amended by the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 as well as subsequent legislation. If we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we will be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the state for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates will be based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These data will include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug, which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts, and other price concessions. The ACA made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, and CMS issued a final regulation, which became effective on April 1, 2016, to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the ACA. Our failure to comply with these price reporting and rebate payment options could negatively impact our financial results.
 Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing discount program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs.  These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The ACA expanded the list of covered entities to include certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, but exempts “orphan drugs” from the ceiling price requirements for these covered entities. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and in general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. Changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid Drug Rebate amount under the ACA or otherwise also could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.
 HRSA issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019.  It is currently unclear how HRSA will apply its enforcement authority under the new regulation.  HRSA also is implementing a ceiling price reporting requirement related to the 340B program during the first quarter of 2019, pursuant to which we are required to report our 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis. Implementation of the civil monetary penalties regulation and the issuance of any other final regulations and guidance could affect our obligations under the 340B program in ways we cannot anticipate. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in the inpatient setting.
 Federal law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program report average sales price information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under the Medicare Part B program. Manufacturers calculate the average sales price based on a statutorily defined formula as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B. Statutory or regulatory changes or CMS guidance could affect the average sales price calculations for our approved products that we successfully commercialize and the resulting Medicare payment rate, and could negatively

impact our results of operations. Also, the Medicare Part B drug payment methodology is subject to change based on potential demonstration projects undertaken by CMS or potential legislation enacted by Congress.
 Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount will be computed each quarter based on our submission to CMS of our current average manufacturer prices and best prices for the quarter. If we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the 340B drug pricing program.
 If we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and consequently the 340B drug pricing program, we could be held liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price, or if we are found to have charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price.  In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false average manufacturer price or best price information to the government, we may be liable for significant civil monetary penalties per item of false information. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly average manufacturer price and best price data on a timely basis could result in a significant civil monetary penalty per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we will participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, no federal payments would be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.
 CMS and the OIG have pursued manufacturers that were alleged to have failed to report these data to the government in a timely manner. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. If we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and consequently the 340B drug pricing program, we cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect. 
 In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Department of Defense (“DoD”), Public Health Service, and Coast Guard (the “Big Four agencies”) and certain federal grantees, we will be required to participate in the VA Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) pricing program, established under Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, we will be obligated to make our “covered” drugs (i.e., innovator drugs and biologics) available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to the Big Four agencies that is no higher than the Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”), which is a price calculated pursuant to a statutory formula. The FCP is derived from a calculated price point called the “non-federal average manufacturer price” (“Non-FAMP”), which we will be required to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to significant civil monetary penalties for each item of false information. The FSS contract also contains extensive disclosure and certification requirements.  In addition, Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008, will require us to pay quarterly rebates to DoD on utilization of covered drugs that are dispensed through DoD’s Tricare network pharmacies to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP for the calendar year that the product was dispensed. If we overcharge the government in connection with the FSS contract or Tricare Retail Pharmacy Rebate Program, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we will be required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and any response to government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.

In addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States, and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 In various EU Member States, we expect to be subject to continuous cost-cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative. Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including countries representing major markets. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. On January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on health technologies assessment. This legislative proposal is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The proposal provides that EU Member States will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU Member States will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. The European Commission has stated that the role of the draft HTA regulation is not to influence pricing and reimbursement decisions in the individual EU Member States. However, this consequence cannot be excluded.
 Employees
 As of February 11, 2019, we employed 637 full-time employees, including 282 in research and development and 355 in general and administrative and no part-time employees. 92 of our employees hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective-bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Facilities 
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In October 2018, we entered into the Seventh Amendment to the Lease (the “Seventh Amendment”) to increase the amount of square feet of office space that we lease in the multi-tenant building in which our corporate headquarters are located. Prior to entering the Seventh Amendment, we rented 54,943 square feet of office space in this multi-tenant building under an operating lease that was scheduled to expire on August 15, 2024. The Seventh Amendment increased the amount of leased space at this location by 3,499 square feet beginning on December 1, 2018.  The lease for this additional space will expire on August 31, 2024.  Additionally, the term of the existing lease has been extended from August 15, 2024 until the expiration date of the Seventh Amendment on August 31, 2024.

In May 2016, we entered into a separate lease with an original expiration date of February 28, 2022, under which, beginning on September 1, 2016, we rent 19,805 square feet of additional office space in a separate multi-tenant building in Cambridge, MA. In April 2018, we entered into the First Amendment to the lease for office space in that building. We increased the amount of square feet of office space from 19,805 square feet to 40,419 square feet, an increase of 20,614 square feet, consisting of (i) 13,481 square feet beginning on August 1, 2018, and (ii) 7,133 square feet beginning on October 1, 2018.  The term for this additional space will expire on August 31, 2024.  Additionally, the term of the existing lease was extended from February 28, 2022 until August 31, 2024. We have entered into other non-material leases and expect to lease additional space prior to the expiration of our leases to meet the needs of the business.
