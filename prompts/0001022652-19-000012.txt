Industry Trends
For over two decades the mobile industry has experienced tremendous advancements and growth. As the largest technology platform in the world, mobile connectivity has changed the way we work, the way we live and the way we connect with each other. The scale and pace of innovation in mobile technology, especially around connectivity and computing capabilities, is also impacting industries beyond traditional wireless.
Looking forward, Inseego is working with leading companies in the mobile ecosystem to further develop, commercialize and accelerate the availability of 5G NR based solutions, which represents the next generation of mobile technology. 5G has been coined “the 4th industrial revolution” due to the richness of use cases targeted, and refers to 5G NR, which is the standard adopted by 3GPP, an international consortium responsible for the development of mobile standards. 5G has been designed to support faster data rates, lower network latency and wider bandwidths of spectrum. Incorporating many of the innovations developed for 4G LTE, 5G is also expected to be scalable and adaptable across a variety of use cases, which include, among others, empowering new industries and services, such as autonomous vehicles and industrial applications, through ultra-reliable, ultra-low latency communication links and connecting a significant number of IoT service and devices, including devices for connected home and smart cities, with connectivity designed to meet ultra-low power, complexity and cost requirements. 5G is also expected to enhance mobile broadband services, including ultra-high definition (4K HD) video streaming and augmented and virtual reality, with multi-gigabit speeds.
The widespread adoption of IoT in enterprise applications, including within the manufacturing, agriculture, industrial automation, retail and healthcare industries, among others, along with an increasing dependence on smartphones and always-connected computers, the constraints of 4G LTE technology are prompting mobile network operators to embark on an accelerated rollout of 5G communications to keep pace with expected network demands. As the fifth-generation wireless broadband technology, 5G is based on the IEEE 802.11ac standard. The key operating ranges for 5G spectrum globally are in the sub-6 GHz (below 6 GHz), 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands and with speed offerings up to 1Gb per second and millisecond latency, providing better coverage and signaling efficiency. Networks utilizing 5G technology are expected to launch meaningfully in 2019.
Growing demand for high speed data, ever increasing demand for machine-to-machine communications and low latency requirements for new applications are the key factors contributing to the growth of the 5G. 4G LTE will continue to operate alongside 5G as a major part of the mobile ecosystem. According to GSMA’s Intelligence report on The 5G era in the US, “4G and 5G networks will coexist and remain complementary for many years; as such, operators can service a significant share of the data traffic on 4G networks, leaving 5G with the dual remit of absorbing overflow capacity and underpinning consumer and 
5

enterprise services that require higher speeds and/or lower latency.” As such, most 5G devices are expected to include multimode support for 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi, enabling service continuity where 5G has yet to be deployed and simultaneous connectivity across 4G and Wi-Fi technologies, while also allowing mobile operators to utilize current network deployments. At the same time, 4G is expected to continue to evolve in parallel with the development of 5G and become fundamental to many of the key 5G technologies, such as support for unlicensed spectrum, gigabit LTE user data rates (currently available from Inseego) and cellular IoT with connectivity designed to meet the needs of ultra-low power and low cost applications. The first phase of 5G networks are expected to support mobile broadband services in lower spectrum below 6 GHz (sub-6 GHz) bands, as well as higher millimeter wave (“mmWave”) bands.
Analyst firm CCS Insights (“CCS”) recently increased its predictions for the size of the global 5G market, based on the fact that numerous operators around the world were bringing services to market more quickly than they had originally indicated. CCS estimates that global 5G connections will hit 340 million in 2021 and pass the one billion mark in the first half of 2023. By 2025, the firm says 5G connections will number 2.7 billion, or more than one out of every five connections in the world. GSMA Intelligence anticipates that the U.S. will have “one of the fastest customer migrations to 5G in the world,” with 5G mobile connections reaching 100 million in early 2023 and more than 190 million by 2025.
We continue to work closely with mobile operators, chipset suppliers and infrastructure vendors around the world on 5G developments and trials in preparation for commercial network launches. 
The adoption of IoT technology continues to grow as companies across a wide range of industries are leveraging cellular IoT technologies to increase efficiency, gain better customer insights, facilitate compliance and build new business models.
