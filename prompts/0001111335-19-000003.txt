The Company’s Industry
The Company operates in the automotive industry, which is cyclical and highly sensitive to general economic conditions. The Company believes that future success in the automotive industry is, in part, dependent on alignment with customers to support their efforts to effectively meet the challenges associated with the following significant trends and developments in the global automotive industry.

• | Electronic content and connectivity - The electronic content of vehicles continues to increase due to various regulatory requirements and consumer demand for increased vehicle performance and functionality. The use of electronic components can reduce weight, expedite assembly, enhance fuel economy, improve emissions, increase safety and enhance vehicle performance. These benefits coincide with vehicles becoming more electric, connected and automated. Additionally, digital and portable technologies have dramatically influenced the lifestyle of today’s consumers, who expect products that enable such a lifestyle. Consequently, the vehicle cockpit is transforming into a fully digital environment with device and power connectivity. This requires increased electronic and technical content such as in-vehicle communication, navigation and entertainment capabilities. While original equipment vehicle manufacturers ("OEMs") are taking different paths to connect their vehicles to high-speed broadband internet connections in the short-term, future vehicles are expected to be built with vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity systems. There is momentum by OEMs to integrate discrete electronic control units into a multi-core domain controller to increase efficiency and reduce power consumption, cost and weight.


• | Advanced driver assistance systems ("ADAS") and autonomous driving - The industry continues to advance toward semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles. The Society of Automotive Engineers has defined five levels of autonomy ranging from levels one and two with driver-assist functions whereby the driver is responsible for monitoring the environment, to level five with full autonomy under all conditions. Levels one and two are already popular in the market while levels three and above require a combination of sensors, radars, camera and LiDARs, requiring sensor fusion and machine learning technologies, as the system assumes the role of monitoring the environment. Level three includes features such as highway pilot and parking assist technology, for which a increased market penetration rate is expected over the next several years. 


• | Safety and security - Governments continue to focus regulatory efforts on safer transportation. Accordingly, OEMs are working to improve occupant and pedestrian safety by incorporating more safety-oriented technology in their vehicles. Additionally, in-vehicle connectivity has increased the need for robust cybersecurity systems to protect data, applications and associated infrastructure. Security features are evolving with advances in sensors and silicon. Suppliers must enable the security/safety initiatives of their customers including the development of new technologies.


• | Vehicle standardization - OEMs continue to standardize vehicle platforms on a global basis, resulting in a lower number of individual vehicle platforms, design cost savings and further scale of economies through the production of a greater number of models from each platform. Having operations in the geographic markets in which OEMs produce global platforms enables suppliers to meet OEMs’ needs more economically and efficiently, thus making global coverage a source of significant competitive advantage for suppliers with a diversified global footprint. Additionally, OEMs are looking to suppliers for increased collaboration to lower costs, reduce risks and decrease overall time to market. Suppliers that can provide fully

engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing. As vehicles become more connected and cockpits more digitized, suppliers that can deliver modular hardware architectures, “open” software architectures and a software platform approach will be poised to help OEMs achieve greater reuse of validated hardware circuitry, design scalability and faster development cycles.

The Company’s Competition 
The automotive sector is concentrated, but operates under highly competitive conditions resulting from the globalized nature of the industry, high fixed costs and the resulting need for scale economies, market dynamics including share in mature economies and positioning in emerging economies and the low cost of switching for the end consumer. Accordingly, OEMs rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of financial viability, product quality, price competitiveness, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design and manufacturing capability and flexibility, customer service and overall management. The Company's primary independent competitors include but are not limited to Alpine Electronics, Aptiv PLC, Continental AG, Denso Corporation, Samsung, LG Corporation, Nippon Seiki, Panasonic Corporation, Pioneer Corporation, Mobis, Innolux, Magnetti Marelli, and Robert Bosch GmbH.
The Company's Product Sales Backlog
The Company typically enters into customer agreements at the beginning of a vehicle life cycle with the intent to fulfill customer-purchasing requirements for the entire vehicle production life cycle. The vehicle life cycle typically includes the two to three year pre-production period and production for a term covering the life of such vehicle model or platform, generally between three to five years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. The Company's customers make no firm commitments regarding volume and may terminate these agreements or orders at any time. Therefore, we believe that these arrangements do not represent firm orders. 
The Company's backlog, also referred to as forecasted revenue from awarded programs, is the estimated remaining cumulative awarded life-of-program sales. Several factors may change forecasted revenue from awarded programs; namely, new business wins, vehicle production volume changes, customer price reductions, currency exchange rates, component take rates by customers and short cycled or canceled platforms. The Company’s Electronics segment backlog was $21.5 billion as of December 31, 2018.
The Company’s Business is Seasonal and Cyclical
Historically, the Company’s business has been moderately seasonal because its largest North American customers typically cease production for approximately two weeks in July for model year changeovers and approximately one week in December during the winter holidays. Customers in Europe historically shut down vehicle production during a portion of August and one week in December. In China, customers typically shut down approximately one week in early October and one week in January or February.  Additionally, third-quarter automotive production traditionally is lower as new vehicle models enter production.
The Company’s Workforce and Employee Relations
The Company’s workforce as of December 31, 2018 included approximately 10,000 persons, of which approximately 6,000 were salaried employees and 4,000 were hourly workers. Many of the Company’s employees are members of industrial trade unions and confederations within their respective countries, including Europe, Asia and South America. Many of these organizations operate under collectively bargained contracts that are not specific to any one employer. The Company constantly works to establish and maintain positive, cooperative relations with its unions and work representatives around the world and believes that its relationships with unionized employees are satisfactory. 
The Company’s Product Research and Development
The Company’s research and development efforts are intended to maintain leadership positions in core products and provide the Company with a competitive edge as it seeks additional business with new and existing customers. The Company also works with technology development partners, including customers, to develop technological capabilities and new products and applications.

The Company’s Intellectual Property 
The Company owns significant intellectual property, including a number of patents, copyrights, proprietary tools and technologies and trade secrets and is involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Although the Company’s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining its competitive position, no single patent, copyright, proprietary tool or technology, trade secret or license, or group of related patents, copyrights, proprietary tools or technologies, trade secrets or licenses is, in the opinion of management, of such value to the Company that its business would be materially affected by the expiration or termination thereof. The Company’s general policy is to apply for patents on an ongoing basis, in appropriate countries, on its patentable developments that are considered to have commercial significance. The Company also views its name and mark as significant to its business as a whole. In addition, the Company holds rights in a number of other trade names and marks applicable to certain of its businesses and products that it views as important to such businesses and products.

The Company’s Raw Materials and Suppliers
Raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture of its products include electronics components, resins, copper and precious metals. All of the materials used are generally available from numerous sources. In general, the Company does not carry inventories of raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had not experienced significant shortages of raw materials. The Company monitors its supply base and endeavors to work with suppliers and customers to attempt to mitigate the impact of potential material shortages and supply disruptions. While 
7

the Company does not anticipate any significant interruption in the supply of raw materials, there can be no assurance that sufficient sources or amounts of all necessary raw materials will be available in the future. 
The automotive supply industry is subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials, which have historically placed operational and financial burdens on the entire supply chain. Accordingly, the Company continues to take actions with its customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with customers include collaboration on alternative product designs and material specifications, contractual price escalation clauses and negotiated customer recoveries. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with suppliers include aggregation of purchase requirements to achieve optimal volume benefits, negotiation of cost-reductions and identification of more cost competitive suppliers. While these actions are designed to offset the impact of inflationary pressures, the Company cannot provide assurance that it will be successful in fully offsetting increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures.
