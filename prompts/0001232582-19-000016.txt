Item 1. | Business

GENERAL
Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is an externally-advised REIT focused on investing opportunistically in the hospitality industry with a focus predominantly on full-service upscale and upper upscale hotels in the U.S. that have a revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) generally less than two times the U.S. national average. Additional information can be found on our website at www.ahtreit.com. We were formed as a Maryland corporation in May 2003 and commenced operations in August 2003, as a self-advised REIT. In November 2014, we completed the spin-off of our asset management business, forming Ashford Inc. as a separate publicly traded company, and we became advised by Ashford Hospitality Advisors LLC (“Ashford LLC”), a subsidiary of Ashford Inc. We continue to own our lodging investments and conduct our business through Ashford Hospitality Limited Partnership (“Ashford Trust OP”), our operating partnership. Ashford OP General Partner LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, serves as the sole general partner of our operating partnership.
Our hotel properties are primarily branded under the widely recognized upscale and upper upscale brands of Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, and Intercontinental Hotel Group. As of December 31, 2018, we owned interests in the following assets:

• | 119 consolidated hotel properties, including 117 directly owned and two owned through a majority-owned investment in a consolidated entity, which represent 25,087 total rooms (or 25,060 net rooms excluding those attributable to our partner);


• | 90 hotel condominium units at WorldQuest Resort in Orlando, Florida (“WorldQuest”);


• | a 25.0% ownership in Ashford Inc. common stock with a carrying value of $1.9 million and a fair value of $31.0 million; and


• | a 16.3% ownership in OpenKey with a carrying value of $2.6 million.

For federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, which subjects us to limitations related to operating hotels. As of December 31, 2018, our 119 hotel properties were leased or owned by our wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that are treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes (collectively, these subsidiaries are referred to as “Ashford TRS”). Ashford TRS then engages third-party or affiliated hotel management companies to operate the hotels under management contracts. Hotel operating results related to these properties are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
We are advised by Ashford LLC through an advisory agreement. All of the hotel properties in our portfolio are currently asset-managed by Ashford LLC. We do not have any employees. All of the services that might be provided by employees are provided to us by Ashford LLC.
We do not operate any of our hotel properties directly; instead we employ hotel management companies to operate them for us under management contracts. As of December 31, 2018, Remington Lodging & Hospitality, LLC, together with its affiliates (“Remington Lodging”), which is beneficially wholly owned by Mr. Monty J. Bennett, our Chairman, and Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., our Chairman Emeritus, managed 81 of our 119 hotel properties and WorldQuest. Third-party management companies managed the remaining hotel properties. 
Ashford Inc. also provides other products and services to us or our hotel properties through certain entities in which Ashford Inc. has an ownership interest. These products and services include project management services, mortgage placement services, audiovisual services, real estate advisory services, investment management services and mobile key technology. Mr. Monty J. Bennett is chairman and chief executive officer of Ashford Inc. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. 
BUSINESS STRATEGIES
Based on our primary business objectives and forecasted operating conditions, our current key priorities and financial strategies include, among other things:

• | acquisition of hotel properties that will be accretive to our portfolio;


• | disposition of non-core hotel properties;


• | pursuing capital market activities to enhance long-term stockholder value;


• | preserving capital, enhancing liquidity, and continuing current cost saving measures;


• | implementing selective capital improvements designed to increase profitability and to maintain the quality of our assets;


• | implementing effective asset management strategies to minimize operating costs and increase revenues;

4


• | financing or refinancing hotels on competitive terms;


• | utilizing hedges and derivatives to mitigate risks; and


• | making other investments or divestitures that our board of directors deems appropriate.

While our current investment strategy is focused on direct hotel investments, as the business cycle and the hotel markets continue to change, we may invest in a variety of lodging-related assets based upon our evaluation of diverse market conditions including our cost of capital and the expected returns from those investments. Our investments may include: (i) direct hotel investments; (ii) mezzanine financing through origination or acquisition; (iii) first-lien mortgage financing through origination or acquisition; (iv) sale-leaseback transactions; and (v) other hospitality transactions.
Our strategy is designed to take advantage of lodging industry conditions and adjust to changes in market circumstances over time. Our assessment of market conditions will determine asset reallocation strategies. While we seek to capitalize on favorable market fundamentals, conditions beyond our control may have an impact on overall profitability and our investment returns. We will continue to seek ways to benefit from the cyclical nature of the hotel industry. 
Combining lodging-related equity and debt investments seeks, among other things, to:

• | capitalize on both current yield and price appreciation, while simultaneously offering diversification of types of assets within the hospitality industry; and


• | vary investments across an array of hospitality assets to take advantage of market cycles for each asset class.

To take full advantage of future investment opportunities in the lodging industry, we intend to invest according to the asset allocation strategies described below. However, due to ongoing changes in market conditions, we will continually evaluate the appropriateness of our investment strategies. Our board of directors may change any or all of these strategies at any time without stockholder approval or notice.
Direct Hotel Investments—In selecting hotels to acquire, we target hotels that offer either a high current return or the opportunity to increase in value through repositioning, capital investments, market-based recovery, or improved management practices. Our direct hotel acquisition strategy primarily targets full-service upscale and upper upscale hotels with RevPAR less than twice the national average in primary, secondary, and resort markets, typically throughout the U.S and will seek to achieve both current income and appreciation. In addition, we will continue to assess our existing hotel portfolio and make strategic decisions to sell certain under-performing or non-strategic hotels that do not fit our investment strategy or criteria due to micro or macro market changes or other reasons.
Mezzanine Financing—Subordinated loans, or mezzanine loans, that we acquire or originate may relate to a diverse segment of hotels that are located across the U.S. These mezzanine loans are secured by junior mortgages on hotels or pledges of equity interests in entities owning hotels. In certain market conditions, we may refocus our efforts on the acquisition or origination of mezzanine loans. Given the greater repayment risks of these types of loans, to the extent we acquire or originate them in the future, we seek to have a more conservative approach in underwriting these assets. Mezzanine loans that we acquire in the future may be secured by individual assets as well as cross-collateralized portfolios of assets.
First Mortgage Financing—From time to time, we may acquire or originate first mortgages. When dynamics in the capital markets and the hotel industry make first-mortgage investments more attractive, we may acquire, potentially at a discount to par, or originate loans secured by first priority mortgages on hotels. We may be subject to certain state-imposed licensing regulations related to commercial mortgage lenders, with which we intend to comply. However, because we are not a bank or a federally chartered lending institution, we are not subject to state and federal regulatory constraints imposed on such entities.
Sale-Leaseback Transactions—To date, we have not participated in any sale-leaseback transactions of hotel properties. However, if the lodging industry fundamentals shift such that sale-leaseback transactions become more attractive investments, we may purchase hotels and lease them back to their existing hotel owners.
Other Transactions—We may also invest in other lodging related assets or businesses that offer diversification, attractive risk adjusted returns, and/or capital allocation benefits.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We currently operate in one business segment within the hotel lodging industry: direct hotel investments. A discussion of our operating segment is incorporated by reference to note 19 to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

FINANCING STRATEGY
We utilize debt to increase equity returns. When evaluating our future level of indebtedness and making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, our board of directors considers a number of factors, including:

• | our leverage levels across the portfolio;


• | the purchase price of our investments to be acquired with debt financing;


• | impact on financial covenants;


• | cost of debt;


• | loan maturity schedule;


• | the estimated market value of our investments upon refinancing;


• | the ability of particular investments, and our Company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service; and


• | trailing twelve months net operating income of the hotel to be financed.

We may incur debt in the form of purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties, publicly or privately placed debt instruments, or financing from banks, institutional investors, or other lenders. Any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured by mortgages or other interests in our properties. This indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse, or cross-collateralized. If recourse, such recourse may include our general assets or be limited to the particular investment to which the indebtedness relates. In addition, we may invest in properties or loans subject to existing loans secured by mortgages or similar liens on the properties, or we may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. We may also from time to time receive additional capital from our advisor in the form of enhanced return funding pursuant to our Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement with Ashford LLC.
We may use the proceeds from any borrowings for working capital, consistent with industry practice, to:

• | purchase interests in partnerships or joint ventures;


• | finance the origination or purchase of debt investments; or


• | finance acquisitions, expand, redevelop or improve existing properties, or develop new properties or other uses.

In addition, if we do not have sufficient cash available, we may need to borrow to meet taxable income distribution requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. No assurances can be given that we will obtain additional financings or, if we do, what the amount and terms will be. Our failure to obtain future financing under favorable terms could adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, we may selectively pursue debt financing on our individual properties and debt investments.
DISTRIBUTION POLICY
In December 2018, the board of directors approved our dividend policy for 2019 and we expect to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share on our common stock and operating partnership units during 2019. No assurance can be given that our dividend policy, including our dividend policy for 2019, will not change in the future. The adoption of a dividend policy does not commit our board of directors to declare future dividends or the amount thereof. The board of directors will continue to review our dividend policy on a quarterly basis. In December 2017, the board of directors approved our dividend policy for 2018 with an annualized target of $0.48 per share on our common stock and operating partnership units. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we declared annual dividends of $0.48 per share on our common stock and operating partnership units. We may incur indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on REITs under the Internal Revenue Code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from our investments are insufficient to fund required distributions. We may elect to pay dividends on our common stock in cash or a combination of cash and shares of securities as permitted under federal income tax laws governing REIT distribution requirements. We may pay dividends in excess of our cash flow.
Distributions are authorized by our board of directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors deemed relevant by our directors. No assurance can be given that our dividend policy, including our dividend policy for 2019, will not change in the future. The adoption of a dividend policy does not commit our board of directors to declare future dividends or the amount thereof. The board of directors will continue to review our dividend policy on at least a quarterly basis. Our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders will depend, in part, upon our receipt of distributions from our operating partnership. This, in turn, may depend upon receipt of lease payments with respect to our properties from indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and the management of our properties by our property managers. Distributions to our stockholders are generally taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income. However, since a portion of our investments are equity ownership interests in hotels, which result in depreciation and non-cash charges against our income, a portion of our distributions may constitute a non-taxable return of capital, to the extent of a stockholder’s tax basis in the stock. To the extent that it is consistent with maintaining our REIT status, we may maintain accumulated earnings of Ashford TRS in that entity.

Our charter allows us to issue preferred stock with a preference on distributions, such as our Series D, Series F, Series G, Series H and Series I preferred stock. The partnership agreement of our operating partnership also allows the operating partnership to issue units with a preference on distributions. The issuance of these series of preferred stock and units together with any similar issuance in the future, given the dividend preference on such stock or units, could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to our common stockholders.
COMPETITION
The hotel industry is highly competitive and the hotels in which we invest are subject to competition from other hotels for guests. Competition is based on a number of factors, most notably convenience of location, availability of rooms, brand affiliation, price, range of services, guest amenities or accommodations offered and quality of customer service. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our properties are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels. Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy rate, average daily room rate and rooms revenue per available room of our hotels or may require us to make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, which may result in decreases in our profitability.
Our principal competitors include other hotel operating companies, ownership companies and national and international hotel brands. We face increased competition from providers of less expensive accommodations, such as select-service hotels or independent owner-managed hotels, during periods of economic downturn when leisure and business travelers become more sensitive to room rates. We also experience competition from alternative types of accommodations such as home sharing companies.
EMPLOYEES
We have no employees. Our appointed officers are provided by Ashford LLC, a subsidiary of Ashford Inc. (collectively, our “advisor”). Services which would otherwise be provided by employees are provided by Ashford LLC and by our executive officers. Ashford LLC has approximately 116 full-time employees. These employees directly or indirectly perform various acquisition, development, asset management, capital markets, accounting, tax, risk management, legal, redevelopment, and corporate management functions pursuant to the terms of our advisory agreement.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Under various federal, state, and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on such property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Furthermore, a person who arranges for the disposal of a hazardous substance or transports a hazardous substance for disposal or treatment from property owned by another may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released into the environment at that property. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell the affected property or to borrow using the affected property as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of our properties, we, our operating partnership, or Ashford TRS may be potentially liable for any such costs. In addition, the value of any lodging property loan we originate or acquire would be adversely affected if the underlying property contained hazardous or toxic substances.
Phase I environmental assessments, which are intended to identify potential environmental contamination for which our properties may be responsible, have been obtained on substantially all of our properties. Such Phase I environmental assessments included:

• | historical reviews of the properties;


• | reviews of certain public records;


• | preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties;


• | screening for the presence of hazardous substances, toxic substances, and underground storage tanks; and


• | the preparation and issuance of a written report.

Such Phase I environmental assessments did not include invasive procedures, such as soil sampling or ground water analysis. Such Phase I environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, results of operations, or liquidity, and we are not aware of any such liability. To the extent Phase I environmental assessments reveal facts that require further investigation, we would perform a Phase II environmental assessment. However, it is possible that these environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities. There may be material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware, including environmental liabilities that may have arisen since the environmental assessments were completed or updated. No assurances can be given that (i) future laws, ordinances, or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability, or (ii) the current environmental condition of our properties will not be 
7

affected by the condition of properties in the vicinity (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties unrelated to us.
We believe our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state, and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters. Neither we nor, to our knowledge, any of the former owners of our properties have been notified by any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability, or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our properties.
INSURANCE
We maintain comprehensive insurance, including liability, property, workers’ compensation, rental loss, environmental, terrorism, cyber security and, when available on commercially reasonable terms, flood, wind and earthquake insurance, with policy specifications, limits, and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties. Certain types of losses (for example, matters of a catastrophic nature such as acts of war or substantial known environmental liabilities) are either uninsurable or require substantial premiums that are not economically feasible to maintain. Certain types of losses, such as those arising from subsidence activity, are insurable only to the extent that certain standard policy exceptions to insurability are waived by agreement with the insurer. We believe, however, that our properties are adequately insured, consistent with industry standards.
FRANCHISE LICENSES
We believe that the public’s perception of quality associated with a franchisor can be an important feature in the operation of a hotel. Franchisors provide a variety of benefits for franchisees, which include national advertising, publicity, and other marketing programs designed to increase brand awareness, training of personnel, continuous review of quality standards, and centralized reservation systems.
As of December 31, 2018, we owned interests in 119 hotel properties, 112 of which operated under the following franchise licenses or brand management agreements:

Our management companies, including Remington Lodging, must operate each hotel pursuant to the terms of the related franchise or brand management agreement and must use their best efforts to maintain the right to operate each hotel pursuant to such terms. In the event of termination of a particular franchise or brand management agreement, our management companies must operate any affected hotels under another franchise or brand management agreement, if any, that we enter into. We anticipate that many of the additional hotels we acquire could be operated under franchise licenses or brand management agreements as well.
Our franchise licenses and brand management agreements generally specify certain management, operational, recordkeeping, accounting, reporting, and marketing standards and procedures with which the franchisee or brand operator must comply, including requirements related to:

• | training of operational personnel;


• | safety;


• | maintaining specified insurance;


• | types of services and products ancillary to guestroom services that may be provided;


• | display of signage; and


• | type, quality, and age of furniture, fixtures, and equipment included in guestrooms, lobbies, and other common areas.

SEASONALITY
Our properties’ operations historically have been seasonal as certain properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the summer months, while certain other properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the winter months. This seasonality pattern can cause fluctuations in our quarterly revenue. We anticipate that our cash flows from the operations of our properties will be sufficient to enable us to make quarterly distributions to maintain our REIT status. To the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue, we expect to utilize other cash on hand or borrowings to fund required distributions. However, we cannot make any assurances that we will make distributions in the future.
ACCESS TO REPORTS AND OTHER INFORMATION
We maintain a website at www.ahtreit.com. On our website, we make available free-of-charge our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and other reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such material with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All of our filed reports can also be obtained at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, Corporate Governance Guidelines, and Board Committee Charters are also available free-of-charge on our website or can be made available in print upon request.
