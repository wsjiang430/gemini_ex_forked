Item 1. Business
Our Company
We are a bank holding company headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida, with $8.1 billion in assets, $5.9 billion in loans, $6.0 billion in deposits, $747.4 million of shareholders’ equity and $1.6 billion in assets under management and custody as of December 31, 2018. We provide individuals and businesses a comprehensive array of deposit, credit, investment, wealth management, retail banking and fiduciary services. We serve customers in our U.S. markets and select international customers. These services are offered through Amerant Bank, N.A., or the Bank, which is also headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida, and its subsidiaries. Fiduciary, investment and wealth management services are provided by the Bank’s national trust company subsidiary, Amerant Trust, N.A., or Amerant Trust, and the Bank’s securities broker-dealer subsidiary, Amerant Investments, Inc., or Amerant Investments. We call these services and entities wealth management.
The Bank was founded in 1979 and is the largest community bank headquartered in Florida. We currently operate 23 banking centers where we offer personal and commercial banking services. The Bank’s primary markets are South Florida, where we operate 15 banking centers in the Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties; the greater Houston, Texas area, where we have eight banking centers that serve nearby areas of Harris, Montgomery, Fort Bend and Waller counties; a loan production office, or LPO, recently opened in Dallas, Texas; and a LPO in New York, New York. We currently have 911 FTEs throughout our markets. We have no foreign offices.
Our History
From 1987 through December 31, 2017, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mercantil Servicios Financieros, C.A., which we refer to as MSF. On March 15, 2018, MSF transferred 100% of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, together, the Company Shares, to a newly created Florida common law, non-discretionary, grantor trust, which we refer to as the Distribution Trust or the Trust. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence.”
On August 10, 2018, we completed our spin-off from MSF, or Spin-off, through the distribution, or Distribution, of 19,814,992 shares of our Class A common stock and 14,218,596 shares of our Class B common stock in each case adjusted for a stock split completed on October 24, 2018. The shares distributed in the Distribution, or Distributed Shares, constituted 80.1% of the total issued and outstanding Company Shares of each class. As a result of the Distribution, each holder of record of MSF’s Class A common stock or Class B common stock on April 2, 2018 received one share of our Class A common stock or one share of our Class B common stock for each share of MSF Class A common stock or Class B common stock, respectively.
The Distributed Shares were registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on Form 10, or the Spin-off Registration Statement. Except for Company Shares held by our affiliates, including Company Shares held in the Distribution Trust on behalf of MSF, the Distributed Shares were freely transferable.
Following the Spin-off, MSF retained 19.9% of our Class A common stock, the Class A Retained Shares, and 19.9% of our Class B common stock, the Class B Retained Shares, in the Distribution Trust,. We call the Class A Retained Shares and the Class B Retained Shares, collectively, the Retained Shares.
The Company Shares began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on August 13, 2018.

On December 21, 2018, we completed an initial public offering, the IPO, of 6,300,000 shares of Class A common stock. MSF sold all 4,922,477 shares of its Class A Retained Shares in the IPO. We received no proceeds from MSF’s sale of its Class A Retained Shares in the IPO. We sold 1,377,523 shares of our Class A common stock in the IPO and used all of the proceeds we received to repurchase 1,420,135.66 Class B Retained Shares from MSF. 
At December 31, 2018, MSF beneficially owned less than 5% of all of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve, determined that MSF no longer controlled the Company for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.
On January 23, 2019, we sold an additional 229,019 shares of our Class A common stock when the underwriters in the IPO completed the partial exercise of their over-allotment option which was granted in connection with the IPO. 
In January and February of 2019, we completed private placements whereby we issued and sold 1,903,846 shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to a series of stock purchase agreements. On February 28, 2019, we used the proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option and the private placements to repurchase from MSF all of the remaining Class B Retained Shares. Following this repurchase, MSF no longer owns any Company Shares.
Our Class A common stock and Class B common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbols “AMTB” and “AMTBB,” respectively.
New Brand
We are rebranding our Company as Amerant. We believe our new name and logo will identify us as separate and distinct from MSF and promote our strategic focus as a community bank with its own identity. All the entities in our organization are adopting the new name and logo, and the Company will formally change its name, subject to shareholders approval, following our 2019 annual shareholders’ meeting. We changed the Nasdaq Global Select Market trading symbols for our Class A common stock and Class B common stock to “AMTB” and “AMTBB,” respectively, to reflect the new brand.
Our Segments
We report our results of operations through four segments: Personal and Commercial Banking, or PAC, Corporate LATAM, Treasury and Institutional.
The PAC segment represents the largest contributor to our results in terms of loan and deposit volumes and income, representing, among others, the following businesses: CRE, middle market, commercial (both domestic and international), small business and personal, family and household clients (both domestic and international). This segment is supported by the Bank’s 15 banking centers in Florida, eight in Texas and two LPOs, one in New York, New York, and one in Dallas, Texas, which we recently opened, along with a wide array of products and services offered by the Bank. 
Corporate LATAM serves Tier 1 financial institutions and a select number of companies in the target countries of Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico. Corporate LATAM customers generally have over $1.0 billion in annual sales and operate in several large industries.

Treasury manages certain elements of the Bank’s balance sheet, including liquidity, duration, economic values and general asset/liability management, or ALM. Therefore, it derives a significant portion of its results from its securities portfolio management activities. These activities seek to maintain an adequate combination of profitability, liquidity, interest risk and credit risk in the Bank’s investment portfolio in support of our overall strategic goals, including capital preservation. Through the timing of its purchases and sales to achieve these objectives, Treasury historically has also generated revenue during volatile economic periods. In addition, Treasury, together with PAC, participates in the offering of derivative instruments to our borrowers seeking to hedge changes in their loan interest rates.
The activities of our Institutional segment relate to institutional or corporate overhead activities, including those of Amerant Trust and Amerant Investments. 
Our Markets
Our primary market areas are South Florida, the greater Houston, Texas and the greater New York City area, especially the five New York City boroughs. We serve our market areas from our headquarters in Coral Gables, Florida, and through a network of 15 banking locations in South Florida and eight banking locations in the greater Houston, Texas area. We also maintain a LPO in New York, New York that focuses on originating CRE loans, and a LPO in Dallas, Texas that originates all types of commercial loans. As part of our strategic plan, in addition to expansion in our domestic market areas, we may further diversify our markets through entry into other large metropolitan markets, especially in other major cities in Texas. Expansion may include LPOs and banking centers.
Credit Policies and Procedures
General. We adhere to what we believe are disciplined underwriting standards. We maintain asset quality through an emphasis on local market knowledge, long-term customer relationships, consistent and thorough underwriting for all loans and a conservative credit culture. We also seek to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio across geographies, customers, products and industries. Our lending policies do not provide for any loans that are highly speculative, subprime, or that have high loan-to-value ratios. These components, together with active credit management, are the foundation of our credit culture, which we believe is critical to enhancing the long-term value of our organization to our customers, employees, shareholders and communities. 
Credit Concentrations. In connection with the management of our credit portfolio, we actively manage the composition of our loan portfolio, including credit concentrations. Our loan approval policies establish concentration limits with respect to industry and loan product type to ensure portfolio diversification, which are reviewed at least annually. The CRE concentration limits include sub-limits by type of property and geographic market, which are reviewed semi-annually. Country limits for loans to foreign borrowers are also assessed semi-annually. In general, all concentration levels are monitored on a monthly basis.
Loan Approval Process. We seek to achieve an appropriate balance between prudent and disciplined underwriting and flexibility in our decision-making and responsiveness to our customers. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had a legal lending limit of approximately $132.6 million for unsecured loans, and its “in-house” single obligor lending limit was $35.0 million for CRE loans, representing 26.40% of our legal lending limit and $30.0 million for all other loans, representing 22.63% of our legal lending limit as of such date. Our credit approval policies provide the highest lending authority to our credit committee, as well as various levels of officer and senior management lending authority for new credits and renewals, which are based on position, capability and experience. These limits are reviewed periodically by the Bank’s board of directors. We believe that our credit approval process provides for thorough underwriting and sound and efficient decision making.
3


Credit Risk Management. We use what we believe is a comprehensive methodology to monitor credit quality and prudently manage credit concentrations within our loan portfolio. Our underwriting policies and practices govern the risk profile and credit and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio. We also have what we believe to be a comprehensive methodology to monitor these credit quality standards, including a risk classification system that identifies possible problem loans based on risk characteristics by loan type as well as the early identification of deterioration at the individual loan level.
Credit risk management involves a collective effort among our loan officers and credit underwriting, credit administration, credit risk and collections personnel. We conduct weekly credit committee meetings to approve loans and review any other credit related matter. Once a month, the asset quality and delinquencies are also reviewed by the committee and reports are elevated to senior management and the board of directors. Our evaluation and compensation program for our loan officers includes significant asset quality goals, such as the percentage of past due loans and charge-offs to total loans in the officer’s portfolio, that we believe motivate the loan officers to focus on the origination and maintenance of high quality credits consistent with our strategic focus on asset quality.
The Bank’s Credit Committee holds monthly meetings to discuss credit quality trends, including past due status and changes to loan performance. Our policies require rapid notification of delinquency and prompt initiation of collection actions. Loan officers, credit administration personnel and senior management proactively support collection activities.
Deposits
Our deposits serve as the primary funding source for lending, investing and other general banking purposes. We provide a full range of deposit products and services, including a variety of checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, debit cards, remote deposit capture, online banking, mobile banking, e-Statements and direct deposit services. We also offer business accounts and cash management services, including business checking and savings accounts and treasury management services for our commercial clients. We solicit deposits through our relationship-driven team of dedicated and accessible bankers and through community focused marketing. We also seek to cross-sell deposit products and services at loan origination and loans to our depository and other customers.
We utilize brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had brokered deposits of $642.1 million and $780.0 million, 10.6% and 12.34% of our total deposits at those dates, respectively.
Following the Spin-off, we have sought to continue to increase our share of domestic deposits by continuing our banking center expansion and redevelopment plans and focusing on improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Investment, Advisory and Trust Services
We offer a wide variety of trust and estate planning products and services through Amerant Trust. Catering to high net worth customers, our trust and estate planning products include simple and complex trusts; private foundations; personal investment companies and escrow accounts. Amerant Trust also acts as a U.S. fiduciary responsible for managing trust or escrow assets, provides custody services, and provides trust administrative services to MSF’s non-U.S. affiliates, including the Cayman Bank, which we plan to acquire from MSF, as discussed below. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence.” Amerant Trust’s wholly-owned subsidiary, CTC Management Services, LLC, provides corporate and ancillary administrative services for Amerant Trust’s fiduciary relationships.
4


We also offer brokerage and investment advisory services in global capital markets through Amerant Investments, which is a member of FINRA, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and a registered investment adviser with the SEC. Amerant Investments acts as an introducing broker-dealer through Pershing (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon) to obtain clearing, custody and other ancillary services. Amerant Investments offers a wide range of products, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, equity securities, fixed income securities, structured products, discretionary portfolio management, margin lending and online equities trading. Amerant Investments has distribution agreements with many major U.S. and international asset managers, as well as with some focused boutique providers. Amerant Investments provides its services to the Bank’s U.S. domestic and international customers mainly in the PAC segment. The Bank’s retail customers are offered non-FDIC insured investment products and services exclusively through Amerant Investments.
MSF indirectly, through its Panama holding company, currently owns 100% of Mercantil Bank and Trust Limited (Cayman), or the Cayman Bank, a bank and trust company located in St. George, Grand Cayman. The Cayman Bank operates under a Cayman Offshore Bank license, or B license, and a Trust license and is supervised by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, or CIMA. The Cayman Bank has no staff and its fiduciary services and general administration are provided by the staff of Amerant Trust and the Bank, respectively, under separate agreements. Approximately 50% of our trust relationships, including those of many of our important foreign customers, employ Cayman Islands trusts and are domiciled in the Cayman Bank. The OCC periodically examines the Bank and Amerant Trust and reviews the fiduciary relationships and transactions that Amerant Trust and the Bank manage for the Cayman Bank.
We have historically operated and managed the Cayman Bank as part of our service agreements with MSF. The Cayman Bank serves a number of our trust and wealth management customers. The Bank intends to acquire the Cayman Bank from a MSF subsidiary for cash at its fair market value based on the Cayman Bank’s shareholder’s equity, adjusted to reflect income and losses to the closing date and purchase accounting adjustments, including the mark to market of all assets and liabilities at the closing date, plus a premium of $885,000. The premium is based upon a valuation of the Cayman Bank prepared for us by Hovde Group, an investment banking firm. Based on the Cayman Bank’s December 31, 2018 balance sheet, the estimated purchase price would be approximately $13.4 to $14.4 million. We anticipate that the necessary bank regulatory approvals will take 3 to 6 months to complete. The acquisition is expected to be completed promptly after the receipt of the last required bank regulatory approval. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence.”
This acquisition is subject to the negotiation of a definitive agreement and the receipt of necessary Federal Reserve and CIMA regulatory approvals. Prior to the completion of the acquisition, we expect to continue the existing fiduciary services and general administrative services agreements with Amerant Trust and the Bank, subject to any regulatory requirement. The continuation of these services, as well as the continued and sole designation of our officers and directors, including Mr. Wilson, as officers or directors of the Cayman Bank will protect our customers’ interests pending the proposed acquisition. 
Other Products and Services
We offer banking products and services that we believe are attractively priced with a focus on customer convenience and accessibility. We offer a full suite of online banking services including access to account balances, online transfers, online bill payment and electronic delivery of customer statements, as well as ATMs, and banking by mobile device, telephone and mail. Many of the services provided in our online platform are also available via our mobile application for smart devices. We also offer debit cards, credit cards to our international customers, night depository, direct deposit, cashier’s checks, safe deposit boxes in various locations and letters of credit, as well as treasury management services, including wire transfer services, remote deposit capture and automated clearinghouse services. In addition, we offer interest rate swap contracts to our most sophisticated commercial real estate lending customers.

Investments
Our investment policy, set by our board of directors, requires that investment decisions are made based on, but not limited to, the following four principles: investment quality, liquidity requirements, interest-rate risk sensitivity and estimated return on investment. These characteristics are pillars of our investment decision-making process, which seeks to minimize exposure to risks while providing a reasonable yield and liquidity. The investment policy is carried out by Treasury in coordination with ALCO. Under the direction of ALCO and Treasury, the Bank employees have delegated authority to invest in securities within specified policy guidelines.
Information Technology Systems
We continue to make significant investments in our information technology systems for our deposit and lending operations and treasury management activities. We believe that these investments, including additional technology changes to implement our strategic plan, are essential to increase our overall customer experience, to support our compliance, internal controls and efficiencies, to enhance our capabilities to offer new products, and to provide scale for future growth and acquisitions. We license our core data processing platform from a nationally recognized bank software vendor, which provides us with essential functionalities to support our continued growth. Our internal network and the majority of key applications are maintained in-house. The scalability of our infrastructure is designed to support our expansion strategy. In addition, we leverage the capabilities of third-party service providers to augment the technical capabilities and expertise that is required for us to operate as an effective and efficient organization. We believe our management of these third-party relationships complies with FFIEC’s guidelines.
The Bank is actively engaged in identifying and managing cybersecurity risks. Protecting company data, non-public customer and employee data, and the systems that collect, process, and maintain this information is deemed critical. The Bank has an enterprise-wide Information Security Program, or Security Program, which is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer non-public information and bank data. The Security Program is designed to protect our operations and assets through a continuous and comprehensive cybersecurity detection, protection and prevention program. This program includes an information security governance structure and related policies and procedures, security controls, protocols governing data and systems, monitoring processes, and processes to ensure that the information security programs of third-party service providers are adequate. Our Security Program also continuously promotes cybersecurity awareness and culture across the organization.
The Bank also has a business continuity plan, which it actively manages to prepare for any business continuity challenges it may face. Our business continuity/disaster recovery plan provides for the resiliency and recovery of our operations and services to our customers. The plan is supported and complemented by a robust business continuity governance framework, a life safety program as well as an enterprise-wide annual exercise and training to keep the program and strategies effective, scalable and understood by all employees. We believe both the Security Program and business continuity programs adhere to industry best practices and comply with the FFIEC’s guidelines, and are subject to periodic testing and independent audits.
Competition
The banking and financial services industry is highly competitive, and we compete with a wide range of lenders and other financial institutions within our markets, including local, regional, national and international commercial banks and credit unions. We also compete with mortgage companies, brokerage firms, trust service providers, consumer finance companies, mutual funds, securities firms, insurance companies, third-party payment processors, fintech companies and other financial intermediaries on various of our products and services. Some of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions and level of regulatory supervision applicable to us.
6


Interest rates on loans and deposits, as well as prices on fee-based services, are typically significant competitive factors within the banking and financial services industry. Many of our competitors are much larger financial institutions that have greater financial resources than we do and compete aggressively for market share. These competitors attempt to gain market share through their financial product mix, pricing strategies and larger banking center networks. Other important competitive factors in our industry and markets include office locations and hours, quality of customer service, community reputation, continuity of personnel and services, capacity and willingness to extend credit, electronic delivery systems and ability to offer sophisticated banking products and services. While we seek to remain competitive with respect to fees charged, interest rates and pricing, we believe that our broad and sophisticated commercial banking product suite, our high-quality customer service culture, our positive reputation and long-standing community relationships enable us to compete successfully within our markets and enhance our ability to attract and retain customers.
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 911 FTEs. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be very good and monitor these through annual employee engagement surveys. The Bank has earned an AON’s Regional “Best Employer” award in the last three years. This award recognizes those organization that have made an extraordinary effort to gain a competitive advantage through their people and, in doing so, become employers of choice.
Other Subsidiaries
Intermediate Holding Company
The Company owns the Bank through our wholly-owned, intermediate holding company, Mercantil Florida Bancorp Inc., or Mercantil Florida. Mercantil Florida is the obligor under the $118.1 million aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated debentures related to our outstanding trust preferred securities. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Mercantil Florida had cash and cash equivalents of $32.9 million and $39.1 million, respectively.
Voting Trust
In October 2008, MSF, the Company and various individuals as Voting Trustees, entered into a Voting Trust Agreement, which we call the Voting Trust. The Voting Trust was amended and restated in 2017. 
The Voting Trust was organized under the laws of Florida and was a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. It held all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Mercantil Florida, which is the Bank’s immediate parent and sole shareholder. The Voting Trust was a “company” subject to supervision and regulation under the BHC Act. The Voting Trust had issued Voting Trust certificates representing the entire interest in the Voting Trust to the Company. In the event of Control Changes in MSF, the Voting Trustees, could cancel the existing Voting Trust certificates and distribute these to MSF’s shareholders pro rata to preserve the Bank and MSF’s shareholders’ economic interests in the Bank. No Control Change had occurred prior to July 24, 2018.
The Voting Trust was terminated on July 24, 2018. The Spin-off made the Voting Trust unnecessary.
7


The REIT
Through the Bank’s subsidiary, CB Reit Holding Corporation, or REIT Hold Co., we maintain a real estate investment trust, CB Real Estate Investments, or REIT, which is taxed as a real estate investment trust. The REIT holds various of the Bank’s real estate loans, and allows the Bank to better manage the Bank’s real estate portfolio. The REIT’s outstanding common stock is owned entirely by REIT Hold Co. Of the REIT’s 1,250 issued and outstanding 6.00% preferred shares (par value $750), 1,125 are owned by REIT Hold Co. and 122 are owned by different employees of the Bank.
Dividend Restrictions
As a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is affected by the policies and enforcement powers of the Federal Reserve. In addition, because we are a bank holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends by the Bank to us as our principal source of funds to pay dividends in the future, if any, and to make other payments. The Bank is also subject to various legal, regulatory and other restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and make other distributions and payments to us. For further information, see “Supervision and Regulation-Payment of Dividends.”
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
We and the Bank are extensively regulated under U.S. Federal and state laws applicable to financial institutions. Our supervision, regulation and examination are primarily intended to protect depositors, and maintain the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the federal deposit insurance fund generally. Such supervision and regulation are not intended to protect the holders of our capital stock and other securities issued by us. Any change in applicable law or regulation may have a material effect on our business. The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions referred to below.
Bank Holding Company Regulation
The Company is a bank holding company, subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. Bank holding companies generally are limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and certain related activities. We are required to file periodic reports and other information with the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve examines us and our non-bank subsidiaries.
The BHC Act requires prior Federal Reserve approval for, among other things, the acquisition by a bank holding company of direct or indirect ownership or “control” of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all the assets of any bank, or for a merger or consolidation of a bank holding company with another bank holding company. With certain exceptions, the BHC Act prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or “control” of voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than banking or managing or controlling banks or performing services for its authorized subsidiaries. A bank holding company may, however, engage in or acquire an interest in a company that engages in activities that the Federal Reserve has determined by regulation, or order, to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

Bank holding companies that are and remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed,” as defined in Federal Reserve Regulation Y, and whose insured depository institution subsidiaries maintain “satisfactory” or better ratings under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”), may elect to become “financial holding companies.” Financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are permitted to acquire or engage in activities such as insurance underwriting, securities underwriting, travel agency activities, broad insurance agency activities, merchant banking and other activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be financial in nature or complementary thereto. In addition, under the BHC Act’s merchant banking authority and Federal Reserve regulations, financial holding companies are authorized to invest in companies that engage in activities that are not financial in nature, as long as the financial holding company makes its investment with the intention of limiting the terms of its investment, does not manage the company on a day-to-day basis, and the investee company does not cross-market with any depositary institutions controlled by the financial holding company. Financial holding companies continue to be subject to Federal Reserve supervision, regulation and examination, but the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”) applies the concept of functional regulation to the activities conducted by their subsidiaries. For example, insurance activities would be subject to supervision and regulation by state insurance authorities. The Federal Reserve recommended repeal of the merchant banking powers in its September 16, 2016 study pursuant to Section 620 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company, but it may elect to do so in the future. 
The BHC Act permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies, subject to various restrictions, including that the acquirer is “well capitalized” and “well managed”. A national bank located in Florida, with the prior approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), may acquire and operate one or more banks in other states pursuant to a transaction in which the bank is the surviving bank. In addition, national banks located in Florida may enter into a merger transaction with one or more out-of-state banks, and an out-of-state bank resulting from such transaction may continue to operate the acquired branches in Florida. The Dodd-Frank Act permits banks, including national banks, to branch anywhere in the United States.
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Various legal limitations restrict the Bank from lending or otherwise supplying funds to us. We and the Bank are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W thereunder. 
Section 23A defines “covered transactions,” which include extensions of credit, and limits a bank’s covered transactions with any affiliate to 10% of such bank’s capital and surplus. All covered and exempt transactions between a bank and its affiliates must be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and banks and their subsidiaries are prohibited from purchasing low-quality assets from the bank’s affiliates. Finally, Section 23A requires that all of a bank’s extensions of credit to its affiliates be appropriately secured by permissible collateral, generally U.S. government or agency securities. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act generally requires covered and other transactions among affiliates to be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same as or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiary as those prevailing at the time for similar transactions with unaffiliated companies.

Federal Reserve policy and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, require a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its FDIC-insured bank subsidiaries. These may require bank holding companies to support their bank subsidiaries with additional investments, including in situations where additional investments in the bank subsidiary may not otherwise be warranted. In the event an FDIC-insured subsidiary becomes subject to a capital restoration plan with its regulators, the parent bank holding company is required to guarantee performance of such plan up to 5% of the bank’s assets, and such guarantee is given priority in bankruptcy of the bank holding company. In addition, where a bank holding company has more than one bank or thrift subsidiary, each of the bank holding company’s subsidiary depository institutions may be held responsible for any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF, if an affiliated depository institution fails. As a result, a bank holding company may be required to loan money to a bank subsidiary in the form of subordinate capital notes or other instruments which qualify as capital under bank regulatory rules. However, any loans from the holding company to such subsidiary banks likely will be unsecured and subordinated to such bank’s depositors and to other creditors of the bank. See “-Capital.”
Relationship with MSF
We were a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of MSF from 1987 until August 2018. MSF was a “bank holding company” under the BHC Act as a result of its control of the Company and the Bank, and was also a “foreign banking organization”, or FBO, as a result of its control of the Bank. MSF distributed 80.1% of our Class A and Class B common stock to its shareholders in the Spin-off on August 10, 2018. MSF sold all its remaining Company Class A voting stock in the Company’s IPO that closed on December 21, 2018. The Company used IPO proceeds to repurchase Class B non-voting common stock from MSF on December 28, 2018, reducing MSF’s holding in Class B common stock to less than 5% of the Company’s total common stock capital.
The Federal Reserve determined that MSF no longer “controlled” the Company or the Bank as of year-end 2018 and, therefore, was no longer a bank holding company or FBO subject to Federal Reserve supervision or regulation.
MSF made several commitments to the Federal Reserve in furtherance of the Company’s separation and to avoid potential issues under the “Joint Agency Statement on Parallel-Owned Banking Organizations” (April 23, 2001), or the “Parallel Banking Policy Statement”. MSF and its subsidiaries committed to the Federal Reserve that they would not, directly or indirectly engage in, or be a party to, any business transaction or relationship (including, without limitation, any receipt of funds as a depository) with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding this limitation, MSF may engage in the following transactions:

• | Certain limited existing business and transitional service relationships existing in December 2018;


• | The acquisition by the Bank of the Cayman Bank, an indirect MSF subsidiary, subject to any required regulatory approvals; and


• | The lease of space at market rates by the Company to MSF to house certain MSF employees who perform treasury services.

The Company has policies and procedures that are designed to reduce risk, and to properly govern remaining relationships with MSF and its subsidiaries. The Bank’s relations with MSF and its subsidiaries are currently treated as related party transactions, which are subject to review and approval by our Audit Committee.

Bank Regulation
The Bank is a national bank subject to regulation and regular examinations by the OCC, and is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. OCC regulations govern permissible activities, capital requirements, branching, dividend limitations, investments, loans and other matters. Under the Bank Merger Act, prior OCC approval is required for a national bank to merge or consolidate with, or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of, another bank. In reviewing applications to approve mergers and other acquisition transactions, the OCC is required to consider factors similar to the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act, including the applicant’s financial and managerial resources, competitive effects and public benefits of the transaction, the applicant’s performance in meeting community needs, and the effectiveness of the entities in combating money laundering activities.
The Bank is a member of the FDIC’s DIF and its deposits are insured by the FDIC to the fullest extent permitted by law. As a result, it is subject to regulation and deposit insurance assessments by the FDIC. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bank also is subject to regulations issued by the CFPB, with respect to consumer financial services and products, but is not subject to the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) supervision or examination because the Bank has less than $10 billion of assets. See “-FDIC Insurance Assessments”.
The OCC has adopted the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s (“FFIEC”) Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System, which assigns each financial institution a confidential composite “CAMELS” rating based on an evaluation and rating of six essential components of an institution’s financial condition and operations: Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity to market risk, as well as the quality of risk management practices. For most institutions, the FFIEC has indicated that market risk primarily reflects exposures to changes in interest rates, and the ability to manage market risk.
Evaluations of the component areas of the CAMELs rating take into consideration the institution’s size and sophistication, the nature and complexity of its activities, its risk profile, and the adequacy of its capital and earnings in relation to its level of market risk exposure. Market risk is rated based upon, but not limited to, an assessment of the sensitivity of the financial institution’s earnings or the economic value of its capital to adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices, management’s ability to identify, measure, monitor, and control the risks of its operations and the nature and complexity of interest rate risk exposure arising from non-trading positions. The OCC considers anti-money laundering / Bank Secrecy Act, or AML/BSA, examination findings in a safety and soundness context when assigning the management component rating. Serious deficiencies in a bank’s AML/BSA compliance create a presumption that the management rating will be adversely affected because risk management practices are less than satisfactory.
Composite ratings are based on an evaluation of an institution’s managerial, operational, financial, and compliance performance. The composite CAMELS rating is not an arithmetical formula or rigid weighting of numerical component ratings. Elements of subjectivity and examiner judgment, especially as these relate to qualitative assessments, are important elements in assigning ratings.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or the GLB Act, and related regulations require banks and their affiliated companies to adopt and disclose privacy policies, including policies regarding the sharing of personal information with third-parties. The GLB Act also permits bank subsidiaries to engage in “financial activities” similar to those permitted to financial holding companies. In December 2015, Congress amended the GLB Act as part of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act. This amendment provided financial institutions that meet certain conditions an exemption to the requirement to deliver an annual privacy notice. On August 10, 2018, the CFPB announced that it had finalized conforming amendments to its implementing regulation, Regulation P.

A variety of federal and state privacy laws govern the collection, safeguarding, sharing and use of customer information, and require that financial institutions have policies regarding information privacy and security. Some state laws also protect the privacy of information of state residents and require adequate security of such data, and certain state laws may, in some circumstances, require us to notify affected individuals of security breaches of computer databases that contain their personal information. These laws may also require us to notify law enforcement, regulators or consumer reporting agencies in the event of a data breach, as well as businesses and governmental agencies that own data.
The Bank maintains LPOs in New York City and Dallas, Texas. LPOs may only engage in certain functions on behalf of the Bank, such as soliciting loans (including assembling credit information, property inspections and appraisals, securing title information, preparing loan applications, solicitation loan servicing), and acting as a liaison with customers of the Bank. Loans and credit extensions cannot be approved by a LPO. Our LPO offices also solicit deposits, provide information about deposit products, and assist customers in completing deposit account opening documents. The LPOs are not “branches” under applicable OCC regulations and cannot engage in general banking transactions, deposit taking and withdrawals, or lending money. The LPOs are subject to supervision and examination by the OCC.
Community Reinvestment Act and Consumer Laws
The Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) and the OCC’s regulations thereunder. Under the CRA, all FDIC-insured institutions have a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with their safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA requires a depository institution’s primary federal regulator, in connection with its examination of the institution, to assess the institution’s record of assessing and meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that institution, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The bank regulatory agency’s assessment of the institution’s record is made available to the public. Further, such assessment is required of any institution that has applied to:

• | charter a national bank;


• | establish new branch offices (banking centers) that accept deposits;


• | relocate an office;


• | merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution; or


• | obtain deposit insurance coverage for a newly chartered institution.

The CRA performance of a banking organization’s depository institution subsidiaries is considered by the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in connection with bank holding company and bank mergers and acquisitions, and branch applications. When considering BHC Act applications, the Federal Reserve will assess the performance of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bank holding company, and such performance may be the basis for denying the application. A less than satisfactory CRA rating will slow, if not preclude, acquisitions, and new banking centers and other expansion activities and will prevent a company from becoming a financial holding company.
As a result of the GLB Act, CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual CRA reports must be made. The federal CRA regulations require that evidence of discriminatory, illegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation.
12


On August 28, 2018, the OCC proposed rulemaking to modernize the regulatory framework implementing the CRA. The proposal seeks comments on ways to increase lending and services to people in low- and moderate-income areas and clarify and expand the types of activities eligible for CRA consideration. The OCC shares responsibility for enforcing the rules with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Even though the Federal Reserve did not join the OCC in the publication of its proposed rulemaking concerning revisions to the CRA regulations, it is considering ideas regarding modernizing the CRA, tailoring the CRA regulations for banks of different sizes and improving the consistency and predictability of CRA evaluations and ratings.
The Bank is also subject to, among other things, fair lending laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”) and the Fair Housing Act, both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, sex and familial status in any aspect of a consumer or commercial credit or residential real estate transaction. The Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the federal bank regulators have issued an Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination in Lending to provide guidance to financial institutions in determining whether discrimination exists, how the agencies will respond to lending discrimination, and what steps lenders might take to prevent discriminatory lending practices. The DOJ has prosecuted what it regards as violations of the ECOA and Fair Housing Act, and the fair lending laws, generally.
The federal bank regulators have updated their guidance on overdrafts several times, including overdrafts incurred at automated teller machines (“ATMs”) and point of sale (“POS”) terminals. Overdrafts have become a focus of the CFPB. Among other things, the federal regulators require banks to monitor accounts and to limit the use of overdrafts by customers as a form of short-term, high-cost credit, including, for example, giving customers who overdraw their accounts on more than six occasions where a fee is charged in a rolling 12 month period a reasonable opportunity to choose a less costly alternative and decide whether to continue with fee-based overdraft coverage. It also encourages placing appropriate daily limits on overdraft fees, and asks banks to consider eliminating overdraft fees for transactions that overdraw an account by a de minimis amount. Overdraft policies, processes, fees and disclosures are frequently the subject of litigation against banks in various jurisdictions. In May 2018, the OCC encouraged national banks to offer short-term, small-Dollar installment lending. The Federal Reserve expressed similar support for responsible small Dollar lending in its June 2018 Consumer Compliance Supervision Bulletin and recently commented on certain bank practices with respect to overdraft fees being unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The CFPB proposed on February 6, 2019 to rescind its mandatory underwriting standards for loans covered by its 2017 Payday, Vehicle Title and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans rule, and has separately proposed delaying the effectiveness of such 2017 rule.
The CFPB has the authority, previously exercised by the federal bank regulators, to adopt regulations and enforce various laws, including the ECOA, and other fair lending laws, the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, mortgage lending rules, the Truth in Savings Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Privacy of Consumer Financial Information rules. Although the CFPB does not examine or supervise banks with less than $10 billion in assets, it exercises broad authority in making rules and providing guidance that affects bank regulation in these areas and the scope of bank regulators’ consumer regulation, examination and enforcement. Banks of all sizes are affected by the CFPB’s regulations, and the precedents set by CFPB enforcement actions and interpretations. The CFPB has focused on various practices to date, including revising mortgage lending rules, overdrafts, credit card add-on products, indirect automobile lending, student lending, and payday and similar short-term lending, and has a broad mandate to regulate consumer financial products and services, whether or not offered by banks or their affiliates. On February 6, 2018, the CFPB issued for public comment proposed amendments to its payday lending rule, which rescinded provisions governing underwriting of certain loans and delayed the August 19, 2019 compliance date for the mandatory underwriting provisions of the payday lending rule.

Residential Mortgages
CFPB regulations that require lenders to determine whether a consumer has the ability to repay a mortgage loan became effective on January 10, 2014. These established certain minimum requirements for creditors when making ability to repay determinations, and provide certain safe harbors from liability for mortgages that are “qualified mortgages” and are not “higher-priced.” Generally, these CFPB regulations apply to all consumer, closed-end loans secured by a dwelling, including home-purchase loans, refinancing and home equity loans (whether first or subordinate lien). Qualified mortgages must generally satisfy detailed requirements related to product features, underwriting standards, and requirements where the total points and fees on a mortgage loan cannot exceed specified amounts or percentages of the total loan amount. Qualified mortgages must have: (1) a term not exceeding 30 years; (2) regular periodic payments that do not result in negative amortization, deferral of principal repayment, or a balloon payment; (3) and be supported with documentation of the borrower and his or her credit worthiness. We anticipate focusing our residential mortgage origination on qualified mortgages and those that meet our investors’ requirements, but we may make loans that do not meet the safe harbor requirements for “qualified mortgages.”
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018, or the “2018 Growth Act”, provides that certain residential mortgages held in portfolio by banks with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets automatically are deemed to be “qualified mortgages.” This relieves such institutions from many of the requirements to satisfy the criteria listed above for “qualified mortgages.” Mortgages meeting the “qualified mortgage” safe harbor may not have negative amortization, must follow prepayment penalty limitations included in the Truth in Lending Act, and may not have fees greater than 3% of the total value of the loan.
The Bank generally services the loans it originates, excluding those it sells. The CFPB adopted mortgage servicing standards, effective in January 2014. These include requirements regarding force-placed insurance, certain notices prior to rate adjustments on adjustable rate mortgages, and periodic disclosures to borrowers. Servicers will be prohibited from processing foreclosures when a loan modification is pending, and must wait until a loan is more than 120 days delinquent before initiating a foreclosure action. Servicers must provide borrower’s direct and ongoing access to its personnel, and provide prompt review of any loss mitigation application. Servicers must maintain accurate and accessible mortgage records for the life of a loan and until one year after the loan is paid off or transferred. These new standards are expected to increase the cost and compliance risks of servicing mortgage loans, and the mandatory delays in foreclosures could result in loss of value on collateral or the proceeds we may realize from a sale of foreclosed property.
The Federal Housing Finance Authority (the “FHFA”) updated The Federal National Mortgage Association’s, or Fannie Mae’s, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation’s, or Freddie Mac’s (individually and collectively, “GSE”), repurchase rules, including the kinds of loan defects that could lead to a repurchase request to, or alternative remedies with, the mortgage loan originator or seller. These rules became effective January 1, 2016. The FHFA also has updated these GSEs’ representations and warranties framework and announced on February 2, 2016 an independent dispute resolution, or IDR, process to allow a neutral third-party to resolve demands after the GSEs’ quality control and appeal processes have been exhausted.
14


The Bank is subject to the CFPB’s integrated disclosure rules under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, called “TRID,” for credit transactions secured by real property. The TRID rules adversely affected our mortgage originations in 2016, while we revised our systems and processes to comply with these rules. Our residential mortgage strategy, product offerings, and profitability may change as these regulations are interpreted and applied in practice, and may also change due to any restructuring of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as part of the resolution of their conservatorships. The 2018 Growth Act reduced the scope of the TRID rules by eliminating the wait time for a mortgage, if an additional creditor offers a consumer a second offer with a lower annual percentage rate. Congress encouraged federal regulators to provide better guidance on TRID in an effort to provide a clearer understanding for consumers and bankers alike. The 2018 Growth Act also provides partial exemptions from the collection, recording, and reporting requirements under Sections 304(b)(5) and (6) of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or HMDA, for those banks with fewer than 500 closed-end mortgages or less than 500 open-end lines of credit in both of the preceding two years, provided the bank’s rating under the CRA for the previous two years has been at least “satisfactory.” On August 31, 2018, the CFPB issued an interpretive and procedural rule to implement and clarify these requirements under the 2018 Growth Act. 
Other Laws and Regulations
The International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorism Funding Act of 2001 (Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act) specifies “know your customer” requirements that obligate financial institutions to take actions to verify the identity of the account holders in connection with opening an account at any U.S. financial institution. Bank regulators are required to consider compliance with anti-money laundering laws and provisions before acting upon merger and acquisition and other expansion proposals. Furthermore, significant civil and criminal monetary penalties for violations of this Act can be imposed.
New Federal Financial Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) rules, effective May 2018, require banks to know the beneficial owners of customers that are not natural persons, to update customer information to develop a customer risk profile, and generally monitor such matters.
The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or USA PATRIOT Act, subjects financial institutions to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as to enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with certain foreign financial institutions.
The USA PATRIOT Act requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs, and sets forth minimum standards, which the regulators refer to as “pillars” for these programs, including:

• | the development of internal policies, procedures, and controls;


• | the designation of a compliance officer;


• | an ongoing employee training program;


• | an independent audit function to test the programs; and


• | ongoing customer due diligence and monitoring.

The Company is also required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) and the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a newly public company, and as an emerging growth company, we are not required currently to comply with various provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. See “Summary-Emerging Growth Company Status.”
15


The Company regularly evaluates its controls, including compliance with the SEC rules on internal controls, and expects to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules. If the Company fails to comply with these internal control rules in the future, it may materially adversely affect its reputation, its ability to obtain the necessary certifications to its financial statements, its relations with its regulators and other financial institutions with which it deals, and its ability to access the capital markets and offer and sell Company securities on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company. See “Risk Factors—We may determine that our internal controls and disclosure controls could have deficiencies or weaknesses.”
Payment of Dividends
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Our primary source of cash is dividends from the Bank. Prior regulatory approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank (such as the Bank) in any calendar year will exceed the sum of such bank’s net profits for the year and its retained net earnings for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. During 2018, the Bank paid cash dividends of approximately $47.5 million, including the $40 million special dividend used to pay such amount as a dividend to MSF in connection with the Spin-off. At December 31, 2018, the Bank could have declared additional dividends of approximately $82.6 million, without prior OCC approval. 
In addition, we and the Bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. The Federal Reserve and the OCC are authorized to determine when the payment of dividends by the Company and the Bank, respectively, would be an unsafe or unsound practice, and may prohibit such dividends.
The Federal Reserve has indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank holding company’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve has indicated that depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current year’s operating earnings.
Under Federal Reserve Supervisory Letter SR-09-4 (February 24, 2009), as revised December 21, 2015, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, and the absence of potential events that could affect a company’s ability to pay a dividend while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if:

• | its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;


• | its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or


• | it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.

The Basel III Capital Rules were fully phased-in on January 1, 2019 and further limit our permissible dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses, including those of the Bank, unless we and the Bank continue to meet the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement effective January 1, 2019. The Company and the Bank exceeded the capital conservation requirement at year end 2018. See “Basel III Capital Rules.”

Capital
The Federal Reserve has risk-based capital rules for bank holding companies and the OCC has similar rules for national banks. These rules required at year end 2018 a minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) and capital conservation buffer of 9.875%. Tier 1 capital includes common equity and related retained earnings and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock, less goodwill and certain core deposit intangibles. Voting common equity must be the predominant form of capital. Tier 2 capital consists of non-qualifying preferred stock, qualifying subordinated, perpetual, and/or mandatory convertible debt, term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock, up to 45% of pre-tax unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable market values that are prudently valued, and a loan loss allowance up to 1.25% of its standardized total risk-weighted assets, excluding the allowance. We collectively refer to Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital as Total risk-based capital.
In addition, the Federal Reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies, which provide for a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average quarterly assets (“leverage ratio”) equal to 4%. However, regulators expect bank holding companies and banks to operate with leverage ratios above the minimum. The guidelines also provide that institutions experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. The Federal Reserve has indicated that the Federal Reserve will continue to consider a “tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio” (deducting all intangibles) in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activity. Higher capital may be required in individual cases and depending upon a bank holding company’s risk profile. All bank holding companies and banks are expected to hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of their risks, including the volume and severity of their problem loans. The level of Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets is becoming more widely used by the bank regulators to measure capital adequacy. Neither the Federal Reserve nor the OCC has advised us of any specific minimum leverage ratio or tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio applicable to the Company or the Bank, respectively. Under Federal Reserve policies, bank holding companies are generally expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios. The Federal Reserve believes the risk-based ratios do not fully take into account the quality of capital and interest rate, liquidity, market and operational risks. Accordingly, supervisory assessments of capital adequacy may differ significantly from conclusions based solely on the level of an organization’s risk-based capital ratio.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, among other things, requires the federal bank regulators to take “prompt corrective action” regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation.
All of the federal bank regulators also have regulations establishing risk-adjusted measures and relevant capital levels which implement the “prompt corrective action” standards applicable to banks. The relevant capital measures are the total risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, common equity Tier 1 or “CET1” capital ratio, as well as, the leverage capital ratio. Under the regulations, national banks will be:

• | Well-capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater and is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive by a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure;


• | “Adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, and generally has a leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater;

17



• | “Undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a CET1 capital ratio of less than 4.5% or generally has a leverage capital ratio of less than 2%;


• | “Significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, a CET1 capital ratio of less than 3%, or a leverage capital ratio of less than 3%; or


• | “Critically undercapitalized” if its tangible equity is equal to or less than 2% to total assets.

The federal bank regulators have authority to require additional capital.
The Dodd-Frank Act significantly modified the capital rules applicable to us and call for increased capital, generally.

• | The generally applicable prompt corrective action leverage and risk-based capital standards, or generally applicable standards, including the types of instruments that may be counted as Tier 1 capital, will be applicable on a consolidated basis to depository institution holding companies, as well as their bank and thrift subsidiaries.


• | The generally applicable standards in effect prior to the Dodd-Frank Act will be “floors” for the standards to be set by the regulators.


• | Bank and thrift holding companies with assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, will be permitted to include trust preferred securities that were issued before May 19, 2010, as Tier 1 capital, but trust preferred securities issued by a bank holding company after May 19, 2010 will no longer count as Tier 1 capital. Our trust preferred securities outstanding at December 31, 2018 were issued before May 19, 2010, and are included in our Tier 1 capital.

Information concerning our and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 is included under the heading “Regulatory Capital Requirements” in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Depository institutions that are “adequately capitalized” for bank regulatory purposes must receive a waiver from the FDIC prior to accepting or renewing brokered deposits, and cannot pay interest rates that exceed market rates by more than 75 basis points. Banks that are less than “adequately capitalized” cannot accept or renew brokered deposits. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including paying dividends) or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution thereafter would be “undercapitalized.” Institutions that are “undercapitalized” are subject to prohibitions on brokered deposits, growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan for approval. A depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and the amount necessary to bring the institution into compliance with applicable capital standards. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” If the controlling holding company fails to fulfill its obligations under FDICIA and files (or has filed against it) a petition under the federal Bankruptcy Code, the claim against the holding company’s capital restoration obligation would be entitled to a priority in such bankruptcy proceeding over third-party creditors of the bank holding company. Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized”, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.
18


The prompt corrective action rules have been conformed by the Basel III Capital Rules, as discussed below.
Basel III Capital Rules
The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the other bank regulators adopted in June 2013 final capital rules (the “Basel III Capital Rules”) for bank holding companies and banks implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s “Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for more Resilient Banks and Banking Systems.” These new U.S. capital rules are called the Basel III Capital Rules, and were generally fully phased-in on January 1, 2019.
The Basel III Capital Rules limit Tier 1 capital to common stock and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, as well as qualifying trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010, each of which are grandfathered in Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets. A new capital measure CET1, has been added by the Basel III Capital Rules. CET1 includes common stock and related surplus, retained earnings and, subject to certain adjustments, minority common equity interests in subsidiaries. CET1 is reduced by deductions for:

• | Goodwill and other intangibles, other than mortgage servicing assets, which are treated separately, net of associated deferred tax losses (“DTLs”);


• | Deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) arising from operating losses and tax credit carryforwards net of allowances and DTLs;


• | Gains on sale from any securitization exposure; and


• | Defined benefit pension fund net assets (i.e., excess plan assets), net of associated DTLs.

The Company made a one-time election in 2015, whereby CET1 will not be adjusted for certain accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”).
Additional “threshold deductions” of the following that are individually greater than 10% of CET1 or collectively greater than 15% of CET1 (after the above deductions are also made):

• | Mortgage service assets, net of associated DTLs;


• | DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, net of any valuation allowances and DTLs;


• | significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, net of associated DTLs; and


• | Noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Tier 1 minority interest not included in CET1, subject to limits, and current Tier 1 capital instruments issued to the U.S. Treasury, including shares issued pursuant to the TARP or SBLF programs, will qualify as additional Tier 1 capital (all other qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt and qualifying minority interests will be included in Tier 2 capital).

19


In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, a new “capital conservation buffer” of CET1 capital of at least 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets, will be required. The capital conservation buffer will be calculated as the lowest of:

• | the banking organization’s CET1 capital ratio minus 4.5%;


• | the banking organization’s Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio minus 6.0%; and


• | the banking organization’s total risk-based capital ratio minus 8.0%.

The capital conservation buffers and the related restrictions on permissible dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses were applicable for the first time in 2016. The capital conservation buffer of 0.625% or less became effective in 2016. In 2018, the capital conservation buffer is 1.875% or less.
Full compliance with the capital conservation buffer is required by January 1, 2019. Thereafter, permissible dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses are limited to the following percentages based on the capital conservation buffer as calculated above, subject to any further regulatory limitations, including those based on risk assessments and enforcement actions:

Buffer% | % Limit
More than 2.50% | None 
> 1.875% - 2.50% | 60.00% 
> 1.250% - 1.875% | 40.00% 
> 0.625% - 1.250% | 20.00% 
< 0.625% | 0% 

The various capital elements and total capital under the Basel III Capital Rules, as fully phased-in on January 1, 2019 are:
 | Fully Phased In January 1, 2019
Minimum CET1 | 4.50% 
Capital Conservation Buffer | 2.50% 
Total CET1 | 7.00% 
Deductions from CET1 | 100.00% 
Minimum Tier 1 Capital | 6.00% 
Minimum Tier 1 Capital plus conservation buffer | 8.50% 
Minimum Total Capital | 8.00% 
Minimum Total Capital plus conservation buffer | 10.50% 

Changes in Risk-Weightings
The Basel III Capital Rules significantly change the risk-weightings used to determine risk-weighted capital adequacy. Among various other changes, the Basel III Capital Rules apply a 250% risk-weighting to MSRs, DTAs that cannot be realized through net operating loss carry-backs and significant (greater than 10%) investments in other financial institutions. The proposal also would change the risk-weighting for residential mortgages, including mortgages sold. A new 150% risk-weighted category applies to “high volatility CRE loans,” or “HVCRE,” which are credit facilities for the acquisition, construction or development of real property other than one-to-four family residential properties or commercial real projects where: (i) the loan-to-value ratio is not in excess of interagency real estate lending standards; and (ii) the borrower has contributed capital equal to not less than 15% of the real estate’s “as completed” value before the loan was made.
20


The Basel III Capital Rules also change some of the risk-weightings used to determine risk-weighted capital adequacy. Among other things, the Basel III Capital Rules:

• | Assign a 250% risk-weight to MSRs;


• | Assign up to a 1,250% risk-weight to structured securities, including private label mortgage securities and asset backed securities;


• | Retain existing risk-weights for residential mortgages, but assign a 100% risk-weight to most CRE loans and a 150% risk-weight for “high volatility” CRE loans, which we refer to as HVCRE;


• | Assign a 150% risk-weight to past due exposures (other than sovereign exposures and residential mortgages);


• | Assign a 250% risk-weight to DTAs, to the extent not deducted from capital (subject to certain maximums);


• | Retain the existing 100% risk-weight for corporate and retail loans; and


• | Increase the risk-weight for exposures to qualifying securities firms from 20% to 100%.

HVCRE loans currently have a risk weight of 150%. Section 214 of the 2018 Growth Act, restricts the federal bank regulators from applying this risk weight except to certain acquisition development and construction (“ADC”) loans. The federal bank regulators issued a notice of a proposed rule on September 18, 2018 to implement Section 214 of the 2018 Growth Act, by revising the HVCRE definition. If this proposal is adopted, it is expected that this proposal would reduce the Company’s risk weighted assets and thereby increase the Company’s risk-weighted capital. For example, if the proposed rule had been in effect at December 31, 2018, the Company’s risk weighted assets would have been $60.3 million less, and the Company’s Tier 1 capital ratio would have been approximately 11 basis points greater.

Section 201 of the 2018 Growth Act provides that banks and bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion that meet a “community bank leverage ratio,” established by the federal bank regulators between 8% and 10%, are deemed to satisfy applicable risk-based capital requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized.” The federal banking agencies have the discretion to determine that an institution does not qualify for such treatment due to its risk profile. An institution’s risk profile may be assessed by its off-balance sheet exposure, trading of assets and liabilities, notional derivatives’ exposure, and other factors.
On November 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued for public comment a proposal under which a community banking organization would be eligible to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework if it has less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%. A qualifying community banking organization that has chosen the proposed framework would not be required to calculate the existing risk-based and leverage capital requirements. This proposal further provides that an institution will be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be “well-capitalized” for the agencies' prompt corrective action rules, provided it has a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-13 “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses” which applies a current expected credit losses (“CECL”) model to financial instruments. It is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2019 for public companies, though there is a phase-in for emerging growth companies. CECL may affect the amount, timing and variability of the Company’s credit charges, and therefore its net income and regulatory capital. The Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators have adopted a policy to allow a three-year phase-in of CECL’s effects on regulatory capital (the “CECL Capital Phase-In”). See “Risk Factors—Our allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or we may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures.”
FDICIA
FDICIA directs each federal bank regulatory agency to prescribe standards for depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth composition, a maximum ratio of classified assets to capital, minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses, a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded shares, safety and soundness, and such other standards as the federal bank regulators deem appropriate.
Enforcement Policies and Actions
The Federal Reserve and the OCC monitor compliance with laws and regulations. The CFPB monitors compliance with laws and regulations applicable to consumer financial products and services. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in these agencies imposing fines, penalties and/or restitution, cease and desist orders, or taking other formal or informal enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce similar remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and others participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company, including fines, penalties and the recovery, or claw-back, of compensation.

Fiscal and Monetary Policy
Banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials. In general, the difference between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and its other borrowings, and the interest received by a bank on its loans and securities holdings, constitutes the major portion of a bank’s earnings. Thus, our earnings and growth, and that of the Bank, as well as the values of, and earnings on, our assets and the costs of our deposits and other liabilities are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money through various means, including open market dealings in U.S. government securities, the setting of the discount rate at which banks may borrow from the Federal Reserve, and the reserve requirements on deposits.
The Federal Reserve has been paying interest on depository institutions’ required and excess reserve balances since October 6, 2008. The payment of interest on excess reserve balances was expected to give the Federal Reserve greater scope to use its lending programs to address conditions in credit markets while also maintaining the Federal Funds rate close to the target rate established by the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it may use this authority to implement a mandatory policy to reduce excess liquidity, in the event of, or threat of, inflation.
In April 2010, the Federal Reserve Board amended Regulation D (Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions) authorizing the Reserve Banks to offer term deposits to certain institutions. Term deposits, which are deposits with specified maturity dates, will be offered through a Term Deposit Facility. Term deposits will be one of several tools that the Federal Reserve could employ to drain reserves as policymakers judge that a less accommodative monetary policy is appropriate.
In 2011, the Federal Reserve repealed its historical Regulation Q to permit banks to pay interest on demand deposits. The Federal Reserve also engaged in several rounds of quantitative easing, or QE, to reduce interest rates by buying bonds, and “Operation Twist” to reduce long term interest rates by buying long term bonds, while selling intermediate term securities. Beginning in December 2013, the Federal Reserve began to taper the level of bonds purchased in December 2013, but continued to reinvest the principal of its securities as these mature.
The Federal Reserve’s Normalization Policy was adopted September 2014. This Policy includes gradually raising the Federal Reserve’s target range for the Federal Funds rate to more normal levels and gradually reducing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of U.S. government and agency securities. The Federal Reserve’s target Federal Funds rate has increased nine times since December 2015 in 25 basis point increments from 0.25% to 2.50% on December 20, 2018. Although the Federal Reserve considers the target Federal Funds rate its primary means of monetary policy normalization, in September 2017, it began reducing its securities holding by not reinvesting the principal of maturing securities, subject to certain monthly caps on amounts not reinvested. In 2019, due to various factors, the Federal Reserve indicated no immediate further increases in its target Federal Funds rate, and that the Federal Reserve was reconsidering an appropriate level for its securities holdings, and therefore its securities sales. In March 2019, the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee determined to slow the reduction in its monthly sales of its holdings of Treasury securities from $30 billion to $15 billion beginning in May 2019, and to conclude the reduction in its securities holdings at the end of September 2019. It will allow its holdings of mortgage backed securities, or MBS, to decline by reinvesting $20 billion per month of MBS principal repayments in Treasury securities, while retaining flexibility to sell MBS over the longer run.
The nature and timing of any changes in monetary policies and their effect on us and the Bank cannot be predicted. The turnover of a majority of the Federal Reserve Board and the members of its FOMC and the appointment of a new Federal Reserve Chairman may result in changes in policy and the timing and amount of monetary policy normalization.

FDIC Insurance Assessments
The Bank’s deposits are insured by DIF and the Bank is subject to FDIC assessments for its deposit insurance, as well as assessments by the FDIC to pay interest on Financing Corporation, or FICO, bonds.
Effective April 1, 2011, the FDIC began calculating assessments based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity, or FDIC Assessment Base, in accordance with changes mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC’s changes shifted part of the burden of deposit insurance premiums toward depository institutions relying on funding sources other than customer deposits.
Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC again changed its deposit insurance pricing and eliminated all risk categories and now uses a “financial ratios method” based on CAMELS composite ratings to determine assessment rates for small established institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, or Small Banks. The financial ratios method sets a maximum assessment for CAMELS 1 and 2 rated banks, and sets minimum assessments for lower rated institutions. All basis points are annual amounts.
The following table shows the FDIC assessment schedule for 2017 applicable to Small Banks, such as the Bank.
 | Established Small Institution CAMELS Composite
 | 1 or 2 | 3 | 4 or 5 
Initial Base Assessment Rule | 3 to 16 basis points | 6 to 30 basis points | 16 to 30 basis points
Unsecured Debt Adjustment | -5 to 0 basis points | -5 to 0 basis points | -5 to 0 basis points 
Total Base Assessment Rate | 1.5 to 16 basis points | 3 to 30 basis points | 11 to 30 basis points

 On March 15, 2016 the FDIC implemented Dodd-Frank Act provisions by raising the DIF’s minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. The FDIC imposed a 4.5 basis point annual surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, or Large Banks. The new rules grant credits to smaller banks for the portion of their regular assessments that contribute to increasing the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%.
The FDIC’s reserve ratio reached 1.36% on September 30, 2018, exceeding the minimum requirement. As a result, deposit insurance surcharges on Large Banks ceased, and smaller banks will receive credits against their deposit assessments from the FDIC for their portion of assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. The Bank’s credit at the close of 2018 was $2.1 million and credits will be received and applied against the Bank’s deposit insurance assessment each quarter that the reserve ratio exceeds 1.36%.
Prior to June 30, 2016, when the new assessment system became effective, the Bank’s overall rate for assessment calculations was 9 basis points or less, which was within the range of assessment rates for the lowest “risk category” under the former FDIC assessment rules. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded a FDIC insurance premium expense of $6.2 million, $5.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively.
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on FICO bonds, which mature during 2017 through 2019. FICO assessments are set by the FDIC quarterly on each institution’s FDIC Assessment Base. The FICO assessment was 0.580 basis points in three quarters of 2015, except for the third quarter of 2015, when the FICO assessment was 0.600 basis points. The FICO assessment rate was 0.580 basis points in the first quarter of 2016, and 0.560 basis points for the remainder of that year. The FICO Assessment rate was 0.560 basis points in the first quarter of 2017, and 0.540 basis points for the other three quarters. FICO assessments of less than $500,000 were paid to the FDIC in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. FICO assessments were 0.460 basis points in the first quarter of 2018, 0.440 basis points in the second quarter of 2018 and 0.320 basis points for the third and fourth quarters of 2018. FICO assessments of less than $500,000 were paid to the FDIC in 2018. The FICO assessments have declined to 0.140 basis points in the first quarter of 2019 and 0.120 basis points in the second quarter. The last FICO bonds mature in 2019 and the FICO assessments will end.

Lending Practices
The federal bank regulators released guidance in 2006 on “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending” (the “CRE Guidance”). The guidance defines CRE loans as exposures secured by raw land, land development and construction (including 1-4 family residential construction), multi-family property, and non-farm nonresidential property where the primary or a significant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property (that is, loans for which 50% or more of the source of repayment comes from third party, non-affiliated, rental income) or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of this property. Loans to REITs and unsecured loans to developers that closely correlate to the inherent risks in CRE markets would also be considered CRE loans under the guidance. Loans on owner occupied CRE are generally excluded.
The CRE Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. This could include enhanced strategic planning, CRE underwriting policies, risk management, internal controls, portfolio stress testing and risk exposure limits as well as appropriately designed compensation and incentive programs. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The guidance is triggered when either:

• | Total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100% or more of a bank’s total risk-based capital; or


• | Total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land are 300% or more of a bank’s total risk-based capital.

The Bank monitors its concentration of CRE loans and its relationship to its Total Risk-based Capital. The following table depicts the exposure for the last three years ending December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:
(in thousands, except percentages) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Commercial real estate (CRE) | 
Nonowner occupied | $ | 1,809,356 | | | $ | 1,713,104 | | | $ | 1,377,753
Multi-family residential | 909,439 | | | 839,709 | | | 667,256 | 
Land development and construction loans | 326,644 | | | 406,940 | | | 429,085 | 
Total CRE | $ | 3,045,439 | | | $ | 2,959,753 | | | $ | 2,474,094
% of risk-based capital | 344.61 | % | | 334.11 | % | | 291.75 | %
% of total loans | 51.44 | % | | 48.79 | % | | 42.92 | %
Land development and construction loans | $ | 326,644 | | | $ | 406,940 | | | $ | 429,085 
% of risk-based capital | 36.96 | % | | 45.94 | % | | 50.60 | %
% of total loans | 5.52 | % | | 6.71 | % | | 7.44 | %
Total risk-based capital | $ | 883,746 | | | $ | 885,855 | | | $ | 848,029 
Total loans | $ | 5,920,175 | | | $ | 6,066,225 | | | $ | 5,764,761

We have always had significant exposures to loans secured by CRE due to the nature of our markets. We believe our long term experience in CRE lending, underwriting policies, internal controls, and other policies currently in place, as well as our loan and credit monitoring and administration procedures, are generally appropriate to manage our concentrations as required under the guidance.
The federal bank regulators continue to look at the risks of various assets and asset categories and risk management. In December 2015, the federal bank regulators issued the Interagency Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending to highlight prudent risk management practices, within existing guidance, that regulated financial institutions should implement along with maintaining capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk, especially where a bank has a sharp increase in CRE loans or significant concentrations of CRE secured by a particular property type.
25


In 2013, the Federal Reserve and other banking regulators issued their “Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending” highlighting standards for originating leveraged transactions and managing leveraged portfolios, as well as requiring banks to identify their highly leveraged transactions, or HLTs. The Bank adjusted its lending practices to conform to this guidance. Beginning September 30, 2017 the Company updated application of the definition of HLT to include unfunded commitments as part of the leverage ratio calculation. As of December 31, 2018, syndicated loans that financed HLTs of $207.7 million, or 3.51% of total loans, compared to $141.3 million, or 2.33% of total loans, as of December 31, 2017 and $174.7 million, or 3.03% of total loans, as of December 31, 2016. The Government Accountability Office issued a statement on October 23, 2017 that this guidance constituted a “rule” for purposes of the Congressional Review Act, which provides Congress with the right to review the guidance and issue a joint resolution for signature by the President disapproving it. No such action was taken, and instead, the federal bank regulators issued a September 11, 2018 “Statement Reaffirming the Role of Supervisory Guidance.” This Statement indicated that guidance does not have the force or effect of law or provide the basis for enforcement actions, and that guidance can outline supervisory agencies’ views of supervisory expectations and priorities, and appropriate practices.
Other Dodd-Frank Act Provisions
In addition to the capital, liquidity and FDIC deposit insurance changes discussed above, some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that we believe may affect us are set forth below.
Financial Stability Oversight Council
The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, which is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and composed of representatives from various financial services regulators. The FSOC has responsibility for identifying risks and responding to emerging threats to financial stability.
Executive Compensation
The Dodd-Frank Act provides shareholders of all public companies with a say on executive pay. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, each company must give its shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation of its executives, on a non-binding advisory basis, at least once every three years. The Dodd-Frank Act also adds disclosure and voting requirements for golden parachute compensation that is payable to named executive officers in connection with sale transactions.
The SEC is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to issue rules obligating companies to disclose in proxy materials for annual shareholders meetings, information that shows the relationship between executive compensation actually paid to their named executive officers and their financial performance, taking into account any change in the value of the shares of a company’s stock and dividends or distributions. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides that a company’s compensation committee may only select a consultant, legal counsel or other advisor on matters of compensation after taking into consideration factors to be identified by the SEC that affect the independence of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor.
26


Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 10D to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Section 10D directs the SEC to adopt rules prohibiting a national securities exchange or association from listing a company unless it develops, implements, and discloses a policy regarding the recovery or “claw-back” of executive compensation in certain circumstances. The policy must require that, in the event an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with a financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws, we will recover from any current or former executive officer any incentive-based compensation (including stock options) received during the three year period preceding the date of the restatement, which is in excess of what would have been paid based on the restated financial statements. There is no requirement of wrongdoing by the executive, and the claw-back is mandatory and applies to all executive officers. Section 954 augments section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to return any bonus or other incentive or equity-based compensation received during the 12 months following the date of similarly inaccurate financial statements, as well as any profit received from the sale of employer securities during the period, if the restatement was due to misconduct. Unlike section 304, under which only the SEC may seek recoupment, the Dodd-Frank Act requires us to seek the return of compensation.
The SEC adopted rules in September 2013 to implement pay ratios pursuant to Section 953 of the Dodd-Frank Act, beginning with fiscal year 2017 annual reports and proxy statements. The SEC proposed Rule 10D-1 under Section 954 on July 1, 2015 which would direct the Nasdaq Stock Market and the other national securities exchanges to adopt listing standards requiring companies to adopt policies requiring executive officers to pay back erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation. In February 2017, the acting SEC Chairman indicated interest in reconsidering the pay ratio rule.
The Dodd-Frank Act, Section 955, requires the SEC, by rule, to require that each company disclose in the proxy materials for its annual meetings whether an employee or board member is permitted to purchase financial instruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of equity securities granted as compensation or otherwise held by the employee or board member. The SEC proposed implementing rules in February 2015, though the rules have not been implemented to date.
Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions, are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses. On June 21, 2010, the federal bank regulators adopted guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies, which, although targeted to larger, more complex organizations than us, include principles that have been applied to smaller organizations similar to us. This guidance applies to incentive compensation to executives as well as employees, who, “individually or a part of a group, have the ability to expose a banking organization to material amounts of risk.” Incentive compensation should:

• | provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward;


• | be compatible with effective controls and risk-management; and


• | be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.

The federal bank regulators, the SEC and other regulators proposed regulations implementing Section 956 in April 2011, which would have been applicable to, among others, depository institutions and their holding companies with $1 billion or more in assets. An advance notice of a revised proposed joint rulemaking under Section 956 was published by the financial services regulators in May 2016, but these rules have not been adopted. New discussions about implementing rules have arisen in early 2019.
27


As an emerging growth company, we are eligible to take advantage of exemptions to some of the requirements detailed above that are imposed upon us as a public company, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirement to provide information on the relationship between executive compensation actually paid to our named executive officers and our financial performance, exemptions from the requirement to disclose the ratio of our Chief Executive Officer pay to the pay of our median employee, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
Debit Card Interchange Fees
The “Durbin Amendment” to the Dodd-Frank Act provide for new rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electric debit transactions be “reasonable” and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions. The Federal Reserve has established standards for assessing whether interchange fees are reasonable and proportional, which a Federal District Court ruled were improperly adopted. This decision in NACS v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, was reversed by the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in 2014 and the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal on January 20, 2015. The Durbin Amendment is applicable to banking organizations with assets of $10 billion.
As a subsidiary of MSF, we were subject to the Durbin Amendment interchange rules since MSF had consolidated assets over $10 billion. As a result of not being controlled by MSF after 2018, we are not subject to the Federal Reserve’s Durbin Amendment limits on interchange.
Derivatives
The Dodd-Frank Act requires a new regulatory system for the U.S. market for swaps and other over-the counter derivatives, which includes strict capital and margin requirements, central clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, and heightened supervision of over-the-counter derivatives dealers and major market participants. These rules likely have increased the costs and collateral required to utilize derivatives, that we may determine are useful to reduce our interest rate and other risks.
Other
The Dodd-Frank Act required an estimated 240-300 rulemakings and an estimated 130 studies. Many of these rules and studies have been completed. Generally, the Dodd-Frank Act and the related rules are complex, have increased our compliance costs, as well as costs imposed on the markets and on others with whom we do business. Many of the rules still lack authoritative interpretative guidance from the applicable government agencies.
Other Legislative and Regulatory Changes
Various legislative and regulatory proposals, including substantial changes in banking, and the regulation of banks, and other depositories and financial institutions, compensation, and the regulation of financial markets and their participants and financial instruments, and the regulators of all of these, as well as the taxation of these entities, are being considered by the executive branch of the federal government, Congress and various state governments.
28


The President of the U.S. and certain members of the Legislature appear committed to financial regulatory reform, including changes to the Dodd-Frank Act. The President has frozen new rulemaking generally, and on February 3, 2017 issued an executive order containing “Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System,” or the Core Principles. The executive order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to consult with heads of Financial Stability Oversight Council’s members and report to the President within 120 days and periodically thereafter on how laws and government policies promote the Core Principles and to identify laws, regulations, guidance and reporting that restrain financial services regulation in a manner consistent with the Core Principles. Another executive order requires the repeal of two existing rules for any new significant regulatory proposal. Although this executive order does not apply to the SEC, the federal bank regulators or the CFPB, these independent agencies are encouraged to seek cost savings that would offset the costs of new significant regulatory actions.
The 2018 Growth Act, which was enacted on May 24, 2018, amends the Dodd-Frank Act, the BHC Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and other federal banking and securities laws to provide regulatory relief in these areas:

• | consumer credit and mortgage lending;


• | capital requirements;


• | Volcker Rule compliance;


• | stress testing and enhanced prudential standards; and


• | capital formation.

On July 6, 2018, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued an interagency statement describing their interim positions on regulations affected by the 2018 Growth Act that remain in effect until the agencies amend their regulations to conform to that Act.
We are evaluating the 2018 Growth Act and its likely effects on us. We believe it will facilitate our business, subject to its interpretation and implementation by our regulators. The following provisions of the 2018 Growth Act may be especially helpful to banks of our size:

• | “qualifying community banks,” defined as institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, which meet a “community bank leverage ratio” of 8.00% to 10.00%, may be deemed to have satisfied applicable risk based capital requirements as well as the capital ratio requirements;


• | section 13(h) of the BHC Act, or the “Volcker Rule,” is amended to exempt from the Volcker Rule, banks with total consolidated assets valued at less than $10 billion, and trading assets and liabilities comprising not more than 5.00% of total assets;


• | “reciprocal deposits” will not be considered “brokered deposits” for FDIC purposes, provided such deposits do not exceed the lesser of $5 billion or 20% of the bank’s total liabilities; and


• | the consolidated asset threshold at which company-run stress tests are required increased from $10 billion to $250 billion, and the consolidated asset threshold for mandatory risk committees increased from $10 billion to $50 billion.

29


On November 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued for public comment a proposal that would simplify regulatory capital requirements for qualifying community banking organizations, as required by the 2018 Growth Act. Under the proposal, a qualifying community banking organization would be eligible to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework. See “Supervision and Regulation—Other Legislative and Regulatory Changes.”
The Volcker Rule change may enable us to invest in certain collateralized loan obligations that are treated as “covered funds” prohibited to banking entities by the Volcker Rule. Reciprocal deposits, such as CDARs, may expand our funding sources without being subjected to FDIC limitations and potential insurance assessments increases for brokered deposits. The FDIC announced on December 19, 2018 a final rule that change existing rules to comply with the 2018 Growth Act’s reciprocal deposits provisions effective March 26, 2019. Well-capitalized and well-rated banks are not required to treat reciprocal deposits as brokered deposits up to the lesser of 20% of total liabilities or $5 billion. Banks that are not both well-capitalized and well-rated may exclude reciprocal deposits under certain circumstances. The December 19, 2018 release also included a proposal seeking comments on the brokered deposits and related interest rates restrictions rules. Reciprocal deposits, such as CDARs, may expand our funding sources without being subjected to FDIC limitations and potential insurance assessments increases for brokered deposits.

Certain of these proposals, if adopted, could significantly change the regulation or operations of banks and the financial services industry. New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of the nation’s financial institutions.
