Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
MJ Holdings Inc. (OTC Pink: MJNE) is a highly-diversified, publicly-traded, cannabis holding company providing cultivation management, licensing support, production management, asset and infrastructure development – concentrated in the Las Vegas market. It is our intention to grow our business and provide a 360-degree spectrum of infrastructure (including: cultivation, production management, dispensaries and consulting services) through: the acquisition of existing companies; joint ventures with existing companies possessing complementary expertise, and/or through the development of new opportunities. We intend to “prove the concept” profitably in the rapidly expanding Las Vegas market and then use that anticipated success as a template for replicating the concept in other developing states through a combination of strategic partnerships, acquisitions and opening new operations.
 
The Company’s assets and operations have expanded significantly over the past year; and, the Company recently received more than $6,000,000, from the sale of common stock previously returned to the Company, to facilitate further expansion of its cultivation footprint as well as to launch seed generation and production facilities and the rollout of its Highland Brothers brand of cannabis products for consumption in the United States, Canada and European markets.
 
Under the leadership of our CEO, Paris Balaouras, the Company has assembled a senior management team possessing significant experience in building, acquiring and operating high-growth, multi-division businesses in a public company setting. The Company also has retained operating level employees, directly and through strategic relationships, possessing significant experience in marijuana cultivation and production.
 
Current Initiatives include:
 

● | a three-acre, hybrid, outdoor, marijuana-cultivation facility (the “Three Acre Facility”) in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada. We have the contractual right to cultivate marijuana on this property until 2026, for which we receive eighty-five percent (85%) of the net revenues produced from our management of this facility. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 260 acres of farmland for the purpose of cultivating additional marijuana (the “260 Acres”) purchased in January of 2019. This property, on which we intend to utilize a state-of-the-art cultivation system for growing, initially, an additional five acres of marijuana in 2020, is contiguous to the property that we manage in Amargosa. This cultivation system should allow us to harvest two full crops per year. The land also has more than 180-acre feet of permitted water rights, which will provide more than sufficient water to markedly increase the Company’s marijuana cultivation capabilities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a nearby commercial trailer and RV park (the “Trailer Park”) that can supply necessary housing for our farm employees. After our 2018 harvest, which yielded approximately 5,400 lbs. of marijuana, we came to realize that we would need to find a more efficient method of bringing our cultivation team to our facilities every day. In April of 2019, we consummated the purchase of the 50-acre plus Trailer Park for $600,000 in cash and $50,000 of the Company’s restricted common stock (see further description of this transaction hereinbelow). This property also has sufficient land and water to locate our hemp seed genetics lab; we are in the process of securing the necessary permits to commence construction of the facility. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a definitive agreement to acquire an additional cultivation license and production license, both currently located in Nye County Nevada. On April 2, 2019 we executed a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests of MJ Distributing C202, LLC and MJ Distributing P133, LLC, the holders of a State of Nevada provisional cultivation license and provisional production license, respectively (see further description of this transaction hereinbelow). We expect to consummate this transaction in the fourth quarter of 2019 after receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | indoor cultivation facility build-out in the City of Las Vegas (the “Indoor Facility”). Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Red Earth, LLC, we hold Medical Marijuana Establishment Registration Certificate, Application No. C012. In cooperation with our joint venture partners, Element NV LLC we expect to invest more than $3,500,000.00 in the build-out of this more than 17,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility, which should be fully operational in the second quarter of 2020 (see Subsequent Events for additional information). We presently have approximately eight years remaining on our lease on this building with two additional five-year options, as well as an option to purchase the property for $2,607,880. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exploration of cannabis-related opportunities in the European Union, with a particular focus on Greece - In December of 2018 we established MJ International Research Company, Ltd., headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. We have established two wholly owned subsidiaries in Greece, Gioura International Single Member Private Company for the acquisition of land and MJ Holdings International Single Member S.A. for the required licenses. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a wellness hotel concept (the “Alternative Hospitality”). In November of 2018 the Company formed Alternative Hospitality, Inc., a joint venture with a successful hotel operator, is developing hotel properties with a focus on the wellness aspects of cannabis and cannabis related products. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also continue to identify potential acquisition of revenue producing assets and licenses within legalized cannabis markets both nationally and internationally that can maximize shareholder value while providing a 360-degree spectrum of infrastructure, cultivation, production, management, dispensaries and consulting services in the regulated cannabis industry
 
We may face substantial competition in the operation of cultivation facilities in Nevada. Numerous other companies have also been granted cultivation licenses, and, therefore, we anticipate that we will face competition from these other companies. Our management team has experience in successfully developing, implementing, and operating marijuana cultivation and related businesses in other legal cannabis markets. We believe our experience in cultivation and facility management will provide us with a competitive advantage over our competitors. Senior management now also includes a number of executives possessing significant experience with public companies, in mergers and acquisitions, and with raising public and private equity and debt financing.
 
The Company occupies the entire second floor of an approximately 10,000 sq. ft. office building, located in the City of Las Vegas. This properly was acquired in October of 2018.
 
Corporate History/Acquisition of Red Earth
 
We were incorporated on November 17, 2006, as Securitas EDGAR Filings, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada. Prior to the formation of Securitas EDGAR Filings Inc., the business was operated as Xpedient EDGAR Filings, LLC, a Florida Limited Liability Company, formed on October 31, 2005. On November 21, 2005, Xpedient EDGAR Filings LLC amended its Articles of Organization to change its name to Securitas EDGAR Filings, LLC. On January, 21 2009, Securitas EDGAR Filings LLC merged into Securitas EDGAR Filings, Inc., a Nevada corporation. On February 14, 2014, we amended and restated our Articles of Incorporation and changed our name to MJ Holdings, Inc.
 
On November 22, 2016, in connection with a plan to divest ourselves of our real estate business, we submitted to our stockholders an offer to exchange (the “Exchange Offer”) our common stock for shares in MJ Real Estate Partners, LLC, (“MJRE”) a newly-formed LLC formed for the sole purpose of effecting the Exchange Offer. On January 10, 2017, the Company accepted for exchange 1,800,000 shares of our Common Stock in exchange for 1,800,000 shares of MJRE’s common units, representing membership interests in MJRE. Effective February 1, 2017, we transferred our ownership interests in the real estate properties and our subsidiaries, through which we hold ownership of the real estate properties, to MJRE. MJRE also assumed the senior notes and any and all obligations associated with the real estate properties and business, effective February 1, 2017.
 
On December 15, 2017, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Red Earth, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Red Earth”) established in October 2016, in exchange for 52,732,969 shares of our Common Stock and a promissory note in the amount of $900,000. The acquisition was accounted for as a “Reverse Merger”, whereby Red Earth was considered the accounting acquirer and became our wholly owned subsidiary. Upon the consummation of the acquisition, the now-former members of Red Earth became the beneficial owners of approximately 88% of our Common Stock, obtained controlling interest of the Company, and retained certain of our key management positions. In accordance with the accounting treatment for a “reverse merger” or a “reverse acquisition”, our historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger will be replaced with the historical financial statements of Red Earth prior to the reverse merger in all future filings with the SEC.

The consolidated financial statements after completion of the reverse merger included: the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the combined company from and after the closing date of the reverse merger, with only certain aspects of pre-consummation stockholders’ equity remaining in the consolidated financial statements. In February of 2019, the Company repurchased, from the Company’s largest shareholder, 20,000,000 of the 26,366,484 shares that this shareholder originally received in connection with the Reverse Merger - for a total purchase price of $20,000.
 
From February 2014 to January 2017, we owned and leased to licensed marijuana operator’s real estate properties zoned for legalized marijuana operations.
 
Our Business History
 
In April 2018, the Company entered into a management agreement with a Nevada company (the “Licensed Operator”) that holds a license for the legal cultivation of marijuana for sale under the laws of the State of Nevada. In January of 2019, the Company entered into a revised agreement with the Licensed Operator in order to be more stringently aligned with Nevada marijuana laws. The material terms of the agreement remain unchanged. The Licensed Operator is contractually obligated to pay over to the Company eighty-five (85%) percent of gross revenues defined as gross proceeds from sales of marijuana products minus applicable state excise taxes and local sales tax. The agreement is to remain in force until April, 2026. In April 2019, the Licensed Operator was acquired by a publicly traded Canadian cannabis company; the acquisition was subject to all of the contractual obligations between the Company and the Licensed Operator.
 
Pursuant to those agreements, the Licensed Operator engaged us to develop, manage and operate a licensed cultivation facility on property owned by the Licensed Operator. Between April and August of 2018, at our sole cost and expense, we completed the construction of a 120,000 square-foot outdoor grow facility, including the construction of an 8,000 square-foot building and installation of required security fencing, meeting all of the State of Nevada’s stringent building codes and regulations. Operation of this facility commenced in August, 2018 with our first test grow. We commenced harvest operations in November of 2018 and completed the harvest on December 24, 2018 - yielding more than 5,000 total pounds of marijuana trim and flower.
 
In April 2018, the State of Nevada finalized and approved the transfer of provisional Medical Marijuana Establishment Registration Certificate No. 012 (the “Certificate”) from Acres Medical, LLC to our wholly owned subsidiary, Red Earth, LLC (“Red Earth”). HDGLV, LLC (“HDGLV”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Red Earth, holds a triple-net leasehold interest in a 17,298 square-foot commercial building located on Western Avenue in the City of Las Vegas, which will be home to our indoor cultivation facility (the “Western Facility”). The initial term of the lease is for a period of ten years with two additional five-year lease options. HDGLV also possesses an option to purchase the building for $2,607,880 which is exercisable between months 25 and 60 of the initial term of the lease. In August of 2018 we received final approval from the State of Nevada, Department of Taxation to commence cultivation activities with respect to the Certificate. Contemporaneously therewith, Red Earth was issued a Business License by the City of Las Vegas to operate a marijuana cultivation facility at the Western Facility; however, the City of Las Vegas Department of Building & Safety requested that additional modifications be made to the premises prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy (“COI”). The COI is expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2020, which will then allow the Company to commence legal marijuana cultivation activities within the City of Las Vegas.
 
In July of 2018 the Company entered into a Corporate Advisory Agreement (“Advisory Agreement”) with a New York City based consulting company (the “Consultant”) to provide business management, corporate compliance and related services to the Company and its subsidiaries. The Advisory Agreement granted to the Consultant an option to acquire up to 10,000 additional shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $1.20. The options have a term of three years. The fair value of these stock options was determined to be $6,738 using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model based on the following assumptions: (i) volatility rate of 222%, (ii) discount rate of 2.88%, (iii) zero expected dividend yield, and (iv) expected life of three years. In September 2018, the Company terminated the Advisory Agreement pursuant to its terms and paid to the Consultant compensation consisting of 25,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and a $6,000 cash payment.
 
On August 13, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to designate a series of its convertible preferred stock, consisting of 2,500 shares. The stated value of each share of Preferred Stock is $1,000. Subject to a standard “4.99% Beneficial Ownership Limitation blocker,” each share of Preferred Stock was convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at any time or from time to time at a conversion price equivalent of $0.75 per share, subject to adjustment as described in Certificate of Designation.
 
On August 13, 2018 (the “Transaction Closing Date”), the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company sold and issued 2,500 shares of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) to a single institutional, accredited investor for $1,000 per share or an aggregate subscription of $2,500,000. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Preferred Stock was converted into 3,333,333 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.75 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the Certificate of Designation. The Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the purchaser, which required the Company to register for resale the underlying common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration statement on Form S-1/A was declared effective on October 24, 2018.

On August 13, 2018 (the “Effective Transaction Date”), the Company closed the transactions contemplated by an Exclusive Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”). The Agreement is between the Company and Healthier Choices Management Corp., a designer and seller (the “Seller” or “HCMC”) of a series of integrated products, all of which are designed to be utilized to consume cannabis products by vaporizing oil and other related products (the “Goods”). The Company has the exclusive right to distribute the Goods in the territory of Nevada (the “Territory”). The Distribution Agreement further requires the Company to advertise and market the Goods in the Territory. Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the Company purchased certain of the Goods from the Seller and paid the sum of two million dollars ($2,000,000). The funds were transferred to HCMC on the Effective Transaction Date. The Seller has applied for and received patent protection in respect of one of the products. The Distribution Agreement is subject to standard termination provisions; however, the Seller has the option to terminate the Distribution Agreement, on 30 days’ written notice, if the Company fails to purchase a sufficient minimum quantity of Goods from the Seller. The Company has met its obligations for the first year of the Agreement. Thereafter, for each renewal term, the Company’s minimum purchase obligation for the Goods is $500,000, subject to good faith negotiation at the end of each contract year. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Seller granted to the Company a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, and non-sub licensable fully paid license agreement. This Agreement was terminated, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, effective August 12, 2019.
 
On August 13, 2018, the Company entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement with HCMC to acquire 1,500,000,000 shares of their common stock in exchange for 85,714 shares of the Company’s common stock. The value of the stock exchanged by each party on the date of exchange was $150,000. This represents a less than 5% ownership interest for each company in the others’ company, and the shares issued are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”). Please see note 11, Inventory, for further discussion of the Company’s additional business interests with HCMC.
 
The Company recorded the 85,714 shares of HCMC common stock as an available for sale security and intends to mark the value to market each reporting period based on the current market value of its held shares in HCMC. As of the transaction date, the price as quoted on the OTC Markets for HCMC common stock was $0.0001 per share.
 
In August of 2018, the Company executed a letter of intent (“LOI”) for the acquisition of all of the membership units of Farm Road, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company (“Farm Road”). Farm Road was the owner of five parcels of farmland in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada totaling 260 acres and the concomitant 180 acre-feet of water rights. Pursuant to the terms of a membership interest purchase agreement (“MIPA”) executed between the Company and Farm Road in November of 2018, the Company was to acquire Farm Road for $1,000,000 on the following terms: a deposit of $50,000 in cash and $50,000 of the Company’s restricted common stock upon execution of the LOI, to be held in escrow until closing, $150,000 in cash payable at closing and a promissory note bearing 5% simple annual interest (the “Promissory Note”) in the amount of $750,000.00 payable to FR Holdings, LLC (an unrelated third party) (“FRH”) in 36 equal monthly interest only payments of three thousand one hundred twenty five ($3,125.00) dollars commencing on the March 1, 2019. On January 18, 2019, pursuant to the terms the MIPA, the Company acquired a 100% interest in Farm Road. The terms of the Promissory Note include a balloon payment to be made on January 17, 2022 of any then remaining principal balance and accrued interest. The MIPA further provides that FRH shall be entitled to receive a consulting fee of five per cent (5%) of the gross sales from any commercial use of the property up to a maximum of five hundred thousand ($500,000.00) dollars payable to FRH within two years of the January 18, 2019 closing date. This will be the home of our Nye County cultivation facility upon closing of our purchase of the required licenses. The Company has started construction of a state-of-the-art five-acre cultivation facility on this property which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2020.
 
In September of 2018 the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Red Earth, applied for five Recreational Marijuana Establishment Licenses to operate up to five retail marijuana stores within the state of Nevada. The Company’s goal was to open a store within the City of Las Vegas, as well as additional dispensaries in Washoe County near Lake Tahoe, in North Las Vegas, unincorporated Clark County and Henderson, Nevada. The Company received notice in early December 2018 that none of the submitted applications received sufficiently high enough scores after being graded by the Nevada Department of Taxation (“NVDOT”). In connection with the license applications we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with a third party (the “Party”). Pursuant to the terms of the MOU the Party made payments to us totaling $232,500, which was paid during the year ended December 31, 2018. The Party was entitled to receive shares of our restricted common stock with a fair market value as of the trading day immediately preceding the date the first license application was submitted to NVDOT (September 20, 2018) equal to $232,500. The Company issued 91,177 shares of common stock to the Party in connection with this transaction. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the Company has entered into an agreement with the Party to relieve the Company and the Party of any further obligations under the MOU in exchange for an additional 373,823 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock.
 
The Company has joined with more than 15 other plaintiffs in an action against the State of Nevada in regard to how the applications were scored and as to why licenses were granted to other applicants in contravention of the guidelines published by the State of Nevada. On August 23, 2019 a Nevada District Court judge issued a preliminary injunction enjoining any of the entities that were granted licenses from opening new dispensaries based upon the failure of NVDOT (the administrative body tasked with adopting and enforcing marijuana regulations within the State of Nevada) to enforce a provision of Ballot Question 2 (“BQ2”), that was approved by Nevada voters in 2016 and adopted by the Nevada legislature and codified as NRS 453D, which legalized the sale and distribution of recreational use marijuana. The law requires that “each prospective owner, officer and board member of a marijuana establishment license applicant” undergo a background check. The judge found that many of the successful license applicants failed to comply with this requirement. On August 29, 2019 the judge modified the ruling and is allowing thirteen of the successful license applicants who the State of Nevada have certified as having complied with the requirements of BQ2 to open new dispensaries as granted in December of 2018. The plaintiffs shall now continue to trial on the merits of the pending litigation against the State of Nevada.

We completed the harvest of approximately 5,400 lbs. of marijuana flower and trim in late December of 2018. We began realizing revenues from this harvest in the first quarter of 2019.
 
In January of 2019, the Company completed the purchase of 260-acres of fertile farmland in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada. The land has more than 180-acre feet of permitted water rights which will provide more than sufficient water to markedly increase the Company’s marijuana cultivation capabilities (see further description hereinabove).

In January of 2019, we formed Coachill-Inn, LLC (“Coachill-Inn”), a subsidiary of Alternative Hospitality to develop a proposed hotel in Desert Hot Springs, CA. From January of this year until June of this year we were actively engaged in negotiations with the property owner of the proposed location. In June of this year Coachill-Inn executed a purchase and sale agreement with Coachill Holdings, LLC (“CHL”) to acquire a 256,132 sq. ft. parcel of land within a 100-acre industrial cannabis park in Indigo, CA (the “Property”) to develop our first hotel project.

In April of 2019, we executed a membership interest purchase agreement (the “MIPA2”) to acquire all of the membership interests in two Nevada limited liability companies that are each the holder of a State of Nevada marijuana license. Marijuana Establishment Registration Certificate, Application No. C202 and Marijuana Establishment Registration Certificate, Application No. P133 (collectively the “Certificates”). The terms of the MIPA2 require the Company to purchase the licenses for the total sum of $1,250,000 each - $750,000 in cash per license and $500,000 per license in the Company’s restricted common stock.  The terms of the MIPA provide for a $250,000 non-refundable down payment and include a short term note in the amount of $500,000 carrying an annual interest rate of two percent (2%) which is due and payable on or before October 18, 2019, the Company has made non-refundable deposits totaling $550,000 and has reduced the principal of the aforementioned note to $200,000. We have made significant progress toward perfecting these licenses and transferring the membership interests in the licenses to the Company. It is expected that we will receive all of the necessary regulatory approvals during the fourth quarter of this year. The Company is required to issue 1,430,206 shares of our restricted common stock in fulfillment of our obligations in the MIPA2, as of the date of this filing these shares have not been issued. We also executed a $750,000 long term note (the “LT Note”) in favor of the current license holders that becomes due and payable upon the earliest of a) six months after the transfer of the Certificates to the Company, or b) six months after the production/cultivation is declared fully operational by the applicable regulatory agencies, or c) March 10, 2020. The LT Note carries an 8% annual interest rate and there is no penalty for any prepayments of the LT Note. Additionally, the sellers shall receive, at closing, warrants to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional shares of the Company’s common stock; 1,000,000 warrants shall be exercisable for a period of three years from the closing date at an exercise price of $2.00 per share and 500,000 warrants shall be exercisable for a period of two years from the closing date at an exercise price of $1.50 per share (collectively the “Warrants”). The LT Note Warrants and the restricted common shares issued will be held in escrow until the transaction closes upon the terms of the MIPA2. It is the intention of the Company, upon receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, to move the cultivation license from its current location to the Company’s 260-acre facility in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada and move the production license into its recently acquired leasehold in Pahrump, Nevada.
 
In April of 2019, we consummated our purchase of an approximately 50-acre, commercial trailer and RV park (the “Trailer Park”) in close proximity to our Amargosa Valley cultivation facilities. The Trailer Park can accommodate up to 90 trailers and RV’s. There presently are 17 occupied trailers in the Trailer Park and we are making necessary upgrades to bring additional units to the facility to provide housing for our farm personnel. We purchased the Trailer Park for a total of $600,000 in cash and $50,000 of the Company’s restricted common stock, resulting in the issuance of 66,667 shares. The sellers hold a $250,000 note, bearing interest at six and one-half percent resulting in monthly payments in the amount of $2,177.77 based upon a 15-year amortization schedule (the “TP Note”). The TP Note requires additional principal reduction payments in the amount of $50,000 on or before April 5, 2020 and April 5, 2021, respectively. The principal and interest payments will be recalculated. A final balloon payment of any and all outstanding principal and accrued interest is due and payable on or before April 5, 2022. There are no prepayment penalties should the Company elect to retire the note prior to its maturity date. It is the Company’s intention to locate our hemp seed genetics lab on this property. The land possesses sufficient water rights to successfully cultivate hemp for the purpose of developing proprietary hemp strains that should thrive in the harsh Amargosa climate.
 
On August 30, 2019 the Company entered into a material definitive agreement with an Ohio limited liability company (the “Buyer”) to sell forty-nine percent (49%) of the membership interests in the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Red Earth, LLC (“Red Earth”) for $441,000. The membership interest purchase agreement (the “MIPA3”) requires the Buyer to make an additional $3,559,000 payment to be utilized for the improvement and build-out of the Company’s Western Avenue leasehold in Las Vegas, Nevada. The payment is due within ten (10) days of the receipt by Red Earth of a special use permit (“SUP”) from the City of Las Vegas for our Western Avenue cultivation facility. The Company expects to receive the SUP in early October of 2019. The Buyer, in conjunction with the Company, will jointly manage and operate the facility upon completion. The MIPA3 also requires the Buyer to make a final payment to the Company of $1,000,000 between 90 and 180 days of issuance of the SUP. Additionally, the Buyer has a first refusal right to fund and build a 40,000 sq. ft. greenhouse facility at the Company’s Amargosa Valley Farm the terms of which are to be negotiated in good faith upon the exercise of any rights granted in the MIPA3.
 
We intend to grow continue to our business through the acquisition of existing companies and/or through the development of new opportunities and joint ventures that can maximize shareholder value while providing a 360-degree spectrum of infrastructure (dispensaries), cultivation, production, management, and consulting services in the regulated cannabis industry.

Marijuana Industry Overview
 
We currently operate marijuana businesses in Nevada. Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana is permitted in Nevada, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable state laws and regulations. Any changes in federal, state, or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability, and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance, or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
 
Marijuana cultivation refers to the planting, tending, improving and harvesting of the flowering plant Cannabis, primarily for the production and consumption of cannabis flowers, often referred to as “buds”. The cultivation techniques for marijuana cultivation differ than for other purposes such as hemp production. Generally, references to marijuana cultivation and production do not include hemp production.
 
Cannabis belongs to the genus Cannabis in the family Cannabaceae and for the purposes of production and consumption, includes three species, C. sativa (“Sativa”), C. Indica (“Indica”), and C. ruderalis (“Ruderalis”). Sativa and Indica generally grow tall with some varieties reaching approximately 4 meters. The female plants produce flowers rich in tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Ruderalis is a short plant and produces trace amounts of THC but is very rich in cannabidiol (“CBD”), which is an antagonist (inhibits the physiological action) to THC.
 
As of October 2019, there are a total of 33 states, plus the District of Columbia, with legislation passed as it relates to medicinal cannabis. These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted use for medical treatment in the U.S., and lacks acceptable safety for use under medical supervision. These xx states, plus the District of Columbia, have adopted laws that exempt patients who use medicinal cannabis under a physician’s supervision from state criminal penalties. These are collectively referred to as the states that have de-criminalized medicinal cannabis, although there is a subtle difference between de-criminalization and legalization, and each state’s laws are different.
 
As of October 2019, 11 states and the District of Columbia now allow for the recreational use and possession of small amounts of marijuana and marijuana products. Decriminalization of marijuana varies by state. Decriminalization generally means that violators of local marijuana laws may be subject to civil penalty rather than face criminal prosecution. Fifteen states have decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana but have not legalized possession. In these states decriminalization can mean possession of as little as ten grams of marijuana up to one-hundred grams of marijuana that will not result in any criminal prosecution but may result in civil fines. In three states, Idaho, South Dakota, and Kansas, the cultivation, possession or use of marijuana is strictly prohibited and violators may be subject to criminal prosecution. In Nevada, where the Company is headquartered and currently focused most of its activities, legalized marijuana for recreational use was effective as of July 1, 2017 and made it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to one ounce of marijuana flowers and one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, businesses can legally, pursuant to state regulations, cultivate, process, dispense, distribute, and test marijuana products under certain conditions.
 
The dichotomy between federal and state laws has limited the access to banking and other financial services by marijuana businesses. Recently the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the U.S. Department of Treasury issued guidance for banks considering conducting business with marijuana dispensaries in states where those businesses are legal, pursuant to which banks must now file a Marijuana Limited Suspicious Activity Report that states the marijuana business is following the government’s guidelines with regard to revenue that is generated exclusively from legal sales. However, since the same guidance noted that banks could still face prosecution if they provide financial services to marijuana businesses, it has led to the widespread refusal of the banking industry to offer banking services to marijuana businesses operating within state and local laws. In March of this year, U.S. Congressman Ed Perlmutter (D – Colorado) introduced house bill H.R. 1595, known as the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act to allow legally operating cannabis related businesses to utilize traditional banking services without fear of federal agencies taking legal action against the banks or their customers. The SAFE bill has strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives and many industry observers anticipate it will be ratified within the next year.

The DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity.
 In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits.
 
Furthermore, H.R. 83, known as the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, is a rider to the annual appropriations bill that prohibits the DOJ from using federal funds to prevent certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. This prohibition is currently in place until November 21, 2019.
 
We are monitoring the Trump administration’s, the DOJ’s, and Congress’ positions on federal marijuana law and policy. Based on public statements and reports, we understand that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.
