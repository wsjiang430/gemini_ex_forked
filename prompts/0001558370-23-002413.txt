Further information about our reportable segments and sales by geographic region is included in Notes 1, 2 and 20 of the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For backlog by reportable segment, refer to Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Axon employees are distributed across multiple geographies and report to work via a remote-hybrid model, which leverages both in-person collaboration environments as well as cloud-based software tools that enable remote productivity. Our physical headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona houses some executive management, sales, marketing, certain engineering, manufacturing, finance and other administrative support functions. Our other key in-person facilities include Seattle, London and Ho Chi Minh City. We also have subsidiaries, and in some cases offices located in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
Key Product Category Revenue Drivers: What We Offer
Axon products are generally cloud-connected, designed to drive better outcomes and customer experiences, and sold via mutually reinforcing integrated bundles. Our key revenue drivers belong to three broad product categories:

● | TASER: We develop smart devices, tools and services that support public safety officers in de-escalating situations, avoiding or minimizing use of force and aiding consumer personal protection. These tools include TASER devices, virtual reality training services and consumer devices. Research has shown that TASER devices are the most effective less-than-lethal force option, with the lowest likelihood of injury to officers and assailants. Since our inception in 1993, TASER devices have been
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

adopted by a majority of U.S. state and local police departments and are used daily to help keep communities safe. Global adoption of TASER devices remains early and we are expanding into new geographies. Axon VR solutions make public safety training more accessible, relevant and affordable — with the goal of using new immersive VR technologies to better prepare officers for real-life situations in the field.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sensors: Axon devices address many needs, including transparency, real-time situational awareness, and capturing evidence accurately and integrating with software workflows. Product categories within sensors include Axon body cameras, Axon Fleet in-car systems, and other devices that work with our software.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Software: Axon is building a suite of cloud-based, software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions that integrate with our sensors and TASER devices to benefit customers and drive annual recurring revenue, which totaled $473 million(a) as of December 31, 2022. We have many SaaS solutions, which can best be trisected into three categories: digital evidence management, productivity and real-time operations solutions. Axon Evidence is the world’s largest cloud-hosted public safety data repository of public safety video data and other types of digital evidence. Our productivity suite, which includes Axon Records, is designed to save officers time spent writing reports and doing paperwork. And our real-time operations capabilities, which include Axon Respond, integrates location data, signal alerts and video feeds to provide a complete picture of evolving situations.

Sales and Distribution: Who We Sell To and Where We Deliver
We think of our core customers as falling into roughly four categories of funding sources: U.S. state and local governments, the U.S. federal government, international government customers, and commercial enterprises. Additionally, the types of customers who find value in our product offerings are expanding beyond law enforcement to include attorneys, fire and EMS personnel, corrections and the U.S. military.
Axon’s sales force and strong customer relationships represent key strategic advantages. The majority of our revenues are generated via direct sales, including our online store, although we do leverage distribution partners and third-party resellers.
Our largest customer segment is U.S. state and local law enforcement. Axon has a customer relationship with over 95% of state and local law enforcement agencies in the United States. The remaining agencies are served via our telesales team, as well as distributors.
No customer represented more than 10% of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.
We are diversifying into new markets by adding new types of customer profiles, or users, and by adding to our core customer base. In recent years, we have been investing in sales personnel to capture these new markets, and in 2023, we will focus on strategic headcount additions to support key new markets and newer products. 
Governmental agencies generally have the ability to terminate our contracts, in whole or in part, for reasons including, but not limited to, non-appropriation of funds. We continue to monitor developments in federal government funding.
Resources 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
We perform light manufacturing, final assembly, and final test operations at our headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, and own substantially all of the equipment required to develop, prototype, manufacture and assemble our finished products. We have continued to maintain both our ISO 9001 and our ISO 9001:2015 certifications.

We continue to take steps to diversify our supply chain and global manufacturing footprint, which positioned us well managing through the recent supply chain challenges. Thus far, we have been able to produce and ship our critical core products. As we enter 2023, material availability is improving but still poses real risks to all businesses that manufacture products. Supplier decommitments remain our largest area of risk as we continue to experience this in several areas. However, we have put programs in place to mitigate this risk. We proactively manage our supply chain down to third tier suppliers to overcome material shortages as they arise. These actions align to our strategic model to help meet strong product demand while also preparing us to stagger factory work schedules as needed, which enables us to meet compressed build schedules over short periods of time. We continue to adjust strategic inventory levels based on areas of risk to mitigate potential supply disruptions.
In light of our broad domestic and international geographic supplier base, we are continuously monitoring our supply chain to manage through potential impacts, identifying alternate shipping / logistic sources, and working with foreign regulators to ensure that our suppliers can provide parts.
We obtain many of our components from single source suppliers; however, because we own the injection molded component tooling used in their production, we believe we could obtain alternative suppliers in most cases without incurring significant production delays. For additional discussion of sources and availability of raw materials, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We provide limited manufacturer’s warranties on our Axon devices and CEDs, and customers also have the option to purchase extended warranties. For additional information about our warranties, refer to Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property with U.S. and international patents and trademarks. Our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations and laws to protect our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2022, we hold 274 U.S. patents, 109 U.S. registered trademarks, 165 international patents, and 415 international registered trademarks, and also have numerous patent and trademark applications pending. 
We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular countries and regions, our strategic technology or product directions in different countries, and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions. We have the exclusive rights to many Internet domain names, primarily including “Axon.com”, “Evidence.com”, and “TASER.com.” We also vigorously protect our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents and trade secrets against third-party infringement.
Confidentiality agreements are used with employees, consultants and key suppliers to help ensure the confidentiality of our trade secrets.
Competition
Sensors — Connected Cameras and Digital Evidence Management Software: The body-worn camera and in-car video/automatic license plate readers market is highly competitive. Our competition includes Motorola Solutions, Utility Associates, Getac Technology Corporation, Panasonic Corp., Reveal Media, Safe Fleet, Digital Ally Inc., Visual Labs Inc., Intrensic, LLC, as well as Safety Vision, LLC, Rekor Systems Inc., and Genetec Inc.
The market for software solutions to improve public safety agency workflows is both highly fragmented and highly competitive. Our cloud-based digital evidence management system, Axon Evidence, competes with both cloud-based platforms and on-premises based systems designed by third-parties or developed internally by an agency's technology staff. Our competition includes Motorola Solutions, Panasonic Corp., IBM, Oracle, FotoWare, Vidizmo, LLC, NICE, QueTel Corporation, OpenText Corporation, and FileOnQ among others.

8




Key competitive factors in this market include product performance, product features (including live-streaming, GPS tracking, and pre-event buffering), battery life, product quality and warranty, total cost of ownership, data security, data and information workflows, company reputation and financial strength, and relationships with customers.
Productivity and Real-Time Operations — Records Management System (RMS) and Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD): The RMS and CAD markets are highly competitive and highly fragmented. We have identified more than 50 software providers, including Motorola Solutions, Tyler Technologies, Central Square Technologies (formerly Superion, TriTech and Aptean), Northrop Grumman, Hexagon AB, Niche Technology Inc., Caliber Public Safety (parent, Harris Computer Systems), Saab, SOMA Global, RapidDeploy Inc., Sopra Steria, Mark43 Inc, and CSI Technology Group. In addition, not all law enforcement agencies use software for report writing — some still use paper. We believe our network of camera sensors and digital evidence management platform give us a strategic advantage in these product categories. Our Respond offering competes both with real-time operations platforms that ingest body camera video feeds, like Motorola’s CommandCentral Aware, Hitachi's Visualization Suite and Genetec's Citigraf as well as platforms that ingest video feeds exclusively from surveillance cameras, like Rave Mobile Safety, Live Earth and Mutualink among others.
TASER for Professional User Markets: Our CEDs compete with a variety of less-lethal alternatives to firearms, including rubber bullets or rubber baton rounds, such as those made by Combined Systems; pepper spray, pepper spray projectiles, such as those made by Byrna Technologies Inc. (dba Fox Labs), SABRE Corporation, and Mace Security International, Inc.; traditional stun guns, such as those made by UZI and Jolt; hand-held remote restraint devices involving a tether, such as the one made by Wrap Technologies Inc.; laser dazzlers that cause temporary blindness, such as the one made by B.E. Meyers & Co., Inc.; stun grenades, such as those made by Combined Systems, Inc.; long-range acoustic devices, such as the one made by Genasys Inc.; police batons and night sticks, such as those made by Monadnock and by Armament Systems and Procedures, Inc. TASER devices offer advanced technology, versatility, portability, effectiveness, built-in accountability systems, and low injury rates, which enable us to compete effectively against other less-lethal alternatives. TASER devices also offer connectivity to our cloud network, which allows law enforcement agencies and other professional users to more effectively manage their less-lethal programs and automate use-of-force reporting.
The primary competitive factors in this market include a device’s accuracy, effectiveness, reputation, safety, cost, ease of use, and exceptional customer experience. The design maturity of the TASER platform, as well as our development and sale of a two-shot device, are also key competitive differentiators. We are aware of competitors providing competing CED products primarily in international markets.
Virtual Reality (“VR”) De-Escalation Training for Law Enforcement, Corrections and Private Security Markets: Our VR Training platform competes with several other companies in the space who offer simulation scenarios, including simulated training on the use of both lethal and less-lethal alternatives. Our competition in this space includes VirTra Inc., Apex Officer, Laser Shot Inc., InVeris Training Solutions Inc., MILO, Ti Training Corp, Adaptive VR Ltd. (AVRT), V-Armed, Street Smarts VR and WRAP Technologies.
Key competitive factors in this market include scale of content library, integration to additional sensors and devices (e.g. haptic suit, TASER), ease of use, visual fidelity and realism, quality of immersion experience (enhanced by capabilities such as eye tracking and speech recognition) and portability.
TASER for Personal Safety: In the private citizen market, TASER devices compete with firearms and with other less-than-lethal self-defense options such as stun guns and pepper spray-based products including pepper guns and miniature spray cans. Leading competitors in the less-than-lethal space include Byrna Technologies, Inc., Salt Supply Co., PepperBall, Mace, SABRE and Vipertek. The TASER StrikeLight competes in the flashlight category, in which there are dozens, if not hundreds, of competitors, including tactical flashlight providers with and without stun-gun capabilities.
TASER personal safety devices are not stun guns, and have different capabilities, including NMI (neuro-muscular incapacitation) functionality. The broader market for personal safety and home defense is far-reaching, and 

9




categories range from threat detection and accountability (dash and doorbell cameras), to home security (home alarms, locks, and response services) to personal defense (firearms, stun guns, TASER devices, pepper spray, tactical flashlights, and personal alarms), to personal tracking and emergency notification mobile applications. 
The primary benefit of TASER devices is in less-than-lethal stopping power. Other competitive factors include a device’s cost, effectiveness, safety, ease of use, and available training options.
Non-Axon trademarks are property of their respective owners.
Seasonality
We have historically experienced higher net sales in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due primarily to municipal budget cycles. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact the cadence of net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Municipal law enforcement budgets tend to feature a mix of fiscal years that end in either June, September or December. However, historical seasonal patterns, municipal budgets or historical patterns of product introductions should not be considered reliable indicators of our future net sales or financial performance.
Governmental Regulation 
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including, for example, laws and regulations related to: privacy and data protection, security, retention, and deletion; rights of publicity; content; intellectual property; regulation of certain of our CEDs as firearms; advertising; marketing; distribution; electronic contracts and other communications; competition; consumer protection; telecommunications; product liability; taxation; labor and employment; economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions; securities; and online payment services. There are a number of legislative proposals in the U.S., at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties. Foreign laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the U.S.
These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legal and Compliance Risks - A variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could materially and adversely affect our business.”
Radio Spectrum Devices
Certain of our products utilize the radio spectrum to provide wireless voice, data and video communications services. The allocation of spectrum is regulated in the U.S. and other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services and specifically to public safety users. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulates spectrum use by non-federal entities and federal entities. Similarly, countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of radio spectrum and electromagnetic interference, pursuant to their respective national laws. We manufacture and, after receiving the required approvals, we market our products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies.
Axon body worn cameras, docks, fleet vehicle cameras and signal devices are subject to FCC’s rules and regulations. The FCC regulates not only the "intentional radiation" of radio transmitters, but also the "unintentional radiation" of noise from all sorts of electrical equipment. Current Axon products use Bluetooth, WiFi and/or Long-Term Evolution (“LTE”) radio technologies. With the integration of LTE technologies, we must also apply for the approval of private certifications such as Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association certification, required 

10




by FirstNet and other operators. These regulations affect CEDs with Signal technology, including the TASER 7 and TASER 10, SPPM, and future CEDs implementing wireless technology.
Axon and TASER Devices
For our TASER products, we rely on the opinions of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”), including the determination that a device that does not expel projectiles by the action of an explosive is not classified as a firearm.
Federal regulation of sales in the U.S.: All current CED models, with the exception of TASER 10, which launched in January 2023, are not firearms regulated by the ATF, and our consumer products are regulated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The TASER 10 is regulated by the ATF under the Gun Control Act of 1968 and is subject to applicable state and local firearms regulations that are jurisdiction-specific. Axon must maintain a federal firearms license to manufacture and sell the TASER 10, which subjects Axon to periodic compliance inspections by the ATF. License violations discovered by the ATF can result in fines, penalties, warning letters or license revocation. Additionally, if we fail to comply with ATF rules and regulations, the ATF may limit our TASER 10 activities or growth, fine us, or ultimately, suspend our ability to produce and sell the TASER 10 product line. There are currently no federal laws restricting sales of our other currently offered CED products in the U.S.
Axon devices using lithium batteries are subject to U.S.-DOT/UN 38.3 for transportation.
Our CED products are also subject to testing, safety and other standard organizations such as the American National Standards Institute, the International Electrotechnical Commission, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Underwriters Laboratories. These regulations also affect CEDs with Axon Signal technology, including Signal Performance Power Magazine technology, and TASER 7 battery packs.
Federal regulation of international sales: Our CEDs are considered a “crime control” product by the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) for export directly from the U.S. which requires us to obtain an export license from the DOC for the export of our CED devices from the U.S. to any country other than Canada. Future products and services may require classifications from the DOC before they may be shipped internationally. Our inability to obtain DOC export licenses or classifications on a timely basis for sales of our products to our international customers could significantly and adversely affect our international sales. Although TASER 10 is regulated by the ATF for domestic sales, the U.S. DOC has ruled that the product’s unique propulsion design has no impact on its export classification and that the TASER 10 model’s export classification remains consistent with all other TASER CED models.
Federal regulation of foreign national employees: Our CED development and production is also considered controlled “technology” by the U.S. DOC and is categorized as a “deemed export” for any foreign national employees exposed to the technology within the U.S. Consequently, we must obtain export licenses from the DOC for any deemed export within the U.S. made to a foreign national employee exposed to the deemed controlled technology. Deemed export licenses are subject to DOC approvals and issued licenses require annual status reports for the stated employees. Inability to obtain proper licensing could curtail the company’s ability to recruit employees and execute R&D and production related to CED technology.
State and local regulation: Our CEDs are controlled, restricted or, less frequently, prohibited by some state and local governments. As of December 31, 2022, Rhode Island is the only state that prohibits the possession of our TASER-branded devices that are not regulated by the ATF. However, that prohibition was struck down as unconstitutional by a federal court, and new legislation is expected. Additionally, some cities and municipalities also prohibit private citizen possession or use of our CED products. However, with the launch of TASER 10 in January 2023, we may need to comply with additional state and local requirements governing the sale of firearms if that device is sold to non-law enforcement customers.
International regulation of foreign imports and sales: Certain jurisdictions prohibit, restrict, or require a permit for the importation, sale, possession or use of CEDs, including in some countries by law enforcement agencies, limiting our international sales opportunities.

11




U.S. and International regulation of component movements globally: We rely on a global supply chain of components across our product lines with most final assembly occurring in the U.S. Export of these components from abroad is subject to shifting regulatory landscapes imposed by both the foreign government and U.S. authorities upon import. Additionally, certain TASER 10 components are regulated for import into the U.S. by the ATF and are subject to ATF import permits which limits Axon’s ability to source from some suppliers leading to a potential decrease in supply chain agility.
International regulation of foreign-based operations: We maintain foreign operations in several countries globally for purposes of logistics, sales, general and administrative services, and R&D support. Depending on these activities, regulations can include business activity licensing and registration, import permits and recordkeeping, warehousing & storage security and permitting, and government reporting. 
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including restricting the presence of certain substances in our products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of such products. 
The European Union (“EU”) has published Directives on the restriction of certain hazardous substances in electronic and electrical equipment (the “RoHS Directive”) and on electronic and electrical waste management (the “WEEE Directive”). The RoHS Directive restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead. The WEEE Directive directs members of the EU to enact laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electric and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection, recycling, treatment and environmentally responsible disposal of certain products sold into the EU. In addition, similar environmental legislation has been enacted in other jurisdictions, including the U.S. (under federal and state laws) and other countries.
In addition, the EU has defined a regulation for the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals that places responsibility on companies to manage the risks from chemicals contained in products and to provide safety information about such substances. Manufacturers and importers are required to gather information on the properties of the chemical substances in their products and provide for their safe handling. As of January 5, 2021, companies supplying products on the EU market containing substances of very high concern as identified by the EU have to submit information on these products to the European Chemicals Agency. The information in their database is then made available to waste operators and consumers. 
Other countries have adopted chemical restrictions regulations, including but not limited to the U.S., Canada, and Australia. New, or changes in, environmental safety laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant. Any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. 
Privacy Regulations
We are subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can collect, transfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. These laws and regulations often create private rights of action, impose new potential monetary penalties for noncompliance, and may require us to adopt additional contractual obligations as well as restrict our ability to store or process data.

12




We continue to monitor and assess for compliance as the regulatory environment evolves both within the United States and in relevant international markets. Laws and regulations often involve matters central to our business, including:

● | Privacy laws, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation, California’s Consumer Privacy Act and Privacy Rights Act, Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act, Virginia’s Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act and other laws.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Data protection laws passed by many states within the U.S. regarding notification to data subjects or regulators where there is a security breach of personal data.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Data localization or data sovereignty laws requiring that certain data types collected in a particular country be stored or processed within that country.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic, and sometimes inconsistent, interpretations of what constitutes “personal information” enhance the complexity of complying with these regulations across jurisdictions.
Human Capital Resources
Our success depends on the continued service of our employees and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate top talent. To facilitate this, we strive to create a diverse and inclusive environment at Axon, with equitable opportunities for employee growth and development, supported by strong compensation and benefits and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. Axon’s mission is central to our recruiting and retention efforts.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 2,821 full-time employees and 913 temporary employees (temporary employees include contractors, interns, and consultants). During fiscal 2022, the number of full-time employees increased by 673 or 31%, primarily for product support, R&D, and other support organizations.
Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are strong. We closed the year with our regrettable attrition rate(a) at 2.02%, well under the annual goal of 2.5%. More than 90% of employees reported feeling proud to work at Axon during 2022’s employee engagement survey. 

(a) | Regrettable attrition is defined as rolling 12-month attrition of employees rated as top performing in the prior performance rating cycle.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diversity and Inclusion
We embrace diversity, equity and inclusion. A truly innovative workforce needs to be diverse, leverage the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds and experiences, and ensure that all employees are equitably empowered to succeed. We continue to focus on the hiring, retention, development, and advancement of women and underrepresented communities. We are focused on recruiting diverse candidates and on internal talent development of our diverse leaders so that they can advance their careers and move into leadership positions.
Our employee affinity groups are company-sponsored, employee-led communities that address specific needs, priorities, and barriers to success for each community of focus. These groups provide a forum for employees to discuss problems and craft solutions for each community of focus, while also creating leadership and professional development opportunities for members. Throughout 2022 we continued to see active participation in all six of our affinity groups — Axon Allies for LGBTQ+ employees, APIA for Asian Pacific Islander employees, HOLA for Hispanic employees, Axon Mosaic for Black employees, Axon Vets for service veterans, and Women at Axon. Each affinity group is inclusive of employees who identify as members of each community, as well as allies.
In 2022, we formed the Ethics & Equity Advisory Council (EEAC) to ensure that ethics and equity are at the forefront of our services and product development. We believe that our ability to retain our workforce is dependent 

13




upon fostering an environment that is sustainably safe, respectful, fair and inclusive of everyone and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion inside and outside of our business. Internally, we continue to listen to our employees with town hall sessions, provide expert-led webinars, and host community round tables.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is of utmost importance to us. We conduct regular self-assessments and audits to ensure compliance with our health and safety guidelines and regulatory requirements. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a level of work-related injuries as close to zero as possible through continuous investment in our safety programs. We provide protective gear (e.g. eye protection, masks and gloves) as required by applicable standards and as appropriate given employee job duties. 
To promote mental and emotional wellbeing, all full-time employees are provided free, unlimited access by Axon to Ginger. Ginger is a 24/7 resource that includes individualized coaching via text in addition to access to articles and activities offering guidance on maintaining emotional balance throughout tumultuous times.
Additionally, we have a Wellness Incentive Program for our domestic employees that incentivizes healthy lifestyles. The program rewards employees for completing a variety of well-being activities that help foster their financial wellness, mental health, social wellbeing, community engagement and nutrition.
