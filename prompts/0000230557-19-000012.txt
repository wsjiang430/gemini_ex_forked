Item 1. Business.
Overview

Selective Insurance Group, Inc. (referred to as the “Parent”) is a New Jersey holding company incorporated in 1977. Our main office is located in Branchville, New Jersey and the Parent’s common stock is publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “SIGI.” The Parent has ten insurance subsidiaries, nine of which are licensed by various state departments of insurance to write specific lines of property and casualty insurance business as admitted insurance carriers in what is referred to as the standard marketplace. The remaining subsidiary is authorized by various state insurance departments to write property and casualty insurance in the excess and surplus ("E&S") lines market as a non-admitted insurance carrier. Our ten insurance subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Insurance Subsidiaries.” The Parent and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as "we," “us,” or “our” in this document.
In 2018, we were ranked as the 35th largest property and casualty group in the United States based on 2017 net premiums written (“NPW”) in A.M. Best Company’s (“A.M. Best”) annual list of “Top 100 U.S. Property/Casualty Writers.” 
The property and casualty insurance market is highly competitive, with fragmented market share and four main distribution methods: (i) sales through independent insurance agents; (ii) direct sales to personal and commercial customers; (iii) a combination of independent agent and direct sales; and (iv) sales through captive insurance agents that are contracted to work exclusively with one insurance company. In this highly competitive and regulated industry, we focus on sales exclusively through independent agents and have several strategic advantages as follows: 
(i) The true franchise value we have built through our relationships with a small group of independent distribution partners that we refer to as our "ivy league" distribution partners, who collectively have significant market share in the states in which we operate and from whom we expect to gain increasing percentages of the business they write.
(ii) Our unique field model, in which our underwriting, claims, and safety management personnel are located in the same communities as our distribution partners and customers and benefit from sophisticated analytics, technology, and regional and home office support.
(iii) Our investment in technologies that help us enhance overall customer experience and position us to increase retention rates and new business hit ratios over time. Our digital platform allows customers to interact with us in a 24x7 environment in the manner of their choosing. Additionally, we have developed a 360-degree view of our customers, enhancing our ability to provide value-added services, such as proactive messaging in relation to product recalls, potential loss activity, or policy changes. 
(iv) Our deployment of sophisticated underwriting and claims tools that enable our personnel to make better decisions faster, creating greater efficiencies and improving outcomes. Our underwriters receive real-time model driven underwriting and pricing guidance on every account, along with the tools to measure the impact of each decision on their overall portfolio. 
Financial Strength Ratings play a significant role in insurance purchasing recommendations by our independent distribution partners and in decision-making by our customers. Distribution partners generally recommend higher rated carriers to limit their liability for error and omission claims, and customers often have minimum insurer rating requirements in loans, mortgages, and other agreements securing real and personal property. Our Insurance Subsidiaries’ ratings by major rating agency are as follows:

Rating Agency | Financial Strength Rating | Outlook
A.M. Best | A | Stable 
Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings (“S&P”) | A | Stable 
Moody’s Investors Services (“Moody’s”) | A2 | Stable 
Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) | A+ | Stable 

For further discussion on our ratings, please see the “Ratings” section of Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” of this Form 10-K.

We have provided a glossary of terms as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K, which defines certain industry-specific and other terms that are used in this Form 10-K.
Segments
We classify our business into four reportable segments:

• | Standard Commercial Lines, which is comprised of insurance products and services provided in the standard marketplace to commercial enterprises; typically businesses, non-profit organizations, and local government agencies. This business represents 79% of our total insurance operations’ NPW and is sold in 27 states and the District of Columbia. 


• | Standard Personal Lines, which is comprised of insurance products and services provided primarily to individuals acquiring coverage in the standard marketplace. This business represents 12% of our total insurance operations’ NPW and is sold in 15 states. Standard Personal Lines includes flood insurance coverage. We are the fifth largest writer of this coverage through the National Flood Insurance Program (“NFIP”) and write flood business in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 


• | E&S Lines, which is comprised of insurance products and services provided to customers who have not obtained coverage in the standard marketplace. We currently only write commercial lines E&S coverages. This business represents 9% of our total insurance operations’ NPW and is sold in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 


• | Investments, which invests the premiums collected by our insurance operations and amounts generated through our capital management strategies, which include the issuance of debt and equity securities.

We derive substantially all of our income in three ways:

• | Underwriting income/loss from our insurance operations. Underwriting income/loss is comprised of revenues, which are the premiums earned on our insurance products and services, less expenses. Gross premiums are direct premium written ("DPW") plus premiums assumed from other insurers. NPW is equal to gross premiums less premium ceded to reinsurers. NPW is recognized as revenue ratably over a policy’s term as net premiums earned (“NPE”). 

Expenses related to our insurance operations fall into three categories, which are depicted on our Consolidated Statements of Income: (i) "Loss and loss expense incurred," which includes losses associated with claims and all loss expenses incurred for adjusting claims; (ii) "Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs," which includes expenses related to the successful acquisition of insurance policies, such as commissions to our distribution partners and premium taxes, and are recognized ratably over a policy's term; and (iii) "Other insurance expenses," which includes acquisition expenses not captured above, as well as expenses incurred in maintaining policies and policyholder dividends.

• | Net investment income from the investment segment. We generate income from investing insurance premiums and amounts generated through our capital management strategies. Net investment income consists primarily of: (i) interest earned on fixed income investments and preferred stocks; (ii) dividends earned on equity securities; and (iii) other income primarily generated from our alternative investment portfolio. 


• | Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investment securities from the investments segment. Realized gains and losses from the investment portfolios of the Insurance Subsidiaries and the Parent are typically the result of sales, calls, and redemptions. They also include write downs from other-than-temporary impairments (“OTTI”). Due to a change in accounting literature that became effective January 1, 2018, changes in unrealized gains and losses on our equity portfolio are now recognized in income through "Net unrealized losses on equity securities" on our Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Our income is partially offset by: (i) expenses of the Parent that include long-term incentive compensation to employees, interest on our debt obligations, and other general corporate expenses; and (ii) federal income taxes.
We use the combined ratio as the key measure in assessing the performance of our insurance operations. The combined ratio is calculated by adding: (i) the loss and loss expense ratio, which is the ratio of incurred loss and loss expense to NPE; (ii) the expense ratio, which is the ratio of underwriting expenses to NPE; and (iii) the dividend ratio, which is the ratio of policyholder 
5

dividends to NPE. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit and a combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss. The combined ratio does not reflect investment income, federal income taxes, or Parent company income or expense.
We use after-tax net investment income, and net realized and unrealized gains or losses as the key measures in assessing the performance of our investments segment. Our investment philosophy includes setting certain risk and return objectives for the fixed income, equity, and other investment portfolios. We generally review our performance by comparing our returns for each of these components of our portfolio to a weighted-average benchmark of comparable indices.
We also use non-generally accepted accounting principles operating return on equity ("non-GAAP operating ROE") as an important measure of our overall financial performance. We evaluate our segments, in part, based on their contribution to this company metric. Our non-GAAP operating ROE for 2018 was 12.5%, which exceeded our financial target of 12% for 2018. For 2019, we have established a non-GAAP operating ROE target of 12%, which is an appropriate return for our shareholders based on our current estimated weighted average cost of capital, the current interest rate environment, and property and casualty insurance market conditions. For further details regarding our 2018 performance as it relates to return on equity, refer to "Financial Highlights of Results for Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016" in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." of this Form 10-K.
Insurance Operations
Overview

We derive all of our insurance operations revenue from selling insurance products and services to businesses and individuals for premium. The majority of our sales are annual insurance policies. Our most significant cost associated with the sale of insurance policies is our loss and loss expense.
To that end, we establish loss and loss expense reserves that are estimates of the ultimate amounts that we will need to pay in the future for claims and related expenses for insured losses that have already been incurred, but have not yet been settled. Estimating reserves as of any given date requires the application of estimation techniques, involves a considerable degree of judgment, and is an inherently uncertain process. We regularly review our reserving techniques and the overall adequacy of our reserves. For a full discussion regarding our loss reserving process, see "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." of this Form 10-K. 
As part of our risk management efforts associated with the sale of our products and services, we use reinsurance to protect our capital resources and insure us against losses on the risks we underwrite. We use two main reinsurance vehicles: (i) a reinsurance pooling agreement among our Insurance Subsidiaries in which each company shares in premiums and losses based on certain specified percentages; and (ii) reinsurance contracts and arrangements with third parties that cover various policies that we issue to our customers. For information regarding reinsurance treaties and agreements, see "Reinsurance" in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." of this Form 10-K. 
Insurance Operations Products and Services
The types of insurance we sell in our insurance operations fall into two broad categories: 

• | Property insurance, which generally covers the financial consequences of accidental loss of an insured’s real and/or personal property. Property claims are generally reported and settled in a relatively short period of time. 


• | Casualty insurance, which generally covers the financial consequences of employee injuries in the course of employment and bodily injury and/or property damage to a third party as a result of an insured’s negligent acts, omissions, or legal liabilities. Casualty claims may take several years, and for some casualty claims even several decades, to be reported and settled. 

6

We underwrite our business primarily through traditional insurance. The following table shows the principal types of policies we write:

Types of Policies | Category of Insurance | Standard Commercial Lines | Standard Personal Lines | E&S Lines
Commercial Property (including Inland Marine) | Property | X | | X 
Commercial Automobile | Property/Casualty | X | | X 
General Liability (including Excess Liability/Umbrella) | Casualty | X | | X 
Workers Compensation | Casualty | X | | 
Businessowners' Policy | Property/Casualty | X | | 
Bonds (Fidelity and Surety) | Casualty | X | | 
Homeowners | Property/Casualty | | X | 
Personal Automobile | Property/Casualty | | X | 
Personal Umbrella | Casualty | | X | 
Flood1 | Property | X | X | 

1Flood insurance premiums and losses are 100% ceded to the Federal Government’s Write Your Own Program ("WYO") of the NFIP. The results of our Standard Personal Lines and Standard Commercial Lines flood operations are reported solely within our Standard Personal Lines segment results.
Product Development and Pricing
Our insurance policies are contracts that specify the coverage provided to our insured, such as what we will pay to, or on behalf of, the insured upon a covered loss. We develop our coverages by: (i) adopting forms created or filed by statistical rating agencies or other third parties, notably Insurance Services Office, Inc. (“ISO”), American Association of Insurance Services, Inc. ("AAIS"), and the National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. ("NCCI"); (ii) independently creating our own coverage forms; or (iii) modifying third-party forms. 
Since our policies provide coverage for future events, we do not know what our actual costs for a policy will be at the time we underwrite and issue it. Therefore, determining the prices to charge for our coverages involves consideration of many variables. In certain cases, we adopt rating structures and loss costs filed by statistical rating agencies, such as ISO and NCCI. We supplement this with detailed analyses of our own historical statistical data, factoring in loss trends and other expected impacts. We then load these expected loss costs for our own expenses and profit provision. In other cases, we develop rating structures and rates based upon a combination of our own experience and competitors information. Generally speaking, our approach is to rely upon our own experience to the full extent we deem it statistically credible.
To supplement our rating structures, we have developed predictive models for many of our Standard Commercial and Standard Personal Lines. Predictive models analyze historical statistical data regarding our customers and their loss experience to model additional risk characteristics that drive loss experience. These models rely upon more advanced statistical analysis and rigorous testing. We use the output of these models to group our policies, or potential policies, based upon their expected loss potential. In other cases, we use these models to develop factors in our rating plan. These models' predictive capabilities are limited by the amount and quality of the available statistical data, so they may be supplemented with competitive information or underwriting judgment. 
Customers and Customer Markets
We categorize our Standard Commercial Lines customers into the following strategic business units ("SBUs"):

 | Percentage of Standard Commercial Lines | Description 
Contractors | 39% | General contractors and trade contractors 
Mercantile and Services | 25% | Focuses on retail, office, service businesses, restaurants, golf courses, and hotels
Community and Public Services | 18% | Focuses on public entities, social services, religious institutions, and schools 
Manufacturing and Wholesale | 17% | Includes manufacturers, wholesalers, and distributors 
Bonds | 1% | Includes fidelity and surety 
Total Standard Commercial Lines | 100% | 

We do not categorize our Standard Personal Line customers or our E&S Line customers by SBU.
7

The following are general guidelines that can be used as indicators of the approximate size of our customers: 

• | The average Standard Commercial Lines premium per customer is approximately $12,000.


• | The average Standard Personal Lines premium per customer is approximately $2,000.


• | The average E&S Lines premium per policy is approximately $3,000.

No one customer accounts for 10% or more of our insurance operations in the aggregate.
Geographic Markets
We sell in the following geographic markets:

• | Standard Commercial Lines products and services are sold in 27 states located in the Eastern, Midwestern, and Southwestern regions of the United States and the District of Columbia.


• | Standard Personal Lines products and services are sold in 15 states located in the Eastern, Midwestern, and Southwestern regions of the United States, except for the flood portion of this segment, which is sold in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.


• | E&S Lines products and services are sold in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

We support geographically diversified business from our corporate headquarters in Branchville, New Jersey, and our six regional branches (referred to as our “Regions”). The table below lists our Regions and their office locations:

Region | Office Location 
Heartland | Carmel, Indiana 
New Jersey | Hamilton, New Jersey 
Northeast | Branchville, New Jersey 
Mid-Atlantic | Allentown, Pennsylvania and Hunt Valley, Maryland
Southern | Charlotte, North Carolina 
Southwest | Scottsdale, Arizona 

 In addition, our E&S Lines are supported by office locations in Horsham, Pennsylvania and Scottsdale, Arizona.
Distribution Channel
We sell our insurance products and services through the following types of distribution partners:

• | Standard Commercial Lines: independent retail agents; 


• | Standard Personal Lines: independent retail agents; and 


• | E&S Lines: wholesale general agents. 

We pay our distribution partners commissions calculated as a percentage of DPW, and in some cases on profitability or other consideration for business placed with us. We seek to compensate them fairly and in a manner consistent with market practices. No one distribution partner is responsible for 10% or more of our combined insurance operations' premium. Our top 20 distribution partners generated approximately 30% of our NPW in 2018.
Our customers rely heavily on our distribution partners and some do not differentiate between their insurance agent and their insurance carrier, so developing brand recognition particularly with these types of customers can be difficult . We continue to evolve our service model, post policy-acquisition, with an increasing focus on the customer. Our goal is to provide our customers with 24/7 access to transactional capabilities and account information. Customers expect this level of access from us because of the technological and service improvements in retail and other consumer sectors. While many insurers offer such solutions in the personal lines space, we want to be a leader in digital and customer experience in all three segments of our insurance operations. As part of our digital strategy, we provide customers with a mobile application and a web-based portal that permit our customers on demand self-service access to basic account information, pay their bills electronically, and report claims. In addition, we are able to provide value-added services, such as proactive messaging in relation to product recalls, potential loss activity, or policy changes. These efforts will permit us to offer customers an improved shared experience with our independent distribution partners, and better position us to more directly demonstrate our value proposition to our customers and distribution partners.

Independent Retail Agents
According to a 2018 study by the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, independent retail insurance agents and brokers write approximately 84% of standard commercial lines insurance and 35% of standard personal lines insurance in the United States. We believe that independent retail insurance agents, which comprise the bulk of our independent distribution partners, will remain a significant force in overall insurance industry premium production because they represent more than one insurance carrier and provide a wider choice of commercial and personal lines insurance products and risk-based consultation to customers. 
We currently have 1,320 distribution partners selling our Standard Commercial Lines business, and 720 of these distribution partners also sell our Standard Personal Lines business. These 1,320 distribution partners sell our products and services through approximately 2,200 office locations. We also have 6,000 retail agents selling our flood insurance products.
In our independently administered 2018 survey, we received an overall satisfaction score of 8.7 out of 10 from our standard market distribution partners. We believe this score highlights the satisfaction of our independent distribution partners with our products, the ease of reporting claims, and the professionalism and effectiveness of our employees.
Wholesale General Agents
Our distribution partners for our E&S Lines are 90 wholesale general agents with a combined 250 office locations. We have granted limited binding authority to the wholesale general agents for business that meets our prescribed underwriting and pricing guidelines. Our wholesale general agents submit brokerage business to us for risk acceptability, terms and conditions, and pricing. 
Marketing
Our primary marketing strategy is to:

• | Use an empowered field underwriting model to provide our Standard Commercial Lines retail distribution partners with resources within close geographic proximity to their businesses and our mutual customers. For further discussion on this, see the “Field Model and Technology” section below. 


• | Develop close relationships with each distribution partner, particularly their principals and producers by: (i) soliciting their feedback on products and services; (ii) advising them concerning our product developments; and (iii) providing education and development focusing on producer recruitment, sales training, enhancing customer experience, online marketing, and distribution operations. 


• | Develop with each distribution partner, and then carefully monitor, annual goals regarding: (i) types and mix of risks placed with us; (ii) new business and renewal retention expectations; (iii) customer service; (iv) pricing of their in-force book and changes in renewal prices; and (v) profitability of business placed with us. 


• | Develop brand recognition with our customers through our marketing efforts to be recognized as a proactive risk manager that provides the value-added services that customers seek, which include proactive communication, and providing exceptional products and services that help position us as a leader in the marketplace.

Technology and Field Model
Technology
We leverage the use of technology in our business. We have made significant investments in information technology platforms, integrated systems, internet-based applications, and predictive modeling initiatives. We do this to provide:

• | Our distribution partners and customers with access to accurate business information and the ability to process certain transactions from their locations, seamlessly integrating those transactions into our systems;


• | Our underwriters with targeted underwriting and pricing tools to enhance profitability while growing the business;


• | Our workers compensation claims adjusters with predictive tools to indicate when claims are likely to escalate to better serve our customers;


• | Our Special Investigations Unit ("SIU") investigators access to our business intelligence systems to better identify claims with potential fraudulent activities;

9


• | Our claims recovery and subrogation departments with the ability to expand and enhance their models through the use of our business intelligence systems; and


• | Our customers with 24x7 access to transactional capabilities and information through a web-based customer portal and a customer mobile application.

We manage our information technology projects through an Enterprise Project Management Office (“EPMO”) governance model. The EPMO is supported by certified project managers who apply methodologies to: (i) communicate project management standards; (ii) provide project management training and tools; (iii) manage projects; (iv) review project status, the projected net present value of project benefits, if applicable, and external and internal costs; and (v) provide non-technology project management consulting services to the rest of the organization. The EPMO, which includes senior management representatives from all major business areas, corporate functions, and information technology, meets regularly to review all major initiatives and receives reports on the status of other projects. We believe the EPMO is an important factor in the success of our technology implementation. 
Our primary technology operations are located in Branchville, New Jersey and Glastonbury, Connecticut. We have agreements with multiple consulting, information technology, and service providers for supplemental staffing services. Collectively, these providers supply approximately 50% of our skilled technology capacity and are principally based in the U.S., although we do contract with some service providers who are based, or utilize resources, outside the U.S. We retain management oversight of all projects and ongoing information technology production operations. We believe we would be able to manage an efficient transition to new vendors without significant impact to our operations if we terminated an existing vendor.

Field Model
To support our distribution partners, we employ a field model for both underwriting and claims, with various employees usually working from home offices near our distribution partners. We believe that we build better and stronger relationships with our distribution partners because of the close proximity of our field employees, and the resulting direct interaction with our distribution partners and customers. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,290 employees, of which 590 worked in the field, 860 worked in one of our regional offices, and the remainder worked in our corporate office.
Underwriting Process
Our underwriting process requires communication and interaction among:

• | Our Regions, which together with our corporate underwriting and actuarial departments, jointly establish and execute upon the following for our Standard Commercial Lines business: (i) annual premium and pricing goals; (ii) specific new business targets by distribution partner; and (iii) profit improvement plans as needed across our business segments, lines, states, and/or distribution partners; 


• | Our corporate underwriting department, which develops our underwriting appetite, products, policy forms, pricing, and underwriting guidelines for our standard market business;


• | Our corporate actuaries who assist in the determination of rate and pricing levels, while monitoring pricing and profitability along with the Regions, corporate underwriting department, and business intelligence staff for our standard and E&S market business;


• | Our distribution partners, which include independent retail agents for our standard market business and wholesale general agents for our E&S market business, that provide front-line underwriting within our prescribed guidelines;


• | Our Agency Management Specialists (“AMSs”), who: (i) manage the growth and profitability of business that their assigned distribution partners write with us; and (ii) perform field underwriting for new Standard Commercial Lines business; 


• | Our field operations leadership, who have oversight of the AMS production team for Standard Commercial Lines, ensure that: (i) annual profit and growth plans are developed on a state by state basis; (ii) the achievement of these state plans are monitored at the state, AMS territory and account level; and (iii) individual agency plans are developed and monitored for achievement annually; 


• | Our Standard Commercial Lines small business teams that are responsible for handling: (i) new business in need of review that was submitted by our distribution partners through our automated underwriting platform, One & Done®; and (ii) other new small accounts and middle market accounts with low underwriting complexity; 

10


• | Our Safety Management Specialists (“SMSs”), who provide a wide range of front-line safety management services to our Standard Commercial Lines customers as discussed more fully below;


• | Our regional underwriters, who manage our in-force policies for their assigned Standard Commercial Lines distribution partners, including, but not limited to, managing profitability and pricing levels within their portfolios by developing policy-specific pricing;


• | Our managers and underwriters, who are responsible for new business, renewal underwriting and service needs for our large Standard Commercial Lines accounts, including those written with alternative risk transfer techniques for our distribution partners;


• | Our premium auditors, who supplement the underwriting process by working with insureds to accurately audit exposures for certain Standard Commercial Lines policies that we write;


• | Our field technical coordinators, who are responsible for technology assistance and training to aid our employees and standard market distribution partners;


• | Our Personal Lines Marketing Specialists (“PLMSs”), who have primary responsibility for identifying new opportunities to grow our Standard Personal Lines; and


• | Our E&S territory managers, who have primary responsibility for identifying new opportunities to grow our E&S Lines.

We have an underwriting service center (“USC”) located in Richmond, Virginia. The USC assists our distribution partners by servicing certain Standard Commercial and Personal Lines accounts. At the USC, many of our employees are licensed agents who respond to customer inquiries about insurance coverage, billing transactions, and other matters. For the convenience of using the USC and our handling of certain transactions, our distribution partners agree to receive a slightly lower than standard commission for the premium associated with the USC. As of December 31, 2018, our USC was servicing Standard Commercial Lines NPW of $52.0 million and Standard Personal Lines NPW of $28.9 million. The $80.9 million total serviced by the USC represents 3% of our total NPW.
Our field model provides a wide range of front-line safety management services focused on improving a Standard Commercial Lines insured’s safety and risk management programs. During 2018, we introduced: (i) our Selective® Drive program to our commercial automobile policyholders. This product assists with logistics management and improved safety by tracking and scoring individual drivers based on driving attributes, including phone usage while the vehicle is in motion; and (ii) a web-based cybersecurity training program that is currently being piloted with our agents to help them better protect their agencies and better safeguard our data and systems. In addition, our service mark “Safety Management: Solutions for a safer workplace”SM includes: (i) risk evaluation and improvement surveys intended to evaluate potential exposures and provide solutions for mitigation; (ii) internet-based safety management educational resources, including a large library of coverage-specific safety materials, videos and online courses, such as defensive driving and employee educational safety courses; (iii) thermographic infrared surveys aimed at identifying electrical hazards; and (iv) Occupational Safety and Health Administration construction and general industry certification training. Risk improvement efforts for existing customers are designed to improve loss experience and policyholder retention through valuable ongoing consultative service. Our safety management goal is to work with our customers to identify, mitigate, and eliminate potential loss exposures.
Claims Management
Effective, fair, and timely claims management is one of the most important services that we provide to our customers and distribution partners. It is also one of the critical factors in achieving underwriting profitability. We have structured our claims organization to emphasize: (i) cost-effective delivery of claims services and control of loss and loss expense; and (ii) maintenance of timely and adequate claims reserves. In connection with our Standard Commercial Lines and Standard Personal Lines, we achieve better claim outcomes through a field model that locates claim representatives in close proximity to our customers and distribution partners. 
In 2018, we introduced the Swift Claims Handling process ("SWIFT") where parties can opt-in to having low-severity automobile or property claims handled entirely through email. This accelerates the claims handling process and improves the customer experience. Over 4,000 individuals have opted into having their claims managed through SWIFT, with payment issuance often occurring as soon as 24 hours from submission.
11

We have a claims service center (“CSC”), co-located with the USC, in Richmond, Virginia. The CSC receives first notices of loss from our customers and claimants related to our Standard Commercial Lines and Standard Personal Lines and manages routine automobile and property claims with no injuries. The CSC is designed to help: (i) reduce the claims settlement time on first- and third-party automobile property damage claims; (ii) increase the use of body shops, glass repair shops, and car rental agencies that have contracted with us at discounted rates and specified service levels; (iii) handle and settle small property claims; and (iv) investigate and negotiate auto liability claims. The CSC, as appropriate, will assign claims to the appropriate regional claims office or other specialized area within our claims organization.
Claims Management Specialists (“CMSs”) are responsible for investigating and resolving the majority of our standard marketplace commercial automobile bodily injury, general liability, and property losses with low severities. We also have Property Claims Specialists ("PCSs") to handle property claims with severities ranging from $10,000 to $100,000. They also form the basis of our catastrophe response team. Strategically located throughout our footprint, CMSs and PCSs are able to provide highly responsive customer and distribution partner service to quickly resolve claims within their authority.
Our E&S claims processing is consistent with our Standard Commercial Lines and Standard Personal Lines claims processing. E&S claims are handled in our standard lines regional offices, as well as in our Complex Claims and Litigation Unit ("CCU") discussed below, and are segregated by line of business (property and liability), litigation, and complexity. 
Our Quality Assurance Unit conducts monthly file reviews on all of our operations to validate compliance with our quality claims handling standards. Complex and litigated claims oversight is handled by specialists within the CCU. 
We have implemented specialized claims handling as follows:

• | Liability claims with high severity or technically complex losses are handled by the CCU. The CCU specialists are primarily field-based employees, and handle losses based on injury type or with expected severities greater than $250,000 in our Standard Commercial Lines and Standard Personal Lines, and severities greater than $100,000 in our E&S Lines. 


• | Litigated matters not meeting the CCU criteria are handled within our litigation unit. Teams of litigation adjusters are aligned based upon jurisdictional knowledge and technical experience and are supervised by regional litigation managers. These claims are segregated from the CMSs to allow for focused management and application of specific technical expertise. 


• | Workers compensation claims handling is centralized in Charlotte, North Carolina. Jurisdictionally trained and aligned medical-only and lost-time adjusters manage non-complex workers compensation claims within our footprint. Claims with high exposure and/or significant escalation risk are referred to the workers compensation strategic case management unit. 


• | Low severity/high volume property claims are handled by the CSC. Certain complex claims that do not involve structural damage (i.e. employee dishonesty and equipment breakdown losses) are handled by a small group of specialists in the CSC. 


• | The Large Loss Unit ("LLU") handles complex property claims, typically those in excess of $100,000.


• | All asbestos and environmental claims are referred to our specialized corporate Environmental Unit, which also handles other latent claims.


• | The Construction Defect Unit unit handles larger, complex construction defect claims.


• | All abuse and molestation claims have been centralized in one unit so as to apply the highest level of expertise possible to this emerging risk within the industry.

This structure allows us to provide experienced adjusting to each claim category.
12

The SIU, which investigates potential insurance fraud and abuse, and furthers efforts by regulatory bodies and trade associations to curtail the cost of fraud, supports all insurance operations. We have developed a proprietary SIU fraud detection model that identifies the potential fraud cases early on in the life of the claim. The SIU adheres to uniform internal procedures to improve detection and take action on potentially fraudulent claims. It is our practice to notify the proper authorities of SIU findings, which we believe sends a clear message that we will not tolerate fraud against us or our customers. The SIU supervises anti-fraud training for all claims adjusters and AMSs.
Insurance Operations Competition
We face substantial competition in the insurance marketplace, including from public, private, and mutual insurance companies, which in some cases may have lower cost of capital than we do. Many of our competitors, like us, rely on partners for the distribution of their products and services. Other insurance carriers either employ their own agents who only represent them or use a combination of distribution partners, captive agents, and direct marketing. The following provides information on the competition facing each of our insurance segments:
Standard Commercial Lines
The Standard Commercial Lines property and casualty insurance market is highly competitive and market share is fragmented among many companies. We compete with primarily two types of companies, mostly on the basis of price, coverage terms, claims service, customer experience, safety management services, ease of technology usage, and financial ratings:

• | Regional insurers, such as Acuity Insurance, American Family Insurance Group, Auto-Owners Insurance, Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Erie Indemnity Company, The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc., United Fire Group, Inc., and Westfield Insurance.

Insurance Regulation

Primary Oversight by the States in Which We Operate
Our insurance operations are heavily regulated. The primary public policy behind insurance regulation is the protection of policyholders and claimants against insurer insolvency and inappropriate business practices. Insurance regulation typically prioritizes policyholder and claimant protection over all other constituencies, including shareholders. By virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, Congress has largely delegated insurance regulation to the various states. The primary market conduct and financial regulators of our Insurance Subsidiaries are the departments of insurance in the states in which they are organized and licensed. The types of activities that are regulated by the states include:

• | Pricing and underwriting practices;


• | Claims practices;


• | Exiting geographic markets and/or canceling or non-renewing policies;


• | Assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds and other mandatory assigned risks and reinsurance;


• | The types, quality and concentration of investments we make;


• | Minimum capital requirements for the Insurance Subsidiaries;


• | Dividends from our Insurance Subsidiaries to the Parent; and


• | Privacy and data security.

For additional discussion of the broad regulatory, administrative, and supervisory powers of the various departments of insurance, refer to the risk factor that discusses regulation in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” of this Form 10-K.
Our various state insurance regulators are members of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). The NAIC has codified statutory accounting principles ("SAP") and other accounting reporting formats and drafts model insurance laws and regulations governing insurance companies. An NAIC model only becomes law when it is enacted in the various state legislatures or promulgated as a regulation by the state insurance department. The adoption of certain NAIC model laws and regulations, however, is a key aspect of the NAIC Financial Regulations Standards and Accreditation Program.
NAIC Monitoring Tools
Among the NAIC's various financial monitoring tools that are material to the regulators in states in which our Insurance Subsidiaries are organized are the following:

• | The Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS"). IRIS identifies 13 industry financial ratios and specifies “usual values” for each ratio. Departure from the usual values on four or more of the financial ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance departments about certain aspects of the insurer's business. Our Insurance Subsidiaries have consistently met the majority of the IRIS ratio tests. 


• | Risk-Based Capital. Risk-based capital is measured by four major areas of risk to which property and casualty insurers are exposed: (i) asset risk; (ii) credit risk; (iii) underwriting risk; and (iv) off-balance sheet risk. Insurers face a steadily increasing amount of regulatory scrutiny and potential intervention as their total adjusted capital declines below three times their "Authorized Control Level." Based on our 2018 statutory financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with SAP, the total adjusted capital for each of our Insurance Subsidiaries substantially exceeded three times their Authorized Control Level. 


• | Annual Financial Reporting Regulation (referred to as the "Model Audit Rule"). The Model Audit Rule, which is modeled closely on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended ("Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), regulates: (i) auditor independence; (ii) corporate governance; and (iii) internal control over financial reporting. As permitted under the Model Audit Rule, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Parent also serves as the audit committee of each of our Insurance Subsidiaries. 


• | Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ("ORSA"). ORSA requires insurers to maintain a framework for identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing, and reporting on the “material and relevant risks” associated with the insurers' (or insurance groups') current and future business plans. ORSA, which has been adopted by the state insurance regulators of our Insurance Subsidiaries, requires companies to file an internal assessment of their solvency with insurance regulators annually. Although no specific capital adequacy standard is currently articulated in ORSA, it is possible that such standard will be developed over time and may increase insurers' minimum capital requirements, which could adversely impact our growth and return on equity. 

14

In addition to the formal regulation above, we are subject to capital adequacy monitoring by rating agencies, for example, Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio ("BCAR") and S&P's capital model. BCAR, which was developed by A.M. Best, and S&P's capital model examine the strength of an insurer's balance sheet and compare available capital to estimated required capital at various probability or rating levels. The regulatory and rating agency models differ from each other in their design. Although the results of each model show similar direction as circumstances change, they react differently to changes in economic conditions, underwriting and investment portfolio mix, and capital, and are also subject to change as the rating agencies update and change their capital adequacy models and requirements over time. This model divergence, combined with updates and changes to the rating agency capital adequacy models over time, can complicate decisions around management of our capital, risk profile, and growth objectives.
Federal Regulation
Notable federal legislation and administrative policies that affect the insurance industry are:

• | McCarran-Ferguson Act;


• | Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act ("TRIPRA");


• | Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”); and


• | Various privacy laws that apply to us because we have personal non-public information, including the:


◦ | Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act;


◦ | Fair Credit Reporting Act;


◦ | Drivers Privacy Protection Act; and


◦ | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

Like all businesses, we are required to enforce the economic and trade sanctions of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). 
The Mitigation Division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") oversees the NFIP's WYO, which was created by an act of Congress. Under the program, all losses are 100% reinsured by the Federal government and we receive an expense allowance for flood policies written and a servicing fee for flood claims administered .  Congress sets the WYO's budgeting, rules, and rating parameters.  The program has been extended several times since its 2018 expiration, and it currently expires on May 31, 2019. While short-term lapses impacting our ability to service NFIP policies may occur from time-to-time, we do not expect a long-term disruption to the program. We continue to participate in the public policy debate to achieve a long-term meaningful program extension.
In response to the financial markets crises in 2008 and 2009, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010. This law provided for, among other things, the following:

• | The establishment of the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) under the United States Department of the Treasury;


• | Federal Reserve oversight of financial services firms designated as systemically important; and


• | Corporate governance reforms for publicly-traded companies.

The FIO, the Federal Reserve, state regulators, and other regulatory bodies have been developing models for capital standards, negotiated a covered agreement with the European Union that, among other things, impacted reinsurance collateral, and have been gathering data as required under the Dodd-Frank Act. We continue to monitor and be actively involved in the industry and public policy discussions around federal and international insurance regulatory developments to ensure that the state regulatory system established under the McCarran-Ferguson Act is maintained.
For additional information on the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, refer to the risk factor related to this legislation within Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” of this Form 10-K.
International Regulation
We believe that development of global capital standards will influence the development of similar standards by domestic regulators. Notable international developments include the following:

• | In 2014, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors proposed Basic Capital Standards for Global Systemically Important Insurers as well as a uniform capital framework for internationally active insurers; and


• | The European Union enacted Solvency II, which sets out new requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers operating in Europe, which was implemented in 2016.

Investments Segment
Our Investments segment seeks to generate net investment income by investing the premiums we receive from our insurance operations and the amounts generated through our capital management strategies, which may include the issuance of debt and equity securities. Proceeds are used to satisfy obligations to our customers, our shareholders, and our debt holders, among others. 
At December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted of the following:

Category of Investment | | | | 
($ in millions, except invested assets per dollar of stockholders' equity) | Carrying Value | | % of InvestmentPortfolio
Fixed income securities | $ | 5,310.2 | | | 89 
Equity securities | 147.7 | | | 2
Short-term investments | 323.9 | | | 6
Other investments, including alternatives | 178.9 | | | 3
Total | $ | 5,960.7 | | | 100
Invested assets per dollar of stockholders' equity | $ | 3.33 | | | 


Our investment philosophy includes certain net investment income, total return, and risk objectives for our fixed income, equity, and other investment portfolios. Our investment strategies are managed by our internal investment management team, and are executed by relationships with multiple external investment advisers. 
During 2018, we were able to increase our after-tax pretax book yield on our core fixed income portfolio by 47 basis points as we tactically positioned the investment portfolio to take advantage of rising rates without increasing credit risk or extending the duration of the portfolio. As an example, approximately 16% of the fixed-income portfolio is in floating rate securities, which reset principally on 90-day LIBOR. The book yield on these securities has benefited from the 111 basis point increase in 90-day LIBOR in 2018. Also, we actively managed the investment portfolio with an emphasis on a portion of our portfolio that we refer to as risk assets. Our risk assets include public equity, high-yield fixed income securities, and alternative investments. Our active management included trimming our exposure to public equities and high yield fixed-income securities to 7.2% on December 31, 2018, from 7.9% on December 31, 2017. Overall, we have been gradually diversifying our portfolio, and will work towards modestly increasing our risk asset allocation over time, up to approximately 10% of our invested assets, depending on market conditions. 
For further information regarding our risks associated with the overall investment portfolio, see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” and Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” of this Form 10-K. For additional information about investments, see the section entitled, “Investments Segment,” in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” and Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Note 5. of this Form 10-K.

Enterprise Risk Management
As a property and casualty holding company, our Insurance Subsidiaries are in the business of assuming risk. We categorize our major risks into the following five broad categories:

• | Asset risk, which stems primarily from our investment portfolio and reinsurance recoverables and includes credit and market risk;


• | Underwriting risk, which is the risk that the insured losses are higher than our expectations, including:


◦ | Losses from inadequate loss reserves;


◦ | Larger than expected non-catastrophe current accident year losses; and


◦ | Catastrophe losses that exceed our expectations or our reinsurance treaty limits.


• | Liquidity risk, which is the risk we will be unable to meet contractual obligations as they become due because we are unable to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding without incurring unacceptable losses;


• | Emerging risks, which are new and known but evolving risks that may have a significant impact on our financial strength, reputation, or long-term strategy, potentially including U.S. and global economic concerns; and

16


• | Other risks, including a broad range of operational risks that can be difficult to quantify, such as legal, regulatory, reputational, and strategic risks as well as the risk of fraud, human failure, and failure of controls and systems, including, for example a rapidly evolving cyber security risk.

Our internal control framework operates with the three lines of defense model. The first line of defense consists of individual functions that deliberately assume risks and own and manage that risk on a day-to-day and business operational basis. The second line of defense is responsible for risk oversight and also supports the first line to understand and manage risk. A dedicated risk team led by the Chief Risk Officer is responsible for this second line and reports to the Chief Financial Officer. The third line of defense is our Internal Audit team, which provides independent, objective assurance as to the assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control environment. It also coordinates risk-based audits and compliance reviews and other specific initiatives to evaluate and address risk within targeted areas of our business.
We use Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) as part of our governance and control process to take an entity-wide view of our major risks and their impact. Our ERM framework is designed to identify, measure, report, and monitor our major risks and develop appropriate responses to support successful execution of our business strategy. 

Our Board oversees our ERM process, while the Executive Risk Committee is responsible for the holistic evaluation, management, and supervision of our aggregated risk profile and determination of future risk management actions in support of overall risk appetite.  In addition to the Board’s oversight of the ERM process, various committees of the Board oversee risks specific to their areas of supervision and report their activities and findings to the full Board. The Executive Risk Committee uses various management committees for detailed analysis and management of specific major risks.  The Executive Risk Committee primarily consists of the Chief Executive Officer, the President and Chief Operating Officer, their direct reports and key operational leaders, each of whom is responsible for management of risk in his or her respective area, and the Chief Risk Officer.  
In addition to the various committees and the governance process over the ERM process, we believe that high-quality and effective ERM is best achieved when it is a shared cultural value throughout the organization. We consider ERM to be a key process that is the responsibility of every employee. We have developed and use tools and processes that we believe support a culture of risk management and create a robust framework of ERM within our organization. In addition, our compensation policies and practices, as well as our governance framework, including our Board's leadership structure, are designed to support our overall risk appetite and strategy. Our ERM processes and practices help us to identify potential events that may affect us, quantify, evaluate and manage the risks to which we are exposed, and provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of our objectives. 
We rely on quantitative and qualitative tools to identify, prioritize, and manage our major risks including proprietary and third-party computer modeling as well as various other analyses. The Executive Risk Committee meets at least quarterly and reviews and discusses various aspects and the interrelation of Selective’s major risks, including, but not limited to, capital modeling results, capital adequacy, risk metrics, emerging risks, and sensitivity analysis.  Consistent with the requirements of state insurance regulators, our Insurance Subsidiaries annually file their ORSA report, which is an internal assessment of our Insurance Subsidiaries' solvency. The Chief Risk Officer develops the report in coordination with members of the Executive Risk Committee, and the report is provided to the Board. The Chief Risk Officer reports on the Executive Risk Committee's activities, analyses, and findings to the Board or the appropriate Board Committee, and provides a quarterly update on certain risk metrics.
We believe that our risk governance structure facilitates strong risk dialogue across all levels and disciplines of the organization and promotes robust risk management practices. All of our strategies and controls, however, have inherent limitations. We cannot be certain that an event or series of unanticipated events will not occur and result in losses greater than we expect and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. An investor should carefully consider the risks and all of the other information included in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”, Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.", and Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of this Form 10-K.
Reports to Security Holders
