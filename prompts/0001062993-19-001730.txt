Overview of Our Business 
 We are headquartered in Shanghai, China. Since the restructuring of our company in September 2018, our primary business, which is carried out by Taishan Muren, our newly acquired business, is:

to develop and market products, such as sauces, from herbs and spices that we grow in China; and

Through Shandong Greenpia, the Company entered into exclusive VIE agreements with Shenzhen Lorain and its shareholders that give the Company the ability to substantially influence Shenzhen Lorain's daily operations and financial affairs and appoint its senior executives. The Company is considered the primary beneficiary of Shenzhen Lorain and it consolidates its accounts as a VIE.

 We also offer a variety of food and beverage products, including packaged sauce, tea and brown rice syrup, to consumers and foodservice businesses. 
 Our spice, sauce, beverage and tea products business is held by our newly acquired company, Taishan Muren. 
 We also offered convenience food products in 2018 and discontinued this offering on December 10, 2018.
 Our Manufacturing Facilities
 General
 We currently manufacture our products in Taishan City, Guangdong Province.
The following table indicates the year that operations commenced at each of the facilities and the size of the facilities. 
 
Facility | Year Operations Commenced | Facility Size (square meters)
---------------------+---------------------------+------------------------------

Luotian Lorain ** | 2003 | 9,558 

* Acquired in September 2018. 
** Operations discontinued in December 2018.
Production Lines
We currently manufacture our products using production lines. The production process for our sauce products involves sorting, cleaning the raw spice, mixing the spice based on our special formula, and grinding, boiling and final packaging. The production process for our dry spice products involves sorting, cleaning the raw spice and drying. We outsource the production of brown rice syrup and tea bag to third party factories, and we provide the manufacturer with the recipe and products standards.
 The following table shows the number and types of production lines, the types of products produced and the production capacity as of the date of this report:

Facility | Production Lines | Product Portfolio | Capacity 
--------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Taishan Muren | 1 sauce line and 1 drying production line | Sauce and dried spice | Production line with 10 tons of production capacity and herb drying production line of 25 tons of production capacity.

 We operate our production lines year round.
 Agricultural Operations
 We began growing herbs and spices by leasing land of 1,949 acres in Taishan City since 2016. We grow 32 species spices including roselle, mint, curry, pandan leave, lemon, citronella and others.
Raw Materials 
 Our Supply Sources
 Our business depends on obtaining a reliable supply of various agricultural products of spice. We believe that our raw materials are currently in adequate supply.
 We obtain our agricultural raw materials primarily from our self-supply. We produced approximately 440 metric tons and 270 tons of spice from our own agricultural operations in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 We select suppliers based on price and product quality. We typically rely on numerous domestic suppliers, including some with whom we have a long-term relationship. Our suppliers generally include wholesale agricultural product companies, food production companies and tea bag processing companies. Our top ten suppliers accounted for 81.2% and 12.1% of the total procurement in 2018 and 2017 in value terms, respectively. We purchase rice syrup and tea bags from suppliers and farmers pursuant to supply contracts and underlying purchase orders. We have not entered into any long-term contracts with any of our suppliers.
 Our Customers 
 Our products are sold exclusively in Chinese domestic markets. Our top ten customers contributed 61% and 15.9% of our total revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 We sell our products in first-tier cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou. Our sales team sells our products directly to supermarket chains, mass merchandisers, large wholesalers, restaurants and others in these markets. In second-tier and third-tier cities, we currently sell our products to third-party distributors, such as food companies or trading companies with established distribution channels in such regions, rather than through our own sales team. The terms of a typical sales contract between us and our distributors provide that we are responsible for transportation costs and the distributors are responsible for storage costs. Furthermore, the distributors have the right to return products that fail to satisfy specified quality standards, at our cost. The majority of such contracts require the distributors to pay us in cash in full upon delivery, and the remaining contracts provide for short-term credit, usually two to three weeks. 
Our Sales and Marketing Efforts
 We have not spent a significant amount of capital on advertising in the past, and our advertising budget continues to be limited. In 2018, our marketing and branding efforts mainly focus on internet advertising.

 Competition and Market Position
 The overall food market is diverse, both globally and in China. We do not have a significant market share in China. 
 Our spice, sauce and beverage products compete with both large agribusiness companies and natural and organic packaged foods companies. Many of these competitors have significantly greater resources. Large agribusiness companies include Guangzhou Baihua Spice Corp. and natural and organic packaged foods companies include Shanghai House Food Corp. and Ankee Food Corporation. Given limited retailer shelf space and merchandising events, competitors actively support their respective brands with marketing, advertising and promotional spending. In addition, most retailers market similar items under their own private label, which compete for the same shelf space. 
 Competitive factors in our industry include product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, product variety and ingredients, product packaging and package design, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, and our ability to identify and satisfy consumer tastes and preferences.
 Intellectual Property
We take reasonable steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, such as limiting disclosure of proprietary plans, methods and other similar information on a need-to-know basis and requiring employees with access to our proprietary technology to enter into confidentiality arrangements. We believe that our proprietary technology and trade secrets are adequately protected.
Our Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 160 employees. Approximately 70 of our full-time employees are directly employed by our subsidiaries and VIEs and the remaining employees are employed by outsourcing agents that we use to meet our staffing needs. Compared to 2017, the total employees decreased by 85% due to bad operating performance and recent company restructure.
 The following table sets forth the allocation of employees, both direct and leased, by job function.
 
 | Number of
-------------------------+----------
Department | Employees
Production | 119 
Human Resources | 2 
Research and Development | 2 
Sales | 19 
Finance | 3 
Procurement | 3 
Administration | 12 
Total | 160 

 We have not experienced any significant problems or disruption to our operations due to labor disputes, nor have we experienced any difficulties in recruitment and retention of experienced staff. 
 We compensate our production line employees by unit produced (piece work) and compensate other employees with a base salary and bonus based on performance. We also provide training for our staffs from time to time to enhance their technical and product knowledge, including knowledge of industry quality standards.
 Our employees participate in state pension scheme and various types of social insurance organized by municipal and provincial governments. Outsourcing agents are responsible for contributions on behalf of the leased employees.

 Our Research and Development Activities
 We have research and development staffs at each of our facilities. In total, 2 employees are dedicated to research and development.
 We rely heavily on customer feedback to assist us in the modification and development of our products. We also utilize customer feedback to assist us in the development of new products.
 The amount we spent on research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was not a material portion of our total expenses for those years.
 Government Regulation
 As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to regulations of China's Agricultural Ministry and Ministry of Health. This regulatory scheme governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food. It also regulates manufacturing practices, including quality assurance programs, for foods through its current manufacturing practice regulations, and specifies the standards of identity for certain foods.
 We have obtained approvals from Chinese authorities for products that requires the approval under regulations, including quality safety approval from government.
