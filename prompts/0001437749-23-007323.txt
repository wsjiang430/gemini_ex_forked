The Company reports operations for two business segments: (1) Commercial Air Handling Equipment and (2) Industrial and Transportation Products. The identification of our operating segments is based on guidance in ASC 280 “Segment Reporting”. The Company's management evaluates segment performance based primarily on operating income. Interest expense directly related to financing the acquisition of a business is allocated to that respective segment. Intangible assets are allocated to each segment and the related amortization of these assets are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Beginning in 2022, the Company ceased allocating corporate costs to the respective segments.
 
Both the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment and the Industrial and Transportation Products segment engage in business activities from which they may recognize revenues and incur expenses, including revenue and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the Company. The operating results for both the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment and the Industrial and Transportation Products segment are reviewed regularly by our chief operating decision maker and is considered in making decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment in assessing its performance. Financial information for both segments is available in internal financial statements that are prepared on a monthly basis.

MPI specializes in rubber and plastic marine hose for the recreational boating industry. MPI offers certified products that meet marine industry standards and regulations. Effective April 19, 2019, the Company, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Data Genomix, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“DG”).

Separ America develops, designs, manufactures, sells and distributes oil change systems, fuel and oil transfer pumps, fuel primers, fuel polishing systems and engine flushing systems.

Knitting Machinery specializes in manufacturing hose reinforcement machinery for the plastic, rubber and silicone industries.
 
The factors used to determine the Company’s reportable segments follow the guidance of ASC 280-10-50-21 and 50-10-22 and include consideration of the type of products or services delivered, the customers and end markets served, the appliable revenue recognition methodology and the length of time it takes to deliver products or services to customers. The Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment was identified as a reportable segment consisting of Air Enterprises, because Air Enterprises is strategically and operationally different from our other companies in several ways. First, Air Enterprises sells equipment to end customers and our other businesses that fall into the Industrial and Transportation Products segment sell products and components to end customers, not equipment. Second, the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment delivers custom air handling solutions to customers which is different than the Industrial and Transportation Products segment which delivers manufactured metal, silicone, hydraulic and marine hoses, complex engineered components, highly engineered forgings, highly engineered and machined parts and data analytic technology applications. Third, the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment serves customers primarily in the health care and education end markets while the Industrial and Transportation Products segment delivers products to customers in the heavy-duty truck manufacturing, agricultural, industrial, petrochemical, aerospace, defense, industrial gas turbine, medical prosthetics, alternative energy and emergency vehicle end markets. Fourth, the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment recognizes revenue primarily over time while the Industrial and Transportation Products segment recognizes revenue primarily at a point in time. Fifth, the Commercial Air Handling Equipment segment manufactures custom air handling solutions for customers over a period of three to eighteen months from the time the order is received to the time the air handling solution is delivered to the end customer as compared to the Industrial and Transportation Products segment which sells and delivers products to customers much more quickly, often within 30 days or less. For the reasons previously mentioned, Air Enterprises is strategically and operationally different than the other businesses owned by the Company and management finds it useful to include this business in the Commercial Air Handling Segment which is separate and distinct from all of our other businesses that reside in the Industrial and Transportation Products segment.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Raw materials essential to the business segments are acquired from a large number of domestic manufacturers and some materials are purchased from European and Southeast Asian sources.

The Industrial and Transportation products segment uses various materials in the manufacture of its products. These include forgings and castings, steel fittings and hose packing consisting of silicone, cotton and copper wire. Seven suppliers provide approximately 55% of inventory purchases in this segment. If any one of these sources of supply were interrupted for any reason, the Company would need to devote additional time and expense in obtaining the same volume of supply from its other qualified sources.
 
Aluminum, the major raw material used in construction of the Commercial Air Handling units, is sourced from two major suppliers but is generally readily available from other sources. Copper is used by suppliers of a major component used in the product and the Company maintains relationships with three suppliers of these components to limit vulnerability. The Company maintains relationships with multiple suppliers for most of the other componentry used in assembly of the product, in order to maintain best costs for material and competitive lead times. The majority of materials for this segment are sourced domestically or from Canada.
 
The Company believes it has adequate sources of supply for its primary raw materials and components and has not had difficulty in obtaining the raw materials, component parts or finished goods from its suppliers.
 
Importance of Patents, Licenses, Franchises, Trademarks and Concessions
The Company’s Data Genomix LLC subsidiary holds a patent on technology used to facilitate highly targeted advertising to identified audience members across social media channels. Other than the names “Federal Hose”, “Marine Products International” and “CAD Enterprises”, “Global-Tek”, “Komtek Forge”, “Reverso Pumps”, and “Air Enterprises” and the FactoryBilt® and SiteBilt® registered trademarks, the Company does not have any material licenses, franchises or concessions.
Seasonality
In light of the markets served by its products, the Company does not believe that its Commercial Air Handling segment nor its Industrial and Transportation Products segment businesses are seasonal in nature.
