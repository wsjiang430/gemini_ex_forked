ITEM 1.               BUSINESS
Introduction
 
CM Seven Star Acquisition Corporation is a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated on November 28, 2016 as a blank check company for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more target businesses. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic location.
 
On October 30, 2017, we consummated our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 18,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (the “Ordinary Shares”), one-half of a redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”) and one right to receive 1/10 of an Ordinary Share upon the consummation of our initial business combination (the “Rights”). The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $180,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 2,700,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any.
 
On October 30, 2017, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with our Sponsor of 475,000 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $4,750,000. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO, except that the warrants underlying the Private Units (i) may be exercised on a cashless basis at the holder’s option and (ii) will not be redeemable by the Company, in each case as long as they are held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees. Additionally, because the Private Units were issued in a private transaction, our Sponsor and its permitted transferees will be allowed to exercise the warrants included in the Private Units for cash even if a registration statement covering the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants is not effective and receive unregistered Ordinary Shares. Additionally, our Sponsor agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the registration statement relating to the IPO) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. The Sponsor was granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the Private Units.
 
The underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part and, on November 3, 2017, the underwriters purchased 2,636,293 over-allotment option Units, which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $26,362,930. On November 3, 2017, simultaneously with the sale of the over-allotment Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 52,726 Private Units to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $527,260. On November 3, 2017, the underwriters canceled the remainder of the over-allotment option. In connection with the cancellation of the remainder of the over-allotment option, the Company canceled an aggregate of 15,927 Ordinary Shares issued to our Sponsor prior to the IPO and Private Placement.
 
A total of $206,362,930 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the over-allotment option Units) and the private placements on October 30, 2017 and November 3, 2017 were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders at JPMorgan Chase Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination and (ii) the Company’s failure to consummate a business combination by April 30, 2019. 
 
Business Combination Agreement
 
On November 2, 2018, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement” or the “Agreement”) with Renren Inc. (“Renren” or the “Seller”) and Kaixin Auto Group (“Kaixin”) pursuant to which we would acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Kaixin (the “Acquisition”).
 
3


Upon the closing of the transactions contemplated in the Share Exchange Agreement, we will acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding securities of Kaixin, in exchange for approximately 28.3 million of our ordinary shares. An additional 4.7 million shares million shares of CM Seven Star will be issued at closing or reserved for issuance under an equity incentive plan to members of Kaixin’s management team in exchange for currently outstanding options in Kaixin. Additionally, 19.5 million earnout shares are to be issued and held in escrow. The Seller may be entitled to receive earnout shares as follows: (1) if the Company’s gross revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 is greater than or equal to RMB 5,000,000,000, the Seller is entitled to receive 1,950,000 ordinary shares of CM Seven Star; (2) if the Company’s adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 is greater than or equal to RMB 150,000,000, the Seller is entitled to receive 3,900,000 ordinary shares of CM Seven Star, increasing proportionally to 7,800,000 ordinary shares if Company’s adjusted EBITDA is greater than or equal to RMB 200,000,000; and (3) if the Company’s adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 is greater than or equal to RMB 340,000,000, the Seller is entitled to receive 4,875,000 ordinary shares, increasing proportionally to 9,750,000 ordinary shares if the Company’s adjusted EBITDA is greater than or equal to RMB 480,000,000. Notwithstanding the Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA achieved by the post-transaction company for any period, Renren will receive the 2019 earnout shares if the stock price is higher than $13.00 for any sixty days in any period of ninety consecutive trading days during an fifteen month period following the closing, and will receive the 2019 earnout shares and the 2020 earnout shares if the stock price is higher than $13.50 for any sixty days in any period of ninety consecutive trading days during a thirty month period following the closing.
 
In connection with the Acquisition, we filed and will file relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including a proxy statement on Schedule 14A. Promptly after filing our definitive proxy statement with the SEC, we will mail the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the transaction. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF CM SEVEN STAR ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION THAT CM SEVEN STAR WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT CM SEVEN STAR, KAIXIN AND THE TRANSACTION. The preliminary proxy statement, the definitive proxy statement and other relevant materials in connection with the transaction (when they become available), and any other documents filed by us with the SEC, may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) or by writing to us at Suite 1306, 13/F, AIA Central, 1 Connaught Road, Central, Hong Kong.
 
Recent Developments
 
On January 24, 2019 we issued an unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of up to $1,100,000 to Shareholder Value Fund, the Company’s initial public offering sponsor (“SVF”). $1,100,000 has been fully drawn down on January 24, 2019. The note does not bear interest and matures upon closing of a business combination. In the event that the company does not close a business combination, the note will not be repaid.
 
On January 24, 2019 our Sponsor and Kaixin extended the time available to us to complete a business combination to April 30, 2019 by depositing $2,063,629.30 into our trust account. In conjunction with the extension, we issued unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,063,629.30 to SVF and Kaixin in exchange for those entities depositing such amount into the Company’s trust account. The notes do not bear interest and mature upon closing of a business combination by us. In addition, the notes may be converted by the holder into our units (identical to the units issued in our initial public offering) at a price of $10.00 per unit.
 
Competitive strengths
 
We believe our specific competitive strengths to be the following:
 
Status as a public company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our ordinary shares or for a combination of our ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests than it would have as a privately-held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
4


While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our requirements to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination and provide holders of public shares the opportunity to convert their shares into cash from the trust account, as a deterrent, and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company.
 
Transaction flexibility
 
We offer a target business a variety of options, such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing cash for stock, and providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.
 
Management Experience and Sponsor’s Relationship with CMIG
 
We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive risk-adjusted returns in the marketplace and that our contacts and transaction sources, ranging from industry executives, private owners, private equity funds, and investment bankers, in addition to the geographical reach of our affiliates, will enable us to pursue a broad range of opportunities. Our management team has significant experience in engaging in cross-border business in Asia, Europe, and the U.S., and understands the cultural, business and economic differences and opportunities that will allow us to negotiate a transaction. In addition, since our Sponsor is managed by an investment manager that is an affiliate of China Minsheng Investment Group Co. Ltd. (“CMIG”), a well-recognized financial company in China with sizeable investments in various industries, we believe that we could benefit from CMIG’s resources, including CMIG and its affiliates presenting to us potential targets, as well as CMIG’s assistance in analyzing and completing due diligence on such targets if needed.
 
Competitive Weaknesses
 
We believe our competitive weaknesses to be the following:
 
Limited Financial Resources
 
Our financial reserves will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of venture capital firms, leveraged buyout firms and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. In addition, our financial resources could be reduced because of our obligation to convert shares held by our public shareholders as well as any tender offer we conduct.
 
Lack of experience with blank check companies
 
Our management team is not experienced in pursuing business combinations on behalf of blank check companies. Other blank check companies may be sponsored and managed by individuals with prior experience in completing business combinations between blank check companies and target businesses. Our managements’ lack of experience may not be viewed favorably by target businesses.
 
5


Limited technical and human resources
 
As a blank check company, we have limited technical and human resources. Many venture capital funds, leveraged buyout firms and operating businesses possess greater technical and human resources than we do and thus we may be at a disadvantage when competing with them for target businesses.
 
Delay associated with shareholder approval or tender offer
 
We may be required to seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination. If we are not required to obtain shareholder approval of an initial business combination, we will allow our shareholders to sell their shares to us pursuant to a tender offer. Both seeking shareholder approval and conducting a tender offer will delay the consummation of our initial business combination. Other companies competing with us for acquisition opportunities may not be subject to similar requirement, or may be able to satisfy such requirements more quickly than we can. As a result, we may be at a disadvantage in competing for these opportunities.
 
Effecting an Acquisition Transaction
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business until the closing of a business combination. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placements, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting our initial business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placements are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business combination, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. Accordingly, investors in the IPO were investing without first having an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any one or more business combinations.
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the funds in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriter’s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account), which we refer to as the 80% test, at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may structure a business combination with one or more target businesses whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. We believe that Kaixin satisfies this test.
Shareholder Approval of Business Combination
 
In connection with the proposed business combination with Kaixin, we are seeking shareholder approval of the Acquisition. At the meeting called for such purpose, public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable). Our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act.
 
6


Our initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if only a quorum is present at the meeting at which we seek shareholder approval of the proposed Acquisition, we would need only 893,974 of our public shares (or approximately 4.3% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved.
 
None of our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase Units or Ordinary Shares from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial shareholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of Ordinary Shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
 
Conversion/Tender Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The conversion rights will be effected under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and Cayman Islands law as redemptions. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares.
 
Our initial shareholders, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to the IPO, in the IPO or in the aftermarket.
 
We may also require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. Once the shares are converted by the holder, and effectively redeemed by us under Cayman Islands law, the transfer agent will then update our Register of Members to reflect all conversions. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to shareholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any shareholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a shareholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public shareholders who wish to convert their ordinary shares into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.
 
7


Any request to convert or tender such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
Automatic Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
If we do not complete a business combination by April 30, 2019, it will trigger our automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. As a result, this has the same effect as if we had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Companies Law. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not necessary to pay our taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the public rights will expire and will be worthless.
 
The amount in the trust account (less approximately $1,800 representing the aggregate nominal par value of the shares of our public shareholders) under the Companies Law will be treated as share premium which is distributable under the Companies Law provided that immediately following the date on which the proposed distribution is proposed to be made, we are able to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If we are forced to liquidate the trust account, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore, while we will seek to have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engaged to assist us in any way in connection with our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable.
 
Each of our initial shareholders and our Sponsor has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of our trust account or other assets with respect to the insider shares and private units and to vote their insider shares and private shares in favor of any dissolution and plan of distribution which we submit to a vote of shareholders. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants or rights, which will expire worthless.
 
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share distribution from the trust account would be $10.00.
 
8


The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would be prior to the claims of our public shareholders. Although we will seek to have all vendors, including lenders for money borrowed, prospective target businesses or other entities we engage execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, we would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to us if we chose not to engage such third party and evaluate if such engagement would be in the best interest of our shareholders if such third party refused to waive such claims. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event, our management would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and would only enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver if management believed that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.
 
Bing Lin, our former Chief Executive Officer and member of our Board of Directors, agreed that, if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination, he will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us in excess of the net proceeds of the IPO not held in the trust account, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such debts or obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only if such parties have not executed a waiver agreement. However, we cannot assure you that he will be able to satisfy those obligations if he is required to do so. Accordingly, the actual per-share distribution could be less than $10.00 due to claims of creditors. Additionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public shareholders at least $10.00 per share.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

• | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NASDAQ may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our outstanding warrants, rights and unit purchase options and the potential future dilution they represent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
9



• | our obligation to pay EarlyBirdCapital a fee of 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the IPO upon consummation of our initial business combination pursuant to the business combination marketing agreement (as described in the prospectus relating to the IPO);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our obligation to either repay or issue units upon conversion of up to $500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms. Furthermore, the fact that we will not be required to pay our underwriters any deferred compensation upon consummation of an initial business combination may give us a competitive advantage over other similarly structured blank check companies.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Employees
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
