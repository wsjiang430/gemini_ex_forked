Item 1. Business
We were incorporated in February 2007 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Universal Compression Holdings, Inc. In August 2007, Universal Compression Holdings, Inc. and Hanover Compressor Company merged into our wholly-owned subsidiaries and we became the parent entity of Universal Compression Holdings, Inc. and Hanover Compressor Company, named “Exterran Holdings, Inc.” In November 2015, we completed the Spin-off of our international contract operations, international aftermarket services and global fabrication businesses into a standalone public company operating as Exterran Corporation and we were renamed “Archrock, Inc.” Following the completion of the Spin-off, we and Exterran Corporation are independent, publicly-traded companies with separate public ownership, boards of directors and management and we continue to own and operate the U.S. contract operations and U.S. aftermarket services businesses that we previously owned. Results of operations for Exterran Corporation have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this 2018 Form 10-K (see Note 4 (“Discontinued Operations”) to our Financial Statements).
We are an energy infrastructure company with a pure-play focus on midstream natural gas compression. We are the leading provider of natural gas compression services to customers in the oil and natural gas industry throughout the U.S. and a leading supplier of aftermarket services to customers that own compression equipment in the U.S. Our business supports a must-run service that is essential to the production, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas. Our geographic diversity, technically experienced personnel and large fleet of natural gas compression equipment enable us to provide reliable contract operations services to our customers throughout the U.S.
Our revenues and income are derived from two primary business segments:

• | Contract Operations. Our contract operations business is comprised of our owned fleet of natural gas compression equipment that we use to provide operations services to our customers.


• | Aftermarket Services. Our aftermarket services business provides a full range of services to support the compression needs of customers. We sell parts and components and provide operations, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services to customers who own compression equipment.

Recent Business Developments
Merger Transaction
Prior to the Merger, we owned a 43% equity interest in the Partnership, a limited partnership that provides natural gas contract operations services to customers throughout the U.S. On April 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common units of the Partnership that we did not already own and, as a result, the Partnership became our wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with the closing of the Merger, we issued 57.6 million shares of our common stock to acquire the 41.2 million common units of the Partnership not owned by us prior to the Merger at a fixed exchange ratio of 1.40 shares of our common stock for each Partnership common unit, for total implied consideration of $625.3 million. Additionally, the incentive distribution rights in the Partnership, which were owned by us prior to the Merger, were canceled and ceased to exist. As a result of the Merger, common units of the Partnership are no longer publicly traded. We consolidated the results of operations of the Partnership prior to the Merger and continue to consolidate its results subsequent to the Merger. See Note 20 (“Equity”) to our Financial Statements for further details of the Merger.
Amendment to the Partnership Credit Facility and Termination of the Archrock Credit Facility
On April 26, 2018, in connection with the closing of the Merger, the aggregate revolving commitment under the Partnership Credit Facility increased from $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion pursuant to Amendment No. 1 and we terminated the Archrock Credit Facility and all commitments thereunder. See Part II “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Financial Resources” below and Note 11 (“Long-Term Debt”) to the Financial Statements for further details of Amendment No. 1 and the termination of the Archrock Credit Facility.

Contract Operations Services Overview
We provide comprehensive contract operations services including the personnel, equipment, tools, materials and supplies to meet our customers’ natural gas compression needs. Based on the operating specifications at the customer location and each customer’s unique needs, these services include designing, sourcing, owning, installing, operating, servicing, repairing and maintaining equipment. When providing contract operations services, we work closely with a customer’s field service personnel so that the compression services can be adjusted to efficiently match changing characteristics of the natural gas reservoir and the natural gas produced. We routinely repackage or reconfigure a portion of our existing fleet to adapt to our customers’ compression needs. We primarily utilize reciprocating compressors driven by internal natural gas-fired combustion engines.
Our equipment is maintained in accordance with established maintenance schedules, standards and procedures. These maintenance procedures are updated as technology changes and as our operations group develops new techniques and procedures to better service our equipment. In addition, because our field technicians provide maintenance on our contract operations equipment, they are familiar with the condition of our equipment and can readily identify potential problems. In our experience, these maintenance procedures maximize equipment life and unit availability, minimize avoidable downtime and lower the overall maintenance expenditures over the equipment life. Generally, each of our compressor units undergoes a major overhaul once every four to eight years, depending on the type, size and utilization of the unit.
Our customers typically contract for our services on a site-by-site basis for a specific monthly service rate that is generally reduced if we fail to operate in accordance with the contract requirements. Following the initial minimum term, which ranges from 12 to 60 months, contract operations services generally continue on a month-to-month basis until terminated by either party with 30 days’ advance notice. Our customers generally are required to pay our monthly service fee even during periods of limited or disrupted natural gas flows, which enhances the stability and predictability of our cash flows. Additionally, because we typically do not take title to the natural gas we compress and the natural gas we use as fuel for our compressors and other equipment is supplied by our customers, we have limited direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations. See “General Terms of our Contract Operations Customer Service Agreements” below for a more detailed description.
We maintain field service locations from which we can service and overhaul our compressor fleet to provide contract operations services to our customers. We also use many of these locations to provide aftermarket services to our customers, as described below. As of December 31, 2018, our contract operations segment provided contract operations services primarily using a fleet of 6,891 natural gas compression units with an aggregate capacity of 4.0 million horsepower. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 74% of our total revenue and 91% of our total gross margin was generated from contract operations. Gross margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, is reconciled, in total, to net income (loss), its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in Part II, Item 7 (“Non-GAAP Financial Measures”) of this 2018 Form 10-K.
Compressor Fleet
The following table summarizes the size and horsepower of our natural gas compressor fleet as of December 31, 2018:

 | Number of Units | AggregateHorsepower(in thousands) | | % ofHorsepower
0 — 1,000 horsepower per unit | 5,051 | | 1,194 | | 30 | %
1,001 — 1,500 horsepower per unit | 1,364 | | 1,831 | | 46 | %
Over 1,500 horsepower per unit | 476 | | 938 | | 24 | %
Total | 6,891 | | 3,963 | | 100 | %

We continue efforts to standardize our compressor fleet around major components and key suppliers. The standardization of our fleet:

• | enables us to minimize our fleet operating costs and maintenance capital requirements;


• | enables us to reduce inventory costs;


• | facilitates low-cost compressor resizing; and


• | allows us to develop improved technical proficiency in our maintenance and overhaul operations, which enables us to achieve higher uptime while maintaining lower operating costs.

Aftermarket Services Overview
Our aftermarket services business sells parts and components and provides operations, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services to customers who own compression equipment. We believe that we are particularly well-qualified to provide these services because our highly experienced operating personnel have access to the full range of our compression services and facilities. In addition, we believe that our aftermarket services business provides opportunities to cross-sell our contract operations services. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 26% of our total revenue and 9% of our total gross margin was generated from aftermarket services.
Competitive Strengths
We believe we have the following key competitive strengths:

• | Large horsepower. We believe we have the largest fleet of large horsepower equipment among all outsourced compression service providers in the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, 71% of our fleet, as measured by operating horsepower, was comprised of units that exceed 1,000 horsepower per unit. We believe the trends driving demand for large horsepower units will continue. These trends include (i) high levels of associated gas production from shale wells which is generally produced at a lower initial pressure than dry gas wells, (ii) pad drilling which brings multiple wells to a single well site with larger volumes of gas, (iii) increasing well lateral lengths which increase natural gas flow through gas gathering systems and (iv) high probability drilling programs that allow for efficient infrastructure planning.


• | Superior customer service. We operate in a relationship-driven, service-intensive industry and therefore need to provide superior customer service. We believe that our regionally-based network, local presence, experience and in-depth knowledge of our customers’ operating needs and growth plans enable us to respond to our customers’ needs and meet their evolving demands on a timely basis. In addition, we focus on achieving a high level of reliability for the services we provide in order to maximize our customers’ production levels. Our sales efforts concentrate on demonstrating our commitment to enhancing our customers’ cash flows through superior customer service and after-market support.


• | Large fleet in substantially all major U.S. producing regions. We operate in substantially all major oil and natural gas producing regions in the U.S. Our large fleet and numerous operating locations throughout the U.S., combined with our ability to efficiently move equipment among producing regions, mean that we are not dependent on production activity in any particular region. We believe our size, geographic scope and broad customer base provide us with improved operating expertise and business development opportunities.


• | Fee-based cash flows. We charge a fixed monthly fee for our contract operations services that our customers are generally required to pay regardless of the volume of natural gas we compress in any given month. Our compressors, on average, operate at a customer location for approximately three years. We believe this fee structure and the longevity of our operations reduces volatility and enhances the stability and predictability of our cash flows.


• | Large and stable customer base. We have strong relationships with a deep base of oil and gas producers and midstream companies. Our contract compression revenue base is sourced from approximately 550 customers operating throughout all major U.S. oil and natural gas producing regions.

10

Business Strategies
We intend to continue to capitalize on our competitive strengths to meet our customers’ needs through the following key strategies:

• | Capitalize on the long-term fundamentals for the U.S. natural gas compression industry. We believe our ability to efficiently meet our customers’ evolving compression needs, our long-standing customer relationships and our large compressor fleet will enable us to capitalize on what we believe are favorable long-term fundamentals for the U.S. natural gas compression industry. These fundamentals include significant natural gas resources in the U.S., increased unconventional oil and natural gas production, decreasing natural reservoir pressures, expected increased natural gas demand in the U.S. from growth of liquid natural gas exports, exports of natural gas via pipeline to Mexico, power generation and industrial uses.


• | Improve profitability. We are focused on increasing productivity and optimizing our processes. In the fourth quarter of 2018 we began a two-year process and technology transformation project that will, among other things, upgrade our existing ERP system, improve our supply chain and inventory management and expand the remote monitoring capabilities of our compression fleet. By using technology to make our systems and processes more efficient, we intend to lower our internal costs and improve our profitability over time. Additionally, as demand increases for our services and industry utilization rates improve for compression equipment, we believe we will have additional opportunities to improve pricing.


• | Grow our business to generate attractive returns. We plan to continue to invest in strategically growing our business both organically and through third-party acquisitions. Our contract operations business is our largest business segment and represents 91% of our gross margin during 2018. We see opportunities to grow this business over the long term by putting idle units back to work and adding new horsepower in key growth areas, including providing compression services to midstream companies and producers of oil and natural gas. In addition, because a large amount of compression equipment is owned by oil and gas producers, processors, gatherers, transporters and storage providers, we believe there will be additional opportunities for our aftermarket services business, which represented 9% of our gross margin during 2018, to provide services and parts to support the operation of this equipment.

Natural Gas Compression Industry Overview
Natural gas compression is a mechanical process whereby the pressure of a given volume of natural gas is increased to a desired higher pressure for transportation from one point to another. It is essential to the production and transportation of natural gas. Compression is typically required several times during the natural gas production and transportation cycle including (i) at the wellhead, (ii) throughout gathering and distribution systems, (iii) into and out of processing and storage facilities and (iv) along intrastate and interstate pipelines.

• | Wellhead and Gathering Systems — Natural gas compression is used to transport natural gas from the wellhead through the gathering system. At some point during the life of natural gas wells, reservoir pressures typically fall below the line pressure of the natural gas gathering or pipeline system used to transport the natural gas to market. At that point, natural gas no longer naturally flows into the pipeline. Compression equipment is applied in both field and gathering systems to boost the pressure levels of the natural gas flowing from the well, allowing it to be transported to market. Changes in pressure levels in natural gas fields require periodic changes to the size and/or type of on-site compression equipment. Additionally, compression is used to reinject natural gas into producing oil wells to maintain reservoir pressure and help lift liquids to the surface, which is known as secondary oil recovery or natural gas lift operations. These applications utilize low- to mid-range horsepower compression equipment located at or near the wellhead or large horsepower compression equipment for a centralized gas lift system servicing multiple wells. Compression equipment is also used to increase the efficiency of a low-capacity natural gas field by providing a central compression point from which the natural gas can be produced and injected into a pipeline for transmission to facilities for further processing.


• | Pipeline Transportation Systems — Natural gas compression is used during the transportation of natural gas from the gathering systems to storage or the end user. Natural gas transported through a pipeline loses pressure over the length of the pipeline. Compression is staged along the pipeline to increase capacity and boost pressure to overcome the friction and hydrostatic losses inherent in normal operations. These pipeline applications generally require larger horsepower compression equipment (1,500 horsepower and higher).


• | Storage Facilities — Natural gas compression is used in natural gas storage projects for injection and withdrawals during the normal operational cycles of these facilities.

11


• | Processing Applications — Compressors may also be used in combination with natural gas production and processing equipment to process natural gas into other marketable energy sources. In addition, compression services are used for compression applications in refineries and petrochemical plants.

Many oil and natural gas producers, transporters and processors outsource their compression services due to the benefits and flexibility of contract compression. Changing well and pipeline pressures and conditions over the life of a well often require producers to reconfigure or replace their compressor units to optimize the well production or gathering system efficiency.
We believe outsourcing compression operations to compression service providers such as us offers customers:

• | the ability to efficiently meet their changing compression needs over time while limiting the underutilization of their owned compression equipment;


• | access to the compression service provider’s specialized personnel and technical skills, including engineers and field service and maintenance employees, which we believe generally leads to improved production rates and/or increased throughput;


• | the ability to increase their profitability by transporting or producing a higher volume of oil and natural gas through decreased compression downtime and reduced operating, maintenance and equipment costs by allowing the compression service provider to efficiently manage their compression needs; and


• | the flexibility to deploy their capital on projects more directly related to their primary business by reducing their compression equipment and maintenance capital requirements.

We believe the U.S. natural gas compression services industry continues to have growth potential over time due to, among other things, increased natural gas production in the U.S. from unconventional sources and aging producing natural gas fields that will require more compression to continue producing the same volume of natural gas and expected increased demand for natural gas in the U.S. for power generation, industrial uses and exports including liquid natural gas exports and exports of natural gas via pipeline to Mexico.
Oil and Natural Gas Industry Cyclicality and Volatility
Changes in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending normally result in changes in demand for our products and services; however, we believe our contract operations business is typically less impacted by commodity prices because:

• | compression services are a necessary part of midstream energy infrastructure that facilitate the transportation of natural gas through gathering systems;


• | our contract operations business is tied primarily to oil and natural gas production, transportation and consumption, which are generally less cyclical in nature than exploration activities;


• | the need for compression services and equipment has grown over time due to the increased production of natural gas, the natural pressure decline of natural gas producing basins and the increased percentage of natural gas production from unconventional sources; and


• | our compressors operate at a customer location for an average of approximately three years during which time our customers are generally required to pay a fixed monthly fee regardless of the volume of natural gas we compress in any given month.

In addition, because we do not take title to the natural gas we compress and the natural gas we use as fuel for our compressors is supplied by our customers, our direct exposure to commodity price risk is further reduced.
Seasonal Fluctuations
Our results of operations have not historically reflected any material seasonal tendencies and we do not believe that seasonal fluctuations will have a material impact on us in the foreseeable future.
12

Market and Customers
We conduct our contract operations activities in substantially all major oil and natural gas producing areas throughout the U.S.
Our customer base consists primarily of companies engaged in all aspects of the oil and natural gas industry including large integrated oil and natural gas producers, processors, gatherers, transporters and storage providers.
We have entered into preferred vendor arrangements with some of our customers that give us preferential consideration for their compression needs. In exchange, we provide these customers with enhanced product availability, product support and favorable pricing.
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, Williams Partners accounted for 11%, 13% and 13% of our revenue, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenue during these years.
Sales and Marketing
Our marketing and client service functions are coordinated and performed by our sales and field service personnel. Sales and field service personnel regularly visit our customers to ensure customer satisfaction, determine customer needs as to services currently being provided and ascertain potential future compression services requirements. This ongoing communication allows us to quickly respond to customer requests.
General Terms of our Contract Operations Customer Service Agreements
We typically enter into a master service agreement with each customer that sets forth the general terms and conditions of our services, and then enter into a separate supplemental service agreement for each distinct site at which we will provide contract operations services. The following describes select material terms common to our standard contract operations service agreements.
Term and Termination. Our customers typically contract for our contract operations services on a site-by-site basis. Following the initial minimum term for our contract operations services, which ranges from 12 to 60 months, contract operations services generally continue until terminated by either party with 30 days’ advance notice.
Fees and Expenses. Our customers pay a fixed monthly fee for our contract operations services, which generally is based on expected natural gas volumes and pressures associated with a specific application. Our customers generally are required to pay our monthly fee even during periods of limited or disrupted natural gas flows. We are typically responsible for the costs and expenses associated with our compression equipment used to provide the contract operations services except for fuel gas, which is provided by our customers.
Service Standards and Specifications. We provide contract operations services according to the particular specifications of each job, as set forth in the applicable contract. These are typically turn-key service contracts under which we supply all services and support and use our compression equipment to provide the contract operations services necessary for a particular application. In certain circumstances, if the availability of our services does not meet certain percentages specified in our contracts, our customers are generally entitled, upon request, to specified credits against our service fees.
Title and Risk of Loss. We own and retain title to or have an exclusive possessory interest in all compression equipment used to provide contract operations services and we generally bear risk of loss for such equipment to the extent the loss is not caused by gas conditions, our customers’ acts or omissions or the failure or collapse of the customer’s over-water job site upon which we provide the contract operations services.
Insurance. Typically, both we and our customers are required to carry general liability, workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, automobile and excess liability insurance. Our insurance coverage includes property damage, general liability and commercial automobile liability and other coverage we believe is appropriate. Additionally, we are substantially self-insured for workers’ compensation and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks.
13

Suppliers
Prior to the Spin-off, we fabricated compression and production and processing equipment to provide contract operations services and to sell to third parties from components and subassemblies, most of which we acquired from a wide range of vendors. In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a supply agreement with Exterran Corporation under which we were required to purchase our requirements of newly-fabricated compression equipment from Exterran Corporation and its affiliates, subject to certain exceptions. This supply agreement expired in November 2017 and we have since entered into new supply agreements with multiple suppliers, including Exterran Corporation, to meet our compression equipment needs.
Competition
The natural gas compression services business is highly competitive. Overall, we experience considerable competition from companies that may be able to more quickly adapt to technological changes within our industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. We believe we are competitive with respect to price, equipment availability, customer service, flexibility in meeting customer needs, technical expertise and quality and reliability of our compressors and related services.
Increased size and geographic scope offer compression services providers operating and cost advantages. As the number of compression locations and size of the compression fleet increases, the number of required sales, administrative and maintenance personnel increases at a lesser rate, resulting in operational efficiencies and potential cost advantages. Additionally, broad geographic scope allows compression service providers to more efficiently provide services to all customers, particularly those with compression applications in remote locations. We believe our large fleet of compression equipment and broad geographic base of operations and related operational personnel give us more flexibility in meeting our customers’ needs than many of our competitors.
Environmental and Other Regulations
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment and to occupational safety and health. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and safety and health laws and regulations and that continued compliance with currently applicable requirements would not have a material adverse effect on us. However, the trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in these laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, emission or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
The primary U.S. federal environmental laws to which our operations are subject include the CAA and regulations thereunder, which regulate air emissions; the CWA and regulations thereunder, which regulate the discharge of pollutants in industrial wastewater and storm water runoff; the RCRA and regulations thereunder, which regulate the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes; and the CERCLA and regulations thereunder, known more commonly as “Superfund,” which impose liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances in the environment. We are also subject to regulation under the OSHA and regulations thereunder, which regulate the protection of the safety and health of workers. Analogous state and local laws and regulations may also apply.
Air Emissions
The CAA and analogous state laws and their implementing regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various sources, including natural gas compressors, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require a facility to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations, or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Our standard contract operations agreement typically provides that the customer will assume permitting responsibilities and certain environmental risks related to site operations.

New Source Performance Standards
On June 3, 2016, the EPA issued final regulations amending the NSPS for the oil and natural gas source category and applying to sources of emissions of methane and VOC from certain processes, activities and equipment that is constructed, modified or reconstructed after September 18, 2015. Specifically, the regulation contains both methane and VOC standards for several emission sources not previously covered by the NSPS, such as fugitive emissions from compressor stations and pneumatic pumps and methane standards for certain emission sources that are already regulated for VOC, such as equipment leaks at natural gas processing plants. The amendments also establish methane standards for a subset of equipment that the current NSPS regulates, including reciprocating compressors and pneumatic controllers, and extend the current VOC standards to the remaining unregulated equipment. In June 2017, the EPA proposed and took public comment on a two-year stay of the fugitive emissions requirements, well site pneumatic standards and closed vent certification. The EPA sought additional comment in November 2017 in support of the proposed rule, but has not finalized the two-year stay. In October 2018, the EPA proposed targeted deregulatory amendments to the 2016 rule intended to streamline implementation, reduce duplicative EPA and state requirements and decrease the burden of compliance. The EPA has not yet issued a final rule, but anticipates doing so in the second quarter of 2019. It is also anticipated that the EPA will attempt to make additional deregulatory changes to the NSPS going forward. The EPA has announced that it is reviewing the rule more broadly to propose amendments to address key policy issues, such as the regulation of methane, in this sector. The EPA has not announced the timing of this rule. At this time, we do not believe the rule will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Venting and Flaring on Federal Lands
On November 18, 2016, the BLM published final rules to reduce venting and flaring on federal and tribal lands. The rules set forth some novel requirements regarding leak detection inspections at compressor stations and imposed requirements to reduce emissions from pneumatic controllers and pumps, among other things. In September 2018, the BLM finalized a rule rescinding the novel requirements pertaining to waste-minimization plans, gas-capture percentages, well drilling, well completion and related operations, pneumatic controllers, pneumatic diaphragm pumps, storage vessels and leak detection and repair. The BLM also revised other provisions related to venting and flaring.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards
On October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a new NAAQS ozone standard of 70 ppb, which is a reduction from the 75 ppb standard set in 2008. This new standard became effective on December 28, 2015, and the EPA completed designating attainment/non-attainment regions under the revised ozone standard in 2018. In November 2016, the EPA proposed an implementation rule for the 2015 NAAQS ozone standard, but the agency has yet to issue a final implementation rule. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our customers’ ability to obtain such permits and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. By law, the EPA must review each NAAQS every five years. In June 2018, the EPA announced that it has begun the process of reviewing the 2015 NAAQS ozone standard for the purposes of revising the standard. The agency has stated that it intends to keep the 70 ppb standard, but it has launched a fast-track review of the standard under new internal guidelines. The EPA has asked for information related to adverse effects that may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of NAAQS and is considering re-evaluating the extent to which the EPA can or should consider levels of background ozone when choosing a standard. The EPA expects to conclude the review by October 2020 as required by law. At this time, however, we cannot predict whether state implementation of the 2015 NAAQS ozone standard or the 2020 NAAQS ozone standard would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
In January 2011, the TCEQ finalized revisions to certain air permit programs that significantly increase air emissions-related requirements for new and certain existing oil and gas production and gathering sites in the Barnett Shale production area. The final rule established new emissions standards for engines, which could impact the operation of specific categories of engines by requiring the use of alternative engines, compressor packages or the installation of aftermarket emissions control equipment. The rule became effective for the Barnett Shale production area in April 2011, and the lower emissions standards will become applicable between 2020 and 2030 depending on the type of engine and the permitting requirements. A number of other states where our engines are operated have adopted or are considering adopting additional regulations that could impose new air permitting or pollution control requirements for engines, some of which could entail material costs to comply. At this time, however, we cannot predict whether any such rules would require us to incur material costs.
15

General
These new regulations and proposals, when finalized, and any other new regulations requiring the installation of more sophisticated pollution control equipment or the adoption of other environmental protection measures, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Climate Change Legislation and Regulatory Initiatives
The U.S. Congress has previously considered legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive federal climate legislation will become law in the near future, although energy legislation and other initiatives continue to be proposed that may be relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. Almost half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that smaller sources such as our gas-fired compressors could become subject to greenhouse gas-related regulation. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations.
Independent of Congress, the EPA has promulgated regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions under its existing CAA authority. The EPA has adopted rules requiring many facilities, including petroleum and natural gas systems, to inventory and report their greenhouse gas emissions. These reporting obligations were triggered for some sites we operated in 2018.
In addition, the EPA rules provide air permitting requirements for certain large sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The requirement for large sources of greenhouse gas emissions to obtain and comply with permits will affect some of our and our customers’ largest new or modified facilities going forward, but is not expected to cause us to incur material costs.
At the international level, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France, which resulted in the Paris Agreement that requires member countries to review and ‘‘represent a progression’’ in their intended nationally determined contributions and set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. Although this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their greenhouse gas emissions, it does include pledges from the participating nations to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. In June 2017, President Trump stated that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but may enter into a future international agreement related to greenhouse gases on different terms. The Paris Agreement provides an exit process, which dictates that the United States cannot formally announce its plan to withdraw until November 2019, which would then be followed by a one-year waiting period, resulting in an effective exit date of no earlier than November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process is uncertain and the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.
Although it is not currently possible to predict how any proposed or future greenhouse gas legislation or regulation promulgated by Congress, the states or multi-state regions will impact our business, any regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Water Discharges
The CWA and analogous state laws and their implementing regulations impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the U.S. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. In addition, the CWA regulates storm water discharges associated with industrial activities depending on a facility’s primary standard industrial classification. Several of our facilities have applied for and obtained industrial wastewater discharge permits as well as sought coverage under local wastewater ordinances. U.S. federal laws also require development and implementation of spill prevention, controls and countermeasure plans, including appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak at such facilities.
16

Waste Management and Disposal
RCRA and analogous state laws and their implementing regulations govern the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. During the course of our operations, we generate wastes (including, but not limited to, used oil, antifreeze, filters, sludges, paints, solvents and abrasive blasting materials) in quantities regulated under RCRA. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for these types of wastes. CERCLA and analogous state laws and their implementing regulations impose strict, and under certain conditions, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and past owners and operators of the facility or disposal site where the release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.
We currently own or lease, and in the past have owned or leased, a number of properties that have been used in support of our operations for a number of years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons, hazardous substances, or other regulated wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such materials have been taken for disposal by companies sub-contracted by us. In addition, many of these properties have been previously owned or operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or other regulated wastes was not under our control. These properties and the materials released or disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate historical property contamination, or to perform certain operations to prevent future contamination. At certain of such sites, we are currently working with the prior owners who have undertaken to monitor and clean up contamination that occurred prior to our acquisition of these sites. We are not currently under any order requiring that we undertake or pay for any cleanup activities. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not receive any such order in the future.
Occupational Safety and Health
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the safety and health of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,700 employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
