The global disaster recovery solutions market has been experiencing a significant increase in demand owing to growing instances related to infrastructure failure, cyberattacks, natural disasters, and other internal and external threats. Unanticipated events such as these cause disruption in business operations, resulting in massive losses for organizations.
 
Various companies are reconsidering their plans for backup and recovery of important business applications and data over the past few years owing to increasing occurrences of planned, manmade disasters. For instance, malicious attacks such as WannaCry and Locky ransomware in 2017 led to the loss of thousands of encrypted files and systems. Government and private sectors incurred considerable financial losses owing to these attacks.

Moreover, increasing awareness about the benefits of implementing such solutions and growing adoption of cloud-based solutions are promoting the adoption of disaster recovery solutions among SMEs.
The global infrastructure as a service (IaaS) industry value is expected to exceed US$ 60 billion by 2024 with an estimated growth rate of over 25% over the forecast period. IaaS is a form of cloud computing system dependent on significant physical resources, such as network connections, bandwidth, load balancers, and servers, which are present as a virtual service offered by the cloud service providers (CSPs). An increasing amount of financial and business information and other critical data in various IT sectors are expected to increase the adoption of IaaS in many organizations.
 The need for reducing cost in IT infrastructure management, and to focus more on their primary operations has been the key objective of various companies and agencies. The technological innovations have led to growing mobility, ease of access, sophisticated working environment, and digitalization development in numerous business verticals. Ease of deployment, flexibility, and scalability of services can also be acknowledged as the key factors steering the market growth.
 The IT and telecommunications sector are expected to witness significant growth rate owing to increasing adoption of cloud-based services in the industry. This industry is considered to be the primary vertical generating enormous personal, financial and healthcare information. Customer-based organizations in banking financial services and in the insurance (BFSI) sector create large volumes of confidential business and financial data which look at security and storage convenience for smooth business continuity.
 
More and more companies are adopting the system of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), hence, the demand for VoIP services is also growing. Moreover, along with updating their services, VoIP service providers are also introducing new features in VoIP services to attract users at both individual and corporate level. New market avenues are likely to open with an increase in international calling.
