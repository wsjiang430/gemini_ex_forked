Item 1. Business

Weatherford International plc, an Irish public limited company and Swiss tax resident, was formed on June 17, 2014, after a change in our place of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland, together with its subsidiaries (“Weatherford,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”), and is a multinational oilfield service company. Weatherford is one of the world’s leading providers of equipment and services used in the drilling, evaluation, completion, production and intervention of oil and natural gas wells. Many of our businesses, including those of our predecessor companies, have been operating for more than 50 years.

We conduct operations in over 80 countries and have service and sales locations in virtually all of the oil and natural gas producing regions in the world. Our operational performance is reviewed on a geographic basis and we report our Western Hemisphere and Eastern Hemisphere as separate and distinct reporting segments.
Our headquarters are located at Weststrasse 1, 6340 Baar, Switzerland and our telephone number at that location is +41.22.816.1500. Our internet address is www.weatherford.com. General information about us, including our corporate governance policies, code of business conduct and charters for the committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the “Investor Relations” section. On our website we make available, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish them to the SEC. The SEC maintains a website that contains our reports, proxy and information statements, and our other SEC filings. The address of that site is www.sec.gov. Our ordinary shares are listed on the NYSE under the symbol “WFT.” 
 Strategy

Our primary objective is to build stakeholder value through profitable growth in our core product lines with disciplined use of capital and a strong customer focus.

Principal components of our strategy include the following:

• | Continuously improving the efficiency, productivity and quality of our products and services and their respective delivery to our customers, in order to grow revenues and operating margins from our principal business operations (Production, Completions, Drilling and Evaluation and Well Construction) in all of our geographic markets at a rate exceeding the underlying market;


• | A commitment to the innovation, invention and integration, development and commercialization of new products and service that meet the evolving needs of our customers across the reservoir lifecycle; and


• | Further extending the process, productivity, service quality, safety and competency across our global infrastructure to meet client demands for our core products and services in an operationally efficient manner.

Markets

We are a leading provider of equipment and services to the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. Demand for our industry’s services and products depends upon commodity prices for oil and gas, the number of oil and natural gas wells drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of wells, the number of well completions, the depletion and age of existing wells and the level of workover activity worldwide.
Technology is critical to the oil and natural gas marketplace as a result of the maturity of the world’s oil and natural gas reservoirs, the acceleration of production decline rates and the focus on complex well designs, including deepwater prospects. Clients continue to seek, test and use production-enabling technologies at an increasing rate. We have invested a substantial amount of our time and resources into building our technology offerings, which helps us to provide our clients with more efficient tools to find and produce oil and natural gas. We believe our products and services enable our clients to reduce their costs of drilling and production, increase production rates, or both. Furthermore, these offerings afford us additional opportunities to sell our core products and services to our clients.

Divestitures
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of a portion of the land drilling rigs operations we previously committed to divesting in the fourth quarter of 2017, and received gross cash proceeds of $216 million. The sale represents two of a series of four closings pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements entered into with ADES International Holding Ltd. (“ADES”) in July of 2018 to sell our land drilling rig operations in Algeria, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, as well as two idle land rigs in Iraq. The sale is for 31 land rigs and related drilling contracts, as well as the transfer of employees and contract personnel, for an aggregate purchase price of $287.5 million, subject to regulatory approvals, consents and other customary closing conditions and includes potential adjustments based on working capital, net cash, loss or destruction of rigs and drilling contract backlog. We expect to complete the remaining two closings with ADES in the first quarter of 2019.
In December of 2018, we agreed to sell our surface data logging business to Excellence Logging for $50 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing working capital adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019.

In October of 2018, we agreed to sell our Reservoir Solutions business, also known as our laboratory services business to an affiliate of CSL Capital Management, L.P., for an aggregate purchase price of $205 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing working capital adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019.
In December of 2017, we completed the sale of our U.S. pressure pumping and pump-down perforating assets for $430 million in cash. We sold our related facilities, field assets, and supplier and customer contracts related to these businesses. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.
Reporting Segments
The Company's chief operating decision maker (its chief executive officer) regularly reviews information by our two reportable segments, which are our Western Hemisphere and Eastern Hemisphere segments. These reportable segments are based on management’s organization and view of Weatherford’s business when making operating decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance. Research and development expenses are included in the results of our Western and Eastern Hemisphere segments. Our corporate and other expenses that do not individually meet the criteria for segment reporting are reported separately on the caption Corporate General and Administrative. 
Products and Services
Our principal business is to provide equipment and services to the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, both onshore and offshore. Product and services include: (1) Production, (2) Completions, (3) Drilling and Evaluation and (4) Well Construction.

Drilling and Evaluation comprises a suite of services ranging from early well planning to reservoir management. The drilling services offer innovative tools and expert engineering to increase efficiency and maximize reservoir exposure. The evaluation services merge wellsite capabilities including wireline, logging while drilling, and surface logging with laboratory-fluid and core analyses to reduce reservoir uncertainty. 
Drilling Services includes directional drilling, logging while drilling, measurement while drilling, and rotary-steerable systems. This service line also includes our full range of downhole equipment, including high-temperature and high-pressure sensors, drilling reamers, and circulation subs.
Managed Pressure Drilling helps to manage wellbore pressures to optimize drilling performance. The services incorporate various technologies, including rotating control devices and advanced automated control systems as well as several drilling techniques, such as closed-loop drilling, air drilling, managed-pressure drilling, and underbalanced drilling.
Surface Data Logging Systems provides real-time formation evaluation data by analyzing cuttings, gases, and fluids while drilling. Our offerings include conventional mud-logging services, drilling instrumentation, advanced gas analysis, and wellsite consultants. In December of 2018, we agreed to sell our surface data logging business, which is classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018.
Wireline Services includes openhole and cased-hole logging services that measure the physical properties of underground formations to determine production potential, locate resources, and detect cement and casing integrity issues. The service line also executes well intervention and remediation operations by conveying equipment via cable into oil and natural gas wells.
Reservoir Solutions provides rock and fluid analysis to evaluate hydrocarbon resources, advisory solutions with engineering strategy and technologies to support assets at various development stages, and software products to optimize production and automate drilling. In October of 2018, we agreed to sell our laboratory services business, which is classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018.
Well Construction builds or rebuilds well integrity for the full life cycle of the well. Using conventional to advanced equipment, we offer safe and efficient tubular running services in any environment. Our skilled fishing and re-entry teams execute under any contingency from drilling to abandonment, and our drilling tools provide reliable pressure control even in extreme wellbores. We also include our land drilling rig business as part of Well Construction.

Other Business Data

Competition
We provide our products and services worldwide and compete in a variety of distinct segments with a number of competitors. Our principal competitors include Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes (a GE company), National Oilwell Varco, Nabors Industries and Frank’s International. We also compete with various other regional suppliers that provide a limited range of equipment and services tailored for local markets. Competition is based on a number of factors, including performance, safety, quality, reliability, service, price, response time and, in some cases, breadth of products. The oilfield services business is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed. Additionally, the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of our competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.
Raw Materials

We purchase a wide variety of raw materials as well as parts and components made by other manufacturers and suppliers for use in our manufacturing. Many of the products or components of products sold by us are manufactured by other parties. We are not dependent in any material respect on any single supplier for our raw materials or purchased components.
Customers

Substantially all of our customers are engaged in the energy industry. Most of our international sales are to large international or national oil companies. As of December 31, 2018, the Eastern Hemisphere accounted for 55% of our net outstanding accounts receivables and the Western Hemisphere accounted for 45% of our net outstanding accounts receivables. As of December 31, 2018, our net outstanding accounts receivable in the U.S. accounted for 18% of our balance and Mexico accounted for approximately 10% of our balance. No other country accounted for more than 10% of our net outstanding accounts receivables balance. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. 
Backlog 
Our services are usually short-term in nature, day-rate based and cancellable should our customers wish to alter the scope of work. Consequently, our backlog of firm orders is not material to the Company.
Research, Development and Patents

We maintain world-class technology and training centers throughout the world. Additionally, we have research, development and engineering facilities that are focused on improving existing products and services and developing new technologies to meet customer demands for improved drilling performance and enhanced reservoir productivity. Weatherford has also developed significant expertise, trade secrets, and know-how with respect to manufacturing equipment and providing services. 

As many areas of our business rely on patents and proprietary technology, we seek patent protection both inside and outside the U.S. for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. We amortize patents over the years that we expect to benefit from their existence, which typically extends from the grant of the patent through and until 20 years after the filing date of the patent application. 

Although in the aggregate our patents are important to the manufacturing and marketing of many of our products and services, we do not believe that the expiration of any one of our patents would have a material adverse effect on our business.

Seasonality

Weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the level of demand for our products and services. Spring months in Canada and winter months in the North Sea and Russia can affect our operations negatively. Additionally, heavy rains or an exceedingly cold winter in a given region or climate changes may impact our results. The unpredictable or unusually harsh weather conditions could lengthen the periods of reduced activity and have a detrimental impact to our results of operations. The widespread geographical locations of our operations serve to mitigate the overall impact of the seasonal nature of our business.
Federal Regulation and Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the energy industry in general and the environment in particular. Our 2018 expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations were not material, and we currently do not expect the cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations for 2019 to be material.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 26,500 employees, which is 9% and 12% lower than our workforce as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In response to the price of crude oil and a lower level of exploration and production spending for the last three years, we have reduced our overall costs and workforce to better align with activity levels. See “Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 – Restructuring Charges” for details on our workforce reductions. In addition, our workforce has been reduced as a result of the dispositions of certain businesses. Certain of our operations are subject to union contracts and these contracts cover approximately 17% of our employees. We believe we have a dedicated and capable workforce despite the significant headcount reductions over the past three years, which were necessary to adapt our Company to the market conditions.
