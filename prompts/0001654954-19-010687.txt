 ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
  
 Overview
  
 We design, develop, and sell advanced rechargeable lithium-ion energy storage solutions as an alternative to lead-acid batteries [and propane-based solutions] for lift trucks, airport ground support equipment (GSE) and other industrial motive applications. Our “LiFT” battery packs, including our proprietary battery management system (BMS), provide our customers with a better performing, cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternative, in many instances, to traditional lead-acid and propane-based solutions.
  
 We launched our LiFT packs for the Class 3 Walkie Pallet Jack (Class 3 Walkie) product line in 2014. We have received Underwriters Laboratory (UL) Listing on our Class 3 Walkie Pallet Jack (Class 3 Walkie) LiFT pack product line in 2016 and expect to seek UL Listing during calendar 2019 for our other product lines, which include Class 1 Counterbalance/Sit down/Ride-on (Class 1 Ride-on) LiFT packs , Class 2 Narrow Aisle LiFT packs, and Class 3 End Rider LiFT packs. We believe that a UL Listing demonstrates the safety, reliability and durability of our products and gives us an important competitive advantage over other lithium-ion energy suppliers. Our Class 3 Walkie LiFT packs have been approved for use by leading industrial motive manufacturers, including Toyota Material Handling USA, Inc., Crown Equipment Corporation, and Raymond Corporation.
  
 Within our industrial market segments, we believe that our LiFT pack solutions provide cost and performance benefits over existing lead-acid power products including:
  
  ● 
 longer operation and more shifts with fewer batteries;

  ● 
 reduced energy and maintenance costs;

  ● 
 faster recharging; and

  ● 
 longer lifespan.

 
 Historically, lead-acid batteries dominated this market. However, their share has been gradually declining given significant safety and environmental issues related to the toxic nature of their components and other limitations of these legacy solutions. For example, lead-acid batteries are subject to Environmental Protection Agency lead-acid battery reporting requirements, may create an environmental hazard in the event of a cell breach, and emit combustible gases during charging. Rechargeable lithium-ion energy solutions such as ours do not pose such environmental concerns. As lithium-based solutions have declined in price and improved in reliability, today, they provide a cost-effective solution with an improved environmental profile.
  
 As a result of the advantages lithium-ion battery technology provide over lead-acid batteries, we have experienced significant growth in our business. We believe we are at the very early stage of a trend toward the adoption of lithium-ion technology and the displacement of lead-acid and propane-based energy storage solutions. We believe the annual addressable forklift market in North America for lithium-ion battery is $2.4 billion. We calculate this figure based on Industrial Truck Association (ITA) U.S. Factory Shipments data for 2017 (75,446 for Classes 1 and 2 Ride-on and Narrow Aisle, and 68,979 for Class 3 Walkie) and multiplying it by our estimated mid-point suggested retail prices for the different sizes of lithium-ion battery packs ($24,000 for Classes 1 and 2 Ride-on and Narrow Aisle, and $8,250 for Class 3 Walkie). The estimated $2.4 billion addressable market does not include other opportunities available to us. For example, we estimate that migrating existing buyers of Classes 4 and 5 Internal Combustion Sit-on to Class 1 Ride-on LiFT packs would expand our addressable market to be around $2.1 billion based on 87,271 Classes 4 & 5 Internal Combustion Sit-on LiFT packs shipped in 2017 as reported by ITA.

 Critical to our success is our innovative and proprietary high power BMS that enables multiple battery cells to work in tandem, optimizes the performance of our LiFT packs and provides a platform for adding new battery pack features, including customized telemetry for customers. The BMS serves as the brain of the battery pack, managing cell balancing, charging, discharging, monitoring and communication between the pack and the forklift. We believe our expertise in managing a variety of lithium cell formats using a modular, scalable and customizable approach creates a competitive advantage for us. A key component of this solution is our proprietary BMS.
  
 Our engineers design, develop, service, and test our products. We source our battery cells from multiple suppliers in China and the remainder of the components primarily from vendors in the United States. Final assembly, testing and shipping of our products is done from our ISO 9001 certified facility in Vista, California, which includes three assembly lines.
  
 Recent Corporate Transactions
  
 The Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse split of our common stock and preferred stock on July 11, 2019 (2019 Reverse Split). No fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2019 Reverse Split. If, as a result of the 2019 Reverse Split, a stockholder would otherwise have been entitled to a fractional share, each fractional share was rounded up. The 2019 Reverse Split resulted in a reduction of our outstanding shares of common stock from 51,000,868 to 5,101,580. In addition, it resulted in a reduction of our authorized shares of common stock from 300,000,000 to 30,000,000, and a reduction of our authorized shares of preferred stock from 5,000,000 to 500,000. All references to shares of common stock and related per share data for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained have been adjusted to reflect the 2019 Reverse Split on a retroactive basis.
DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS
  
 Our Business
  
 We have leveraged our decade of experience in lithium-ion technology to design and develop a suite of LiFT pack product lines that we believe provide attractive solutions to customers seeking an alternative to lead-acid and propane-based power products. We believe the following attributes are significant contributors to our success:
  
 Engineering and integration experience in lithium-ion for motive applications: We have been developing lithium-ion applications for the advanced energy storage market since 2010, starting with products for automotive electric vehicle manufacturers. We believe our expertise in management of large format lithium cells and overall experience in control and integration of battery modules has enabled us to develop superior solutions.
  
 UL Listing: We launched our LiFT packs for the Class 3 Walkie product line in 2014 and obtained our UL Listing for all three different power configurations in January 2016. We believe this UL Listing gives us a significant competitive advantage and provides assurance to customers that our technology has been rigorously tested by an independent third party and determined to be safe, durable and reliable. We believe that the process involved in obtaining UL Listing has enabled us to substantially enhance our entire family of products, including in the areas of overall design and durability, which we believe has improved the performance and overall value of our LiFT packs. We are seeking to obtain additional UL Listings for our other LiFT pack product lines during calendar 2019.
  
 Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) approvals: Our Class 3 Walkie LiFT packs have been tested and approved for use by Toyota Material Handling USA, Inc., Crown Equipment Corporation, and Raymond Corporation, among the top global lift truck manufacturers by revenue according to Material Handling & Logistics. We also provide a “private label” LiFT pack for a Class 3 Walkie LiFT pack to a major forklift OEM.

 Broad product offering and scalable design: We offer LiFT packs for use in a variety of industrial motive applications. We believe that our modular and scalable design enables us to optimize design, inventory, and part count to accommodate natural product extensions of our products to meet customer requirements. Based on our Class 3 Walkie LiFT pack design, we have expanded our produce lines to include Class 1 Ride-on, Class 2 Narrow Aisle, and Class 3 End Rider LiFT pack product lines as well as airport GSE packs. Our modular design enables us to group cells in certain unit counts and electrical connections (series vs. parallel) that can be easily modified to satisfy a wide range of power requirements for varying voltages, current amperages, and kilowatt power ratings. The modular design also includes three (3) different physical formats to accommodate a variety of dimension requirements.
  
 Significant advantages over lead acid and propane solutions: We believe that lithium-ion battery systems have significant advantages over existing technologies and will displace lead-acid batteries and propane-based solutions, in most applications, because they have a number of advantages over these legacy technologies. Relative to lead-acid batteries, such advantages include environmental benefits, no water maintenance, faster charge times, greater cycle life and longer run times that provide operational and financial benefits to customers. Compared to propane solutions, lithium-ion systems avoid the generation of exhaust emissions and associated odor and environmental contaminates, and maintenance of an internal combustion engine, which has substantially more parts than an electric motor.
  
 Proprietary Battery Management System: We have developed a high power BMS that is incorporated into our entire product family. The BMS serves as the brain of the battery pack, managing cell balancing, charging, discharging, monitoring and communication between the battery pack and the forklift. Our BMS is specifically designed for the industrial motive application environment and is adaptable to meet custom requirements. The system is optimized to meet the operational requirements of material handling and airport ground support equipment and to work with the LiFePO4 battery chemistry (although we can easily accommodate other lithium-ion chemistries). We have designed our BMS to interface with telematics systems to enable remote diagnostics, software upgrades and early warnings to fleet managers. Our next generation BMS design will be released in fiscal year 2020 and incorporate advanced automotive chip technologies that will enable faster, lower cost, more extensive data logging and easier re-configurations for product extensions.
  
 Our Products
  
 We have developed, tested, and sold our LiFT packs for use in a broad range of lift trucks, as pictured and described below, including Class 3 Walkie and End Riders, Class 2 Narrow Aisle, and Class 1 Ride-on, as well as for airport GSE. Within each of these product segments, there is a range of power and equipment variations. With these variations in mind, we designed our LiFT packs to address most variations, with only minor modifications needed to fit the remaining low volume applications.

 Because we are addressing a wide range of power and energy requirements across broad industrial motive applications, we have taken a modular approach to our battery pack system design. We have three core design modules that are used in our entire family of forklift products. Our core modules are designed for small, medium, and large packs. The design of each core module is driven by power and physical space sizing. The core module for our small LiFT pack, which fits a Class 3 Walkie, is a 24-volt lithium pack (figure below) comprised of individual 3.2-volt cells. The medium and large cored modules are designed to accommodate larger equipment size and power by adding more cells and components. These larger designs support 36-volt, 48-volt, and 72-volt applications with power requirements up to 900Ah (amps per hour or “current” rating), which enables us to offer a full product line-up.
  
 We are able to offer varying chemistries and configurations based on the specific application. Currently, our LiFT packs use lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery cells, which we source from a variety of overseas suppliers that meet our power, reliability, safety and other specifications. Because our BMS is designed to work with numerous battery chemistries, we believe we can readily adapt our LiFT packs as new chemistries become available in the market or customer preferences change.
  
 We also offer 24-volt onboard chargers for our Class 3 Walkie LiFT packs, and smart “wall mounted” chargers for larger applications. Our smart charging solutions are designed to interface with our BMS.
  
 Industry Overview
  
 The motive energy storage markets have evolved from reliance primarily on lead-acid technologies created in the 1800s to increasing use of advanced chemistries that have the ability to store energy more efficiently and with lower environmental impact.
  
 Driven by overall growth in global demand for lithium-ion battery solutions, the supply of lithium-ion batteries has rapidly expanded, leading to price declines of eighty-five percent (85%) since 2010 according to BloombergNEF. BloombergNEF also estimates that lithium-ion battery pack prices, which averaged $1,160 per kilowatt hour in 2010, were $176 per kWh in 2018 and could drop below $100 in 2024.
  
 The sharp decline in the price of lithium-ion batteries has commenced a shift in customer preferences away from lead-acid and propane-based solutions for power lift equipment to lithium-ion based solutions. We believe our position as a pioneer in the field and our extensive experience providing lithium-ion based storage solutions makes us uniquely positioned to take advantage of this shift in customer preferences.

  Lift Equipment - Material Handling Equipment
  
 We focus on energy storage solutions for lift equipment and GSE because we believe they represent large and growing markets that are just beginning to adopt lithium-ion based technology. Our market opportunity includes not only solutions for new equipment but also the replacement market for existing lead acid battery packs.
  
 Historically, larger lift trucks were powered by internal combustion engines, using propane as a fuel, with smaller equipment powered by lead-acid batteries. Over the past thirty (30) years, there has been a significant shift toward electric power. According to Liftech/ITA, over this time period the percentage of lift trucks powered electrically has doubled from approximately thirty percent (30%) to over sixty percent (60%).
 
 According to Modern Materials Handling, worldwide new lift truck orders reached approximately 1.4 million units in 2017. The Industrial Truck Association has estimated that approximately 200,000 lift trucks had been sold yearly since 2013 in North America (Canada, the United States and Mexico), including approximately 260,000 units sold in 2018, with sales relatively evenly distributed between electric rider (Class 1 and Class 2), motorized hand (Class 3), and internal combustion engine powered lift trucks (Class 4 and Class 5). The ITA estimates that electric products represented approximately sixty-four percent (64%) of the North American market in 2018. Driven by growth in global manufacturing, e-commerce and construction, Research and Markets expects that the global lift truck market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of six and four-tenths percent (6.4%) through 2024.
  
  Customer Concentrations
  
 We currently sell products directly to our customers, through OEMs, lift equipment dealers, battery distributors and the ultimate end-user. Our direct customers vary from small companies to Fortune 500 companies.
  
 During the year ended June 30, 2019, we had four major customers that each represented more than 10% of our revenues on an individual basis, or approximately $8,072,000 or 87% of our total revenues. 
  
 During the year ended June 30, 2018, we had two major customers that each represented more than 10% of our revenues on an individual basis, or approximately $3,181,000 or 77% of our total revenues.
  
 Shift Toward Lithium-ion Battery Technologies
  
 We expect that there will be a significant increase in demand for safe and efficient alternatives to lead-acid and propane-based power products. There are a number of factors driving the change in customer preference away from these legacy products and toward lithium-ion energy storage solutions:
 
 Duration of Charge/Run Times: Lithium-based energy storage systems can perform for a longer duration compared to lead-acid batteries. Lithium-ion batteries provide up to 50% longer run times than lead-acid batteries of comparable capacity, or amps-per-hour rating, allowing equipment to be operated over a long period of time between charges.
  
 High/Sustained Power: Lithium-ion batteries are better suited to deliver high power versus legacy lead-acid. For example, a 100Ah lead acid battery will only deliver 80Ah if discharged over a four-hour period. In contrast, a 100Ah lithium-ion system will achieve over 92Ah even during a 30 minute discharge. Additionally, during discharge, the LiFT pack sustains its initial voltage, maximizing the performance of the forklift truck, whereas, lead acid voltages, and hence power, decline over the working shift.
  
 Charging Time: Lead acid batteries are limited to one shift a day, as they discharge for eight hours, need eight hours for charging, and another eight hours for cooling. For multi-shift operations, this typically requires battery changeout for the equipment. Because lithium batteries can be recharged in as little as one hour and do not degrade when subjected to opportunity charging, battery changeout is unnecessary.

 Safe Operation: The toxic nature of lead-acid batteries presents significant safety and environmental issues in the event of a cell breach. During charging, lead-acid batteries emits combustible gases and increases in temperature. Lithium-ion (particularly LFP) batteries do not get as hot and avoid many of the safety and environmental issues associated with lead-acid batteries.
  
 Extended Life: The performance of lead-acid batteries degrades after approximately 500 charging cycles in industrial equipment applications. In comparison, lithium-ion batteries last up to five times longer in the same application.
  
 Size and Weight: Lithium is about one-third the weight of lead acid for comparable power ratings, enhancing the ability to provide power to equipment of many shapes and sizes.
  
 Lower Cost: Lithium-ion batteries provide power dense solutions with extended cycle life, reduced maintenance and improved operational performance, resulting in lower total cost of ownership.
  
 Marketing and Sales
  
 In the industrial motive market, OEMs sell their lift products through dealer networks and directly to end customers. Because of environmental issues associated with lead-acid batteries and to preserve customer choice, industrial lift products are typically sold without a battery pack. Equipment dealers source battery packs from battery distributors and battery pack suppliers based on demand or in response to customer specifications. End customers may specify a specific type and manufacturer of battery pack to the equipment dealer or may purchase battery packs from battery distributors or directly from battery suppliers. Consequently, we sell our products through a number of different channels, including directly to end users, OEMs and lift equipment dealers or through battery distributors.
  
 Our four-person direct sales team is assigned to major geographies nation-wide to collaborate with our sales partners who have an established customer base. We are seeking to hire additional sales staff to support our expected sales growth. In addition, we have developed a nation-wide sales network of relationships with equipment OEMs, their dealers, and battery distributors.
  
 We have worked directly with a number of OEMs to secure “technical approval” for compatibility of our LiFT packs with their equipment. Once we receive that approval, we focus on developing a sales network utilizing existing battery distributors and equipment dealers, along with the OEM corporate national account sales force, to drive sales through this channel.
  
 As our LiFT packs have gained acceptance in the marketplace, we have seen an increase in direct-to-end-customer sales, ranging from small enterprises to Fortune 500 companies. To expand our customer reach, we have begun to market directly to end users, primarily focusing on large fleets operated by Fortune 500 companies seeking productivity improvements. We have seen initial success in these efforts, including sales to a Fortune 100 heavy machinery conglomerate. Our marketing efforts to these customers focus on the economic and cost benefits of lithium-ion batteries over lead acid batteries in their equipment.
  
 Our product development efforts have included pilot programs and trials with national account end users. This has resulted in increased sales to these end users as many of them seek to replace lead-acid batteries with lithium power packs in their fleets as they buy new equipment.
  
 To support our products, we have a nation-wide network of service providers, typically forklift equipment dealers and battery distributors, who provide local support to large customers. We utilize a discount price to our standard retail prices to compensate our partners for customer orders and service availability. We also maintain a call center and provide Tech Bulletins and training to our service and sales network out of our corporate headquarters.
  
 Our warranty policy for our family of forklift products includes a limited five-year warranty. Warranty claims are handled by our call center that determines the appropriate response path: return pack, field fix by approved technician on location, or technical resolution by the call center. Our approved field technicians are typically equipment dealers or battery distributors, charging agreed upon discounted rates to their “street rates.”

 We partner with Averest, Inc., an experienced GSE distributor, to market our lithium-ion battery packs for airport GSE. Our sales cycle for GSE equipment has required initial multi-month evaluation periods of packs prior to ordering. After initial shipments, subsequent ordering is dependent upon operating requirements and capital budgeting.
  
 We customarily maintain a relatively small inventory of Class 3 Walkie LiFT packs, which typically have shorter customer timing requirements than other lift equipment. For larger packs, we seek to align our inventory and production with historical OEM order patterns. Typically, we deliver larger packs on a four- to eight-week lead time. Because of associated lead times, we provide six-month rolling forecasts to our battery cell suppliers who manufacture and deliver to our forecast.
  
 Ordering patterns primarily reflect ordering patterns of new equipment, commonly done in monthly or quarterly stages by large customers, as single fleet-size orders would require significant planning and operational support to implement. Backlog varies with customers but is driven by operating timing. Customer payment terms are normally net 30 days, but certain large customers require extended payment terms, ranging from 45 to 60 days. We have experienced some seasonality, particularly in July, August and December.
  
 Manufacturing and Assembly
  
 We source our battery cells from multiple suppliers in China and the remainder of the components primarily from vendors in the United States. While we have experienced supply interruptions from time to time, none have been material. Production rates aligned with our forecasts have helped us mitigate the risk of disruption.
  
 We buy chargers from several sources, including a U.S. based supplier. Additionally, we are a qualified dealer for a well-known manufacturer of “high capacity, modular, smart chargers” which support our larger packs.
  
 Our BMS is not dependent on a specific lithium-ion chemistry or cell manufacturer, and we are agnostic to chemistry and supplier. We monitor and test potential new cell technologies on an ongoing basis
  
 Our BMS modules/boards are proprietary and have been granted two patents: (i) a 12-volt battery design; and (ii) a battery display design. Component acquisition and assembly of the BMS modules/boards are outsourced to two local, Southern California board houses, both of whom meet our quality and other specifications.
  
 Final assembly, testing and shipping of our products occur at our ISO 9001 certified facility in Vista, California, which includes three assembly lines.
  
 Research and Development
  
 Our engineers design, develop, service, and test our products. We believe our core competencies and capabilities are designing and developing proprietary technology for our BMS, systems engineering, engineering application, and software engineering for both battery packs and telemetry. We believe that our ability to develop new features and technology for our BMS is essential to our growth strategy.
  
 Research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $4,088,000 and $1,956,000, respectively. Such expenses consist primarily of materials, supplies, salaries and personnel related expenses, stock-based compensation expense, consulting costs and other expenses. Research and development expenses in fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 were higher than fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to the development, implementation, and UL testing of the higher capacity packs for Class 1, 2, and 3 forklifts.
  
 As we continue to develop our product offerings, we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to be a substantial part of our focus. We perform our research and development at our facility in Vista, California. We seek to develop innovative new and improved products for cell and system management along with associated communication, display, current sensing and charging tools.

 Competition
  
 Our competitors in the lift equipment market are primarily major lead-acid battery manufacturers, including Exide Technologies, East Penn Manufacturing Company, EnerSys Corporation, and Crown Battery Corporation. We do not believe that these suppliers offer lithium-based products for lift equipment in any significant volume to end users, equipment dealers, OEMs or battery distributors. Several OEMs offer lithium-ion battery packs on Class 3 forklifts for sale only with their own new forklifts. As the demand for lithium-ion battery packs has increased, a number of [small] lithium battery pack providers have entered the market, most of whom we believe are suppliers of other power products and have simply added a lithium product to their product lines.
  
 The key competitive factors in this market are performance, reliability, durability, safety and price. We believe we compete effectively in all of these categories in light of our experience with lithium-ion technology, including our development capabilities and the performance of our proprietary BMS. We believe that the UL Listing covering our entire Class 3 Walkie LiFT pack product line is a significant differentiating competitive advantage and we intend to extend that advantage by seeking to obtain UL Listings for our other LiFT pack products during calendar 2019. In addition, because our BMS is not reliant on any specific battery cell chemistry, we believe we can adapt rapidly to changes in advanced battery technology or customer preferences.
  
 Intellectual Property
  
 Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents pending, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. In addition to such factors as innovation, technological expertise and experienced personnel, we believe that a strong patent position is important to remain competitive.
  
 As of June 30, 2019, we have two issued patents and three trademark registrations protecting the Flux Power name and logo. We intend to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology, including our next generation BMS 2.0, which we plan to release for production later this year. We also intend to seek protection of our intellectual property internationally in a broad range of areas. We do not know whether any of our efforts will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. We have two granted patents: (i) a 12-volt battery design and (ii) a battery display design. Based on next generation BMS, we plan to file four utility patents within this year.
  
 Suppliers
  
 We obtain a limited number of components and supplies included in our products from a small group of suppliers. During the year ended June 30, 2019 we had three suppliers who accounted for more than 10% of our total purchases, on an individual basis. Purchases for these three suppliers totaled $6,855,000 or 62% of our total purchases.
  
 During the year ended June 30, 2018 we had three suppliers who accounted for more than 10% of our total purchases, on an individual basis. Purchases for these three suppliers totaled $2,285,000 or 50% of our total purchases.
  
 In the past we have sourced lithium batteries from a number of suppliers. We continuously assess our battery sourcing to improve consistency, responsiveness, and quality.
  
 Government Regulations
  
 Product Safety Regulations. Our products are subject to product safety regulations by Federal, state, and local organizations. Accordingly, we may be required, or may voluntarily determine to obtain approval of our products from one or more of the organizations engaged in regulating product safety. These approvals could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and, if redesign were necessary, could result in a delay in the introduction of our products in various markets and applications.
  
   
 
12


  
 
 Environmental Regulations. Federal, state, and local regulations impose significant environmental requirements on the manufacture, storage, transportation, and disposal of various components of advanced energy storage systems. Although we believe that our operations are in material compliance with current applicable environmental regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities.
  
 Moreover, Federal, state, and local governments may enact additional regulations relating to the manufacture, storage, transportation, and disposal of components of advanced energy storage systems. Compliance with such additional regulations could require us to devote significant time and resources and could adversely affect demand for our products. There can be no assurance that additional or modified regulations relating to the manufacture, storage, transportation, and disposal of components of advanced energy systems will not be imposed.
  
 Occupational Safety and Health Regulations. The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) and other regulatory agencies have jurisdiction over the operations of our Vista, California facility. Because of the risks generally associated with the assembly of advanced energy storage systems we expect rigorous enforcement of applicable health and safety regulations. Frequent audits by or changes, in the regulations issued by Cal/OSHA, or other regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our operations, may cause unforeseen delays and require significant time and resources from our technical staff.
  
 Employees
  
 As of June 30, 2019, we had seventy-five (75) full-time employees. We engage outside consultants for business development and operations or other functions from time to time. None of our employees are currently represented by a trade union.
