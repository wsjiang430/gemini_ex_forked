BUSINESS 
 Overview 
 We are a biotechnology company that uses our robust, chemistry-driven approach and drug discovery capabilities to create small molecule drugs primarily for the treatment of viral infections and liver diseases. We discovered glecaprevir, the second protease inhibitor discovered and developed through our collaboration with AbbVie for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus, or HCV. Glecaprevir is co-formulated as part of AbbVie’s leading direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combination treatment for HCV, which is marketed under the tradenames MAVYRET® (U.S.) and MAVIRET™ (ex-U.S.) (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir). Our royalties from our AbbVie collaboration and our existing financial resources provide us funding to support our wholly-owned research and development programs, which are primarily focused on the following disease targets with the following compounds in clinical development: 

• | EDP-938, for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, infection, the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children and a significant cause of respiratory illness in older adults, with estimates suggesting that approximately 200,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. and EU occur each year in children under the age of two and approximately 170,000 hospitalizations in these regions occur each year in adults over the age of 65;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | EDP-305, for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, a liver disease estimated to affect approximately 1.5% to 6.5% of the population in the developed world (which translates to approximately 5 to 20 million individuals in the U.S. alone); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | EDP-514, for hepatitis B virus, or HBV, the most prevalent chronic hepatitis, which is estimated to affect approximately 250 million individuals worldwide.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We had approximately $400 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities at September 30, 2019. In fiscal 2019, we earned $205.2 million in product royalties on AbbVie’s net sales of its HCV regimens. We expect our existing financial resources and cash flows from continuing AbbVie royalties will allow us to continue to fund our wholly-owned research and development programs for the foreseeable future.
 Our Wholly-Owned Programs 
 Our wholly-owned research and development programs are in virology, namely RSV and HBV, and in liver disease (non-virology), namely NASH and PBC: 
  
• | RSV: We discovered EDP-938, a potent N-protein inhibitor of activity of both major subgroups of RSV, referred to as RSV-A and RSV-B, and have tested it as our first clinical candidate for RSV. EDP-938, which has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is the only N-protein inhibitor in clinical development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In June 2019, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 2a human challenge study of EDP-938 in healthy adults infected with a specific strain of RSV.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Data from this study demonstrated that EDP-938 achieved a highly statistically significant reduction (p=<0.001) both in viral load and in resolution of clinical symptoms compared to placebo. In addition, the study showed that mean trough levels of drug achieved in study subjects were 20-40x higher than the amount of EDP-938 that has been shown in previously reported in vitro studies to reduce 90% of the viral RNA in RSV-infected human cells. During October 2019 as part of IDWeekTM, the Company presented additional results of the RSV quantitative viral culture assay (Log10 plaque forming units/mL) which demonstrated highly statistically significant (p<0.001) reductions in RSV viral load area under the curve (AUC) of 82.53% and 77.43%, in the QD (once a day) and BID (twice a day) arms, respectively, compared to the placebo arm and without a significant difference between the dosing groups. Additionally, there were highly statistically significant reductions (p<0.001) in RSV-associated nasal mucus production (mucus weight) of 72.06% and 77.67% in the QD and BID arms, respectively, compared to placebo and without a significant difference between the dosing groups.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o | Overall, EDP-938 was generally well tolerated in the study and demonstrated a favorable safety profile that was comparable to placebo over 5 days of dosing through Day 28 of follow-up. There were no serious adverse events and no discontinuations of EDP-938.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In November 2019, we initiated our first Phase 2b study of EDP-938, which is in adult outpatients with community-acquired RSV infection. This study, named RSVP, is designed to help us better understand the feasibility of this direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. At the same time, we are preparing to conduct further studies in targeted patient populations such as the immune-compromised, the elderly and pediatric populations. If we are able to complete the RSVP study in one RSV season in North America, topline data could be announced in the third quarter of calendar 2020.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We believe EDP-938 is differentiated from fusion inhibitors currently in development for RSV because N-protein inhibitors directly target the viral replication process of RSV and have demonstrated high barriers to resistance against RSV in vitro.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NASH: We are working on compounds, referred to as FXR agonists, that selectively bind to and activate the farnesoid X receptor, or FXR. FXR agonists have shown efficacy in NASH and we believe that this mechanism has promise as an important component in potential combination therapies for NASH. We have EDP-305 ready for a Phase 2b study and we have identified a follow-on compound, EDP-297, to initiate clinical development in mid-calendar 2020. We plan to develop at least one of these compounds primarily for use in combination treatments of NASH, a liver disease with very few therapeutic options. Our lead FXR agonist, EDP-305, represents a class of FXR agonists designed to take advantage of increased binding interactions with this receptor. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In September 2019, we announced results of our ARGON-1 study, a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of EDP-305 in a NASH population. The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate change in ALT levels at week 12 and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EDP-305. Key secondary objectives included change in liver fat content by MRI-PDFF, change in lipids, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic parameters, including C4 and FGF19.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The study’s primary endpoint was achieved with a statistically significant ALT reduction of 28 U/L in the EDP-305 2.5mg arm versus 15 U/L in the placebo arm at week 12 (p=0.049). There was also a statistically significant reduction in liver fat content with EDP-305 at the 2.5mg dose as measured by MRI-PDFF (p<0.001). The 1.0 mg arm showed non-statistically-significant numerical trends in reduction of these biomarkers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | EDP-305 exhibited strong target engagement as shown by reductions in C4 and increases in FGF-19 and ALP. A robust GGT reduction was also observed.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Overall, EDP-305 was generally safe, with the majority of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) being mild to moderate. The most common (≥5%) TEAEs included pruritus, gastro-intestinal (GI) related symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), headache, and dizziness.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | As for tolerability of EDP-305 in this 12-week Phase 2a study, pruritus was present in approximately 51% of the subjects in the 2.5mg arm compared to less than 10% in the 1mg arm, with the majority being mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of treatment discontinuation due to pruritus was 1.8% for the 1mg dose and 20.8% for the 2.5mg dose, with all the discontinuations in the 2.5mg arm being due to moderate pruritus.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Treatment with EDP-305 was associated with small absolute changes in lipids.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

o | In the second quarter of calendar 2020, we plan to initiate a 72-week Phase 2b study, named ARGON-2, with histological endpoints, including fibrosis in biopsy-confirmed NASH patients treated with EDP-305 or placebo. The study will include an interim analysis to enhance our ability to seek opportunities more quickly for development of EDP-305 in combinations with other mechanisms for NASH.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Additionally, in November 2019, we identified EDP-297 as our follow-on FXR development candidate, for which we expect to initiate Phase 1 development in mid-calendar 2020.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Preclinical data on EDP-297 reveal a profile that delivers high target-tissue distribution along with greater potency than that published on any FXR agonist in clinical development today. In preclinical models, EDP-297 delivered the drug preferentially to tissues with FXR receptors (e.g. liver and intestine), while minimizing drug levels in plasma. We believe that having a highly potent FXR agonist may allow for lower effective doses and reduced drug levels at non-targeted tissues, thereby potentially reducing pruritis if it is an off-target effect.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We also have an ongoing Phase 2a study, named INTREPID, to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of EDP-305 in subjects with Primary Biliary Cholangitis, or PBC, a chronic liver disease that slowly destroys bile ducts in the liver.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | In September 2019, we announced that we had determined, based on preliminary data, that the INTREPID study had achieved sufficient enrollment to allow us to make an informed decision about EDP-305 development for the treatment of PBC. We expect to have data from this study in the second quarter of calendar 2020.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | EDP-305 has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of NASH patients with liver fibrosis and separately for the treatment of PBC.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In addition, we have been pursuing research in other mechanisms that may provide therapeutic benefit in NASH, any of which could be used in combination therapies for NASH.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HBV: In July 2019, we announced initiation of a Phase 1a/1b clinical study of EDP-514, our lead core inhibitor for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which has also been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1a/1b study is designed to evaluate first the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of EDP-514 in healthy subjects, and then the antiviral activity of EDP-514 in nucleos(t)ide-reverse-transcriptase (NUC)-suppressed patients with chronic HBV infection. The completion of the SAD and MAD part of the study is targeted for the first quarter of calendar 2020, when we will initiate Part 2 of the study to evaluate NUC-suppressed patients. We are also planning a separate Phase 1b study in viremic patients with chronic HBV infection, which we plan to initiate in the second quarter of calendar 2020. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | EDP-514 was selected from our lead class of HBV compounds that are characterized by potent antiviral activity. In vitro, these compounds are capable of preventing the establishment of cccDNA, are pan-genotypic, are active against known nucleos(t)ide resistant mutants, and are additive to synergistic with nucleoside analogs and other core inhibitors. Members of this class have also demonstrated excellent reductions in HBV titers in a chimeric mouse model with human liver cells.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In addition, we are also seeking patent protection and conducting preclinical experiments with compounds we have discovered that use other mechanisms to target HBV. We believe that it may be necessary to utilize more than one compound/mechanism for the treatment of HBV and therefore we are pursuing multiple approaches.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have utilized our internal chemistry and drug discovery capabilities to generate all of our development-stage programs. We continue to invest substantial resources in research programs to discover back-up compounds as well as new compounds targeting different mechanisms of action, in our areas of focus as well as in other areas.

Our Out-Licensed Products 
 Through our Collaborative Development and License Agreement with AbbVie, we have discovered and out-licensed to AbbVie two protease inhibitor compounds that have been clinically tested, manufactured, and commercialized by AbbVie as part of its combination regimens for HCV. We have earned all $330.0 million milestone payments under the agreement related to clinical development and commercialization regulatory approvals of these regimens in major markets.
  
• | Glecaprevir is the protease inhibitor we discovered that was developed by AbbVie in a fixed-dose combination with its NS5A inhibitor, pibrentasvir, for the treatment of HCV. This combination, currently marketed under the brand names MAVYRET® (U.S.) and MAVIRET™ (ex-U.S.) and referred to in this report as MAVYRET/MAVIRET. This regimen is a novel, once daily, all oral, fixed-dose, ribavirin-free treatment for HCV genotypes 1-6, or GT1-6, which is referred to as being pan-genotypic. In the U.S., EU and Japan it is approved as an 8-week treatment for patients with and without compensated cirrhosis and new to treatment. Today, these patients are estimated to represent the majority of HCV patients in developed country markets, and MAVYRET/MAVIRET remains the only 8-week pangenotypic HCV treatment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Since August 2017, substantially all of our royalty revenue has been derived from AbbVie’s net sales of MAVYRET/MAVIRET. Our ongoing royalty revenues from this regimen consist of annually tiered, double-digit, per-product royalties on 50% of the calendar year net sales of the 2-DAA glecaprevir/pibrentasvir combination in MAVYRET/MAVIRET (see Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). These royalties are calculated separately from the royalties on AbbVie’s paritaprevir-containing regimens, and the annual royalty tiers return to the lowest tier for sales on and after each January 1.

Our Strategy 
 Our primary objective is to become a leader in the field of viral infections and liver diseases in order to provide new treatments for patients with unmet medical needs. Our principal focus is on antiviral targets for viruses such as RSV and HBV, as well as liver diseases such as NASH. Our strategy includes the following key elements: 

• | Develop novel treatment options for RSV, NASH, and HBV. We have potential candidates in clinical development for our research programs in the diseases of RSV, NASH and HBV, which are therapeutic areas that have attracted research and development efforts of many competitors. We believe each of these diseases represents a substantial medical need for an effective, or more effective, treatment. In 2020 our lead compounds in RSV and NASH will be in Phase 2 studies and our lead HBV core inhibitor will be in two Phase 1b studies in chronic HBV patients. We expect these studies will provide us important data regarding the prospects of each of these three compounds, including in the case of NASH, both the first and second interim analyses planned for the ARGON-2 study.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Collaborate, where and when appropriate, with pharmaceutical partners to create combination therapies and accelerate the development and commercialization of our proprietary compounds. We are prepared to join forces, where and when appropriate, with collaborators with compounds targeting other mechanisms of action in diseases such as NASH and HBV, where there is the potential for better treatments with combination therapies. Our decisions regarding our proprietary programs will be based on the results of our early phase clinical studies and the potential for combinations with one or more drugs targeting other mechanisms of action in these diseases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest in research and development of additional product candidates in RSV, NASH and HBV. We are continuing to invest significant resources in our RSV, NASH and HBV research programs in an effort to identify and advance additional novel compounds that have the potential to address significant unmet medical needs in these disease areas. We may clinically explore other diseases where our assets could play a role. In addition, we may seek to augment our product candidate pipeline through the acquisition or in-licensing of external assets and/or technologies in one or more of our disease areas of focus.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to use our existing resources and future cash flow from our AbbVie collaboration to fund our research and development activities. We expect our existing financial resources and future royalty payments from our AbbVie collaboration will provide us substantial resources to fund our research and development programs for the foreseeable future. These resources will allow us to continue to advance

compounds in clinical development as well as to progress the most promising candidates at least through proof-of-concept trials and for further development as a monotherapy or in combinations with other therapeutic agents when we believe such combinations will provide the most promising opportunities.

Our Research and Development Pipeline
 The following table summarizes our product development pipeline in our virology and liver disease programs:
Our RSV Program 
 Background and Overview of RSV 
 Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a virus that infects the lungs and is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children and a significant cause of respiratory illness in older adults. Estimates suggest that approximately 200,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. and EU occur each year in children under the age of two and a similar number of hospitalizations in these regions occur each year in adults over the age of 65. In one large U.S.-based study, RSV infection in children was associated with 20% of hospitalizations, 18% of emergency department visits, and 15% of pediatric office visits for acute respiratory infections in the November-April timeframe. There are currently no safe and effective therapies for already established RSV infection. 
 Scientific Background
 RSV is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. The RSV genome consists of ten genes that encode for 11 proteins, namely NS1, NS2, N, P, M, SH, G, F, M2-1, M2-2, and L. The F and G proteins are the predominant target proteins for RSV vaccines. Similarly, small molecule therapeutics have focused primarily on the F (or fusion) 
 5


protein, while some efforts have targeted the N and L proteins. There are two major subgroups of RSV, designated RSV-A and RSV-B, each of which contains numerous genotypes. Both groups are viewed as capable of causing RSV infections that can result in hospitalization.
Several companies are seeking new antiviral treatments for RSV infection in adult and pediatric patients. Ark Biosciences, Johnson & Johnson, and ReViral each have compounds in clinical development. A prophylactic, monoclonal-antibody-based treatment from MedImmune, which is commercialized by AbbVie outside of the U.S., is approved for infants considered at high risk for RSV infection; however studies have found that most young children with RSV infection were previously healthy, and thus would not normally be prescribed prophylactic treatment. In addition, a number of companies have RSV vaccines in development, primarily directed at prevention of RSV infection, and some companies are also evaluating vaccines in a therapeutic mode for treatment of established RSV infection.
EDP-938 and Our Approach to the Treatment of RSV 
 While a number of companies are developing potential approaches geared towards the F protein (or fusion protein, responsible for mediating viral entry of RSV into host cells), we are focused on other mechanisms, such as the N-protein pathway, that targets the replication process of RSV. It is possible that N-protein inhibitors may also be effective treatments at later stages of infection. To our knowledge, we are currently the only company with an N inhibitor in clinical development. 
 Through our internal chemistry efforts, we identified our lead clinical candidate, EDP-938. During preclinical studies, EDP-938 demonstrated a greater than 4-log reduction in viral load in an animal model challenged with RSV. Further, EDP-938 maintained antiviral potency across all clinical isolates tested in vitro, as well as virus that was resistant to fusion inhibitors. The compound inhibited RSV at a post-entry replication step and maintained its activity in vitro when given 24 hours post infection. In addition, combination studies of EDP-938 with other types of RSV inhibitors, such as fusion inhibitors, showed synergistic antiviral effects.
 During fiscal 2018, we initiated and completed a Phase 1 clinical study of EDP-938. On November 1, 2018, we presented full Phase 1 data at the 11th International Respiratory Syncytial Virus Symposium. The Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled, first-in-human study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) and food effect of EDP-938 in healthy subjects. Overall, no safety concerns were reported in 68 healthy subjects receiving a broad range of single and multiple doses of EDP-938. Headache was the most frequently reported AE during the SAD and MAD phases. There were no SAEs, and AEs were of mild intensity, with none leading to study drug discontinuation. EDP-938 was rapidly absorbed and exposure increased with increasing single and multiple dosing, resulting in a PK profile suitable for once or twice daily oral dosing regardless of food. In the MAD phase, half-life ranged from 12.9 to 17.6 hours, and at doses comparable to those under study in the Phase 2a trial, and mean trough levels were approximately 30x higher than the EC90 of EDP-938 against RSV-infected human cells. 
 Based on the results above, we initiated a Phase 2a challenge study of EDP-938 in October 2018. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, human challenge study of 115 healthy adult subjects that were randomized into 1 of 2 dosing arms or a placebo arm and received either a once-daily (QD) 600 mg dose, a single 500 mg loading dose (LD) followed by a 300 mg twice daily (BID) dose, or placebo, for 5 days. Data from this study demonstrated that EDP-938 achieved a highly statistically significant reductions (p=<0.001) in RSV viral load (by both qRT-PCR and plaque assays), total symptom scores and mucus weights compared to placebo. In addition, the study showed that mean trough levels of drug achieved in study subjects were 20-40x higher than the amount of EDP-938 that has been shown in previously reported in vitro studies to reduce 90% of the viral RNA in RSV-infected human cells. 
 Based on these results, in November 2019 we initiated our first Phase 2b study of EDP-938, which is being conducted in adult outpatients with RSV infection. This study, known as RSVP, is designed to provide further information about EDP-938 in a community-acquired RSV adult population and to better understand the feasibility of DAA therapy in an outpatient setting. We are planning to conduct future studies of EDP-938 in pediatric populations, as well as immune-compromised and other adult populations where RSV morbidity is significant. 
 The RSVP study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that is designed to enroll approximately 70 subjects, up to the age of 75 years, randomized to receive either 800 mg of EDP 938 or placebo for 5 days. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of EDP-938 on the progression of RSV infection by 
 6


assessment of clinical symptoms measured over the course of the 14-day study observation period. Antiviral efficacy will be evaluated as a key secondary endpoint.
 Depending upon the severity of the RSV season in North America and the rate of enrollment, our goal is to complete the RSVP study in one season and topline data could be announced in the third quarter of calendar 2020. If needed, however, we have plans to continue the study in the southern hemisphere where RSV infection occurs later in the year. 
 Our FXR Program in NASH and PBC 
 Background and Overview of NASH and PBC 
 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, is the accumulation of excessive fat in liver cells in the form of triglycerides, a process known as hepatic steatosis, that is not associated with alcohol abuse. It is normal for the liver to contain some fat. However, if more than 5%-10% of the liver’s weight is fat, then it is called a fatty liver. A subgroup of NAFLD patients have liver cell injury and inflammation (steatohepatitis) in addition to excessive fat. Progression of this condition leads to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. Patients with NASH can develop fibrosis, a fibrous scarring of the liver, and ultimately cirrhosis of the liver. Typically scored on a scale of 1-4, also referred to as F1-F4, fibrosis in its earlier stages has been shown to be reversible, but in its most advanced stage results in cirrhosis, which is understood to be a more advanced, irreversible scarring of the liver, potentially leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or requiring a liver transplant. NASH is widely considered to be the liver expression of metabolic diseases related to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, hyperlipidemia and hypertension.   
 Stages of Liver Injury


According to the World Gastroenterology Organization Global Guidelines 2014, NASH is an increasingly common chronic liver disease with worldwide distribution that is closely associated with diabetes and obesity, which have both reached epidemic proportions. It is estimated that NASH is estimated to affect approximately 1.5% to 6.5% of the population in the developed world (which translates to approximately 5 to 20 million individuals in the U.S. alone). NASH and NAFLD are now considered the number one cause of liver disease in Western countries.
 Currently, there are no approved treatments for NASH. While patients presenting with NASH are counseled on lifestyle modifications, new effective treatments are urgently needed, particularly in the setting of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. We expect significant competition from other companies in the development of treatments for NASH and related conditions. Intercept Pharmaceuticals has completed a Phase 3 trial of OCALIVA® (obeticholic acid), or OCA, in NASH and has submitted regulatory filings in the U.S. for approval of OCA in NASH and plans to submit European regulatory filings by the end of 2019. We are aware of several other companies with NASH programs that are significantly more advanced than ours, including companies with compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials in NASH, namely Allergan, Galmed, Genfit and Madrigal. In addition, a number of companies have NASH or related programs with compounds in Phase 2 clinical trials. These companies include Akero, Alberio, Astra-Zeneca, BMS, Boehringer Ingelheim, Can-Fite BioPharma, Cirius, Cymabay, Galectin, , Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline, Immuron, Inventiva, Ionis, Lipocine, Medicinova, Metacrine, Northsea Therapeutics, Novartis, NGM, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Poxel, Second Genome, Viking and Zydus.

Primary biliary cholangitis (formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis), or PBC, is a chronic, or long-term, disease of the liver that slowly destroys the medium-sized bile ducts within the liver. Bile is a digestive liquid that is made in the liver. It travels through the bile ducts to the small intestine, where it helps digest fats and absorb fatty vitamins. In patients with PBC, the bile ducts are destroyed by inflammation. This causes bile to remain in the liver, where gradual injury damages liver cells and causes cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver. As cirrhosis progresses and the amount of scar tissue in the liver increases, the liver loses its ability to function, leading to potential liver failure, liver transplantation or hepatocellular carcinoma. PBC is a relatively rare disease (affecting an estimated 17,000 individuals in the U.S. and is 10 times more common in women than in men).
 Agonists of the farnesoid X receptor, referred to as FXR agonists, have shown promising activity in many preclinical models of liver disease. One FXR agonist, OCA, which was approved by the FDA in May 2016 for the treatment of PBC, has already demonstrated favorable clinical results in NASH. We believe that new FXR agonists may provide therapeutic benefit in NASH with advantages over OCA in terms of better efficacy, better tolerability or better safety or one or more of those advantages. 
 Scientific Background 
 FXR is a nuclear hormone receptor that functions to modulate gene expression in response to various metabolic stimuli. FXRs are expressed at high levels in the liver and intestine. Bile acids have been identified as important physiological ligands for FXRs, able to bind and activate the receptor. The downstream gene modulation resulting from bile acid engagement of FXRs not only contribute to the regulation of bile acid synthesis and metabolism, but is also involved in a number of other metabolic processes, in particular lipid metabolism. More recently, it has been discovered that bile acids, via FXR, are able to promote insulin sensitivity and decrease lipid synthesis in the liver. In addition, studies have shown that bile acid-dependent FXR activation is able to provide beneficial effects on fibrosis in the liver as well. For these reasons, FXR is considered to be a viable target for NASH. Phase 3 data with OCA, a synthetic analog of natural bile acids known to activate FXR, demonstrated efficacy in biopsy-confirmed NASH patients. In PBC, improved outcomes would be expected due to the reduction of bile acid synthesis by activation of FXR. OCA demonstrated efficacy in a Phase 3 trial in PBC, which was the basis for its conditional approval in the U.S. in May 2016 for the treatment of PBC in combination with first line therapy ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. 
 EDP-305 and Our Approach to the Treatment of NASH and PBC
 Even though there has been clinical validation demonstrated by the FXR agonist, OCA, we believe that there is an opportunity for the development of a treatment that shows improvements in potency and efficacy and reductions in potential safety liabilities for the treatment of NASH and PBC. Using our strong chemistry capabilities, we have undertaken the discovery and development of new FXR agonists that we believe may provide improvements over the FXR agonists currently in advanced clinical development.  
 EDP-305, our lead FXR agonist candidate, represents a class of FXR agonists that has been designed to take advantage of increased binding interactions with the receptor. Further, this non-bile acid class contains steroidal and non-steroidal components and does not contain the carboxylic acid group that can lead to the formation of taurine and glycine conjugates normally associated with bile acids, which may also be present in other classes of FXR agonists.
 We reported the results of our Phase 1 a/b clinical study of EDP-305 in October 2017. Our double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single ascending doses, or SAD, and multiple ascending doses, or MAD, of EDP-305 in adult healthy volunteer subjects, or HV subjects, and subjects with presumptive NAFLD, or PN subjects. By presumptive NAFLD, we mean adults who are obese, with or without pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes. 
 In this Phase 1 study, EDP-305 was shown to be generally safe and well tolerated over a broad range of single and multiple doses with pharmacokinetic, or PK, data supporting once daily oral dosing. EDP-305 exhibited strong engagement of the FXR receptor as evidenced by increased FGF19 levels and reduced C4 levels, which are proteins that can be monitored as downstream markers indicating FXR activity. 
 Based on the results of the Phase 1 study, we initiated two Phase 2 dose-ranging studies in fiscal 2018 –one in NASH patients, known as ARGON-1, and one in PBC patients, known as INTREPID. Both studies were 12-week, dose ranging, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. A new tablet formulation was utilized in these 
 8


Phase 2 studies at strengths of 1 mg and 2.5 mg (tablet formulation yields ~ 2X greater exposure than the suspension formulation used in the Phase 1 study).
 The primary objectives of the ARGON-1 study were to evaluate change in ALT levels at week 12 and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EDP-305 in a NASH population. Key secondary objectives included change in liver fat content by MRI-PDFF, change in lipids, and pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic parameters, including C4 and FGF19.
 The study’s primary endpoint was achieved with a statistically significant ALT reduction of 28 U/L in the EDP-305 2.5mg arm versus 15 U/L in the placebo arm at week 12 (p=0.049).  There was also a statistically significant reduction in liver fat content with EDP-305 at the 2.5mg dose as measured by MRI-PDFF (p<0.001). Forty-five percent of subjects were MRI-PDFF responders (i.e. ≥30% fat reduction). 
 EDP-305 exhibited strong target engagement as shown by reductions in C4 and increases in FGF-19 and ALP. A robust GGT reduction was also observed, with decreases observed at both doses vs. placebo.
 Overall, EDP-305 was generally safe, with the majority of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) being mild to moderate. The most common (≥5%) TEAEs included pruritus, gastro-intestinal (GI) related symptoms (nausea,vomiting, diarrhea), headache and dizziness. A consistent safety profile has been observed across more than 400 subjects exposed to EDP-305 across all studies to date. 
 As for tolerability of EDP-305 in this 12-week Phase 2a study, pruritus was present in approximately 51% of the subjects in the 2.5mg arm compared to less than 10% in the 1mg arm, with the majority being mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of treatment discontinuation due to pruritus was 1.8% for 1mg and 20.8% for 2.5mg, with all the discontinuations in the 2.5mg arm being due to moderate pruritus.
 Treatment with EDP-305 was associated with small absolute changes in LDL of 6 mg/dL, 5 mg/dL, and -4 mg/dL, with the 2.5mg dose, 1mg dose and placebo, respectively, and HDL. 
 We plan to initiate a 72-week Phase 2b study, named ARGON-2, in the second quarter of calendar 2020. ARGON-2 will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in approximately 340 subjects with biopsy-proven NASH. The primary endpoint of the study will be improvement of fibrosis without worsening of NASH and/or NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis. Two doses of EDP-305 have been selected to provide strong target engagement, and a balanced profile in terms of efficacy and tolerability. We plan to use doses of 1.5 mg and 2.0 mg with the aim of demonstrating stronger biomarker signals of efficacy than seen at 1.0 mg and less pruritus than seen at 2.5 mg, which were the doses investigated in the ARGON-1 study. This study will include a 12-week interim analysis designed to enhance our ability to seek opportunities more quickly for development of EDP-305 in combinations with other mechanisms in NASH.
 In the case of the ongoing INTREPID study, the objectives are to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of EDP-305 in subjects with PBC. In September 2019, we announced that we had determined, based on preliminary data, that this study had achieved sufficient enrollment to allow us to make an informed decision about EDP-305 development for the treatment of PBC. We expect to have data on this study in the second quarter of calendar 2020.
 EDP-297, Follow-On FXR Agonist
 We have identified EDP-297 as our follow-on FXR agonist candidate for NASH. Preclinical data on EDP-297 reveal a differentiated profile that delivers high target-tissue distribution, along with potency greater than that published on any FXR agonist in clinical development today. In preclinical models, EDP-297 delivered the drug preferentially to tissues with FXR receptors, namely liver and intestine, while minimizing drug levels in plasma and skin. We believe that having a highly potent and highly targeted FXR agonist like EDP-297 may allow for lower doses and reduced drug levels at non-targeted tissues, thereby potentially reducing pruritus if it is an off-target effect. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 study of EDP-297 in mid-calendar 2020 and plan to have data in the first half of calendar 2021.
 Our HBV Program 
 Background and Overview of HBV 
 Hepatitis B virus, or HBV, can cause potentially life-threatening liver infection. The virus is transmitted through contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of an infected person. It is estimated that approximately 250 million 
 9


people worldwide are chronically infected, and 15-25% of patients with chronic HBV infection develop chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, liver cancer, or liver decompensation. It is also estimated that more than 885,000 people worldwide died in 2015 due to complications of HBV. Estimates for the total number of persons chronically infected with HBV in the U.S. vary but generally range between 0.5 million and 2.0 million. Combining U.S., Japan, and major EU populations, estimates of HBV prevalence have been as high as 4.8 million.
Current approaches to treatment include interferon therapy and/or inhibitors of HBV reverse transcriptase, the enzyme responsible for viral DNA synthesis, which is necessary for HBV replication. Treatment with interferon offers modest cure rates, and is accompanied by serious side effects, including flu-like symptoms, fatigue, headache and nausea. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors can be very effective at suppressing the virus but often require lifelong therapy and rarely result in full eradication of the virus from the liver. New treatments that can provide functional cures to chronically-infected patients are urgently needed. 
 Scientific Background
 HBV is a partially double-stranded DNA virus with a complex life cycle. There are multiple mechanisms associated with HBV replication that could potentially be targeted with new drugs, and combination approaches may ultimately provide the most effective therapy for HBV. Mechanisms under study for HBV include:

• | Entry inhibitors that interfere with the initial binding of HBV to hepatocytes, thus preventing new infection from occurring.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inhibitors of covalently closed circular DNA, or cccDNA, the template for HBV replication, which are in early stages of development. Most of these inhibitors act in an indirect manner, such as preventing formation of cccDNA or silencing its transcription.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RNA silencing of gene expression, another prominent approach in the search for HBV inhibitors, which utilizes small interfering RNA’s (siRNA’s). This mechanism has the potential to significantly reduce HBV RNA, HBV DNA, and HBV protein levels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inhibition of the hepatitis B core protein, which plays a critical role in viral replication, intracellular trafficking, and maintenance of chronic infections. Using this core inhibitor mechanism (also known as capsid assembly inhibitor or core protein allosteric modifier), some initial data shows reduction in HBV DNA and HBV RNA in early clinical trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The surface antigen of HBV, or HBsAg, which is the main envelope protein of the virus and, another target in the HBV life cycle. HBsAg is critical to ongoing infection, and loss of serum HBsAg is associated with a functional cure of HBV, characterized by no inflammation, normal liver enzymes, and normal liver biopsy. Therefore, HBsAg is the target of several therapeutic approaches, including indirect ones such as siRNA mentioned above, but also specific approaches including the inhibition of HBsAg release.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The modulators of the human immune system, or immunomodulators, another major mechanism being researched. HBV has evolved to evade the natural host immune mechanisms that normally would clear a viral infection, thus approaches that can augment the immune response are being actively pursued. In fact, interferon has been used for the treatment of HBV for decades and while it can induce a functional cure, the cure is only seen in a small percentage of patients and the treatment is generally not well tolerated. More targeted immunological approaches are being studied, including agonists of toll-like receptors, modulators of apoptotic signaling, and checkpoint inhibition. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Also, while past attempts at developing successful therapeutic vaccines have been unsuccessful, efforts continue to develop an effective HBV vaccine, using new vaccine technologies. While there are effective antiviral medications prescribed for HBV, they generally have low true cure rates. Many companies are seeking to develop new HBV drugs that alone or in combination with other mechanisms could lead to a functional cure of HBV. Arbutus, Assembly, Gilead, HEC, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Maxwell, Replicor, Roche, Spring Bank and Vir have Phase 2 programs in progress, with many of these companies conducting earlier stage programs as well. In addition, a number of companies have Phase 1 or earlier stage HBV programs, including Aicuris, Aligos, Altimmune, Dicerna, ENYO, Hepion and Transgene.

Our Approach to the Treatment of HBV 
 
We are initially focusing on new core inhibitors that we expect to have an impact on capsid assembly and possibly interfere with other viral processes. Core inhibitors, also known as capsid assembly modulators or core protein allosteric modulators, are a novel class of replication inhibitors that have been shown to act at multiple steps in the HBV lifecycle. These inhibitors would be expected to prevent proper uncoating, nuclear import, assembly, and recycling. This approach is supported by early clinical validation, with the core inhibitor NVR 3-778 from Novira, JNJ-56136379 from Janssen, and ABI-H0731 from Assembly, demonstrating clinical reduction of viral DNA in chronic HBV patients in short-term Phase 1b or Phase 2 clinical studies. 
 In 2019, we identified our first core inhibitor candidate, EDP-514, for which we initiated a Phase 1a/1b study in mid-2019. In addition, we are conducting preclinical experiments with other mechanisms that target HBV. Due to the complex nature of HBV infection, it is widely believed that combination therapy may be necessary to provide the optimal therapeutic approach for this disease. 
 Our Out-Licensed HCV Protease Inhibitor Products
 Background and Overview of HCV Market 
 HCV is a virus that is a common cause of viral hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver. HCV is typically contracted by contact with the blood or other body fluids of another individual infected with HCV. HCV is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, liver failure and cancer, and the leading cause of death from liver disease in the United States. HCV disease progression occurs over a period of 20 to 30 years, with the majority of HCV-infected individuals generally exhibiting no major symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Therefore, until a major symptom is diagnosed, many individuals are unaware they are infected and live undiagnosed without seeking treatment. For that reason, combined with the new availability of effective treatments for HCV, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, issued new guidelines in 2013 recommending screening for all Americans born between the years 1945 and 1965 so that HCV-infected individuals will be aware of their condition and can consider treatment options. 
 An estimated 71 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HCV and have an increased risk of eventually developing liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. Approximately 399,000 people die every year from HCV-related liver diseases. The CDC currently estimates that approximately 2.4 million people in the United States are chronically infected with HCV, with an estimated 44,300 new infections in 2017, the most recent year for which the CDC has published data. We believe that the chronically infected population remains significantly untreated, even with the introduction of several new regimens beginning in 2013. 
The approved treatments for HCV have provided significant benefit to HCV patients. To date, these treatments have cure rates approaching 100% in several subpopulations. Medical practice defines a “cure” as the point at which there is no quantifiable virus in a patient’s blood for a sustained period of time after cessation of therapy, which is often referred to as a sustained virologic response, or SVR. For AbbVie’s MAVYRET/MAVIRET regimen, the majority of chronic HCV patients only require 8 weeks of treatment compared to 12 weeks with other HCV regimens, including Gilead’s EPCLUSA® and HARVONI® in almost all HCV genotypes.
 11


Since the introduction of Gilead’s Harvoni® and AbbVie’s VIEKIRA PAK® in late 2014, the reported worldwide sales of the leading HCV therapies have declined from $23 billion in 2015 to approximately $8 billion in 201. Through the first nine months of calendar 201, reported worldwide net sales were $4.9 billion. HCV sales have declined since their peak in 2015 due to payers obtaining additional discounts, competitive market dynamics and a decline in the number of patients treated annually after the initial wave of diagnosed chronic HCV patients who had urgency for treatment. After the regulatory approvals of MAVYRET and Gilead’s VOSEVI in 2017, Johnson & Johnson and Merck announced they had terminated their development of additional HCV treatments. Despite the high numbers of HCV patients that have been successfully treated, there remains a large population of chronic HCV-infected patients who have yet to be treated with one of the newer “high cure” regimens. In addition, and as noted above, new HCV infections (principally in association with IV drug use) are an ongoing target population for treatment.
 Our Out-Licensed Products in AbbVie’s Marketed Therapies 
 Glecaprevir - Our protease inhibitor, glecaprevir, which is part of the latest HCV regimen from AbbVie, was developed by AbbVie in combination with pibrentasvir, AbbVie’s second NS5A inhibitor.  This co-formulated combination, marketed under the tradenames MAVYRET® (U.S.) and MAVIRET™ (ex-U.S.), contains two novel DAAs that target and inhibit proteins essential for the replication of the hepatitis C virus. MAVYRET/MAVIRET is approved in the U.S., EU, Japan and numerous other countries globally as an 8-week, pan-genotypic, fixed-dose combination treatment, dosed once-daily as three oral tablets, taken with food, for chronic HCV patients without cirrhosis and new to treatment. MAVYRET/MAVIRET is also approved as a treatment for patients with specific treatment challenges, including those GT-1 patients not cured by prior treatment experience with either a protease inhibitor or an NS5A inhibitor (but not both), and in patients with limited treatment options, such as those with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) or those with genotype 3 chronic HCV. MAVYRET/MAVIRET is approved for use in patients across all stages of CKD with any of the major HCV genotypes (GT1-6). The approvals of MAVYRET/MAVIRET are supported by data from nine registrational studies in AbbVie’s clinical development program, which evaluated more than 2,300 patients in 27 countries across all major HCV genotypes (GT1-6) and special populations:
  
• | 8 weeks for treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotics: In November 2016, results from several Phase 3 studies of this combination demonstrated 97.5% of chronic HCV infected patients without cirrhosis and new to treatment across all major genotypes (GT1-6) achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment, referred to as SVR12, with just 8 weeks of MAVYRET/MAVIRET treatment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 8 weeks with chronic kidney disease: Results were also presented from AbbVie’s EXPEDITION-4 study in chronic HCV patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), in which 98% of patients (n=102/104) across all major genotypes (GT1-6) achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks of treatment with MAVYRET/MAVIRET.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 8 weeks for GT-3: Data from AbbVie’s ENDURANCE-3 study were presented at the 2017 ILC, demonstrating that 95% of patients with challenging-to-treat, genotype 3 (GT3) chronic HCV infection, without cirrhosis and new to treatment, achieved SVR12 after 8 weeks of treatment with MAVYRET/MAVIRET.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 8 weeks for compensated cirrhosis: Based on data from AbbVie’s EXPEDITION-8 study, which demonstrated that with 8 weeks of MAVYRET treatment, 100 percent (n=273/273) of genotype 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 patients achieved a sustained virologic response 8 weeks after treatment (SVR8) per protocol analysis. Based on this data and a second cohort of the study in genotype 3 (GT3) chronic HCV-infected patients, MAVYRET is now approved for all genotypes with compensated cirrhosis in the U.S.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Paritaprevir - The first protease inhibitor developed through our collaboration with AbbVie, paritaprevir, is part of AbbVie’s 3-DAA regimen approved for the treatment of genotype 1 and 4 HCV patients. This 3-DAA combination was sold as VIEKIRA PAK® (paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir/dasabuvir) in the U.S. from December 2014 to December 2018, and as VIEKIRAX®+EXVIERA® in most other jurisdictions, for non-cirrhotic patients and those with early stage, or compensated, cirrhosis. These regimens are in the process of being replaced by MAVYRET/MAVIRET in jurisdictions around the world wherever the latter is approved for use.

Collaboration and License Agreement with AbbVie
 We entered into a Collaborative Development and License Agreement with Abbott Laboratories in November 2006 to develop and commercialize HCV NS3 and NS3/4A protease inhibitors. The agreement, which was amended in January and December 2009, was then assigned to AbbVie Inc. on January 1, 2013 in connection with Abbott’s transfer of its research-based pharmaceuticals business to AbbVie. Under the agreement, we have granted AbbVie an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, including a right to grant sublicenses, to specified intellectual property, including several issued U.S. patents, relating to protease inhibitors. We also granted AbbVie access to our drug discovery capabilities in the HCV NS3 and NS3/4A protease inhibitor field. AbbVie granted us a co-exclusive (together with AbbVie), royalty-free, fully paid license, without the right to grant sublicenses, to certain of AbbVie’s intellectual property, AbbVie’s interest in joint intellectual property and improvements discovered by AbbVie, for the purpose of allowing us to conduct certain development and commercialization activities in the United States relating to protease inhibitors. AbbVie is responsible for and has funded all costs associated with the development, manufacturing and commercialization of paritaprevir, glecaprevir and any other compounds under this agreement. Under the agreement, we are eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties with respect to these compounds. So long as a product candidate is being developed or commercialized under the agreement, we undertake not to conduct any activity, or grant licenses to a third party, relating to protease inhibitors. 
 A joint steering committee was established under the agreement with review and oversight responsibilities for all research, development and commercialization activities. The joint steering committee is comprised of three of our senior personnel and three senior personnel from AbbVie; however, AbbVie has final authority to make all decisions regarding development and commercialization activities. 
 The research program and the evaluation period, which was performed by both parties, ended in June 2011. The first commercialized compound was paritaprevir with the second commercialized compound, glecaprevir, approved in 2017 and marketed under the tradenames MAVYRET® (U.S.) or MAVIRET™ (ex-U.S.). Under this collaboration we have received payments from AbbVie for license fees, proceeds from a sale of preferred stock, research funding payments and milestone payments totaling $396.0 million through September 30, 2019. 
 We also receive annually tiered, double-digit royalties per protease inhibitor product developed under the agreement, which range from ten percent up to twenty percent, or on a blended basis from the low double digits up to the high teens. However, if a product is determined to be a combination product, as is the case for both glecaprevir and paritaprevir, the net sales of the combination product are adjusted on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis to reflect a good faith determination of the relative value of each pharmaceutically active ingredient, based on the estimated fair market value. This means that a portion of AbbVie’s worldwide annual net sales of a combination product or regimen is first allocated to one of our protease inhibitors and then that royalty-bearing portion is multiplied by the annually tiered royalty rates to determine our actual royalty for the protease product in that regimen in a given period. Under the terms of our agreement, as amended in October 2014, 50% of AbbVie’s net sales of MAVYRET/MAVIRET are allocated to glecaprevir. In the case of regimens containing paritaprevir, 30% of net sales of 3-DAA regimens containing paritaprevir and 45% of net sales of 2-DAA regimens containing paritaprevir are allocated to paritaprevir for purposes of calculating our annually tiered royalties. Beginning with each January 1, the cumulative net sales of a given royalty-bearing protease inhibitor product start at zero for purposes of calculating the tiered royalties on a product-by-product basis. Under this collaboration, we have received royalty payments from AbbVie totaling $475.0 million through September 30, 2019. Further details of these tiered royalties are set forth in Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, which are incorporated herein by this reference.  
 Royalties owed to us under the agreement can be reduced by AbbVie in certain circumstances, including (i) if AbbVie exercises its right to license or otherwise acquire rights to intellectual property controlled by a third party where a product could not be legally developed or commercialized in a country without the third-party intellectual property right, (ii) where a product developed under the collaboration agreement is sold in a country and not covered by a valid patent claim in such country, or (iii) where sales of a generic product are equal to at least a specified percentage of AbbVie’s market share of a product in a country. 
 AbbVie’s obligation to pay royalties on products developed under the agreement expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later of (i) the date of expiration of the last of the licensed patents with a valid claim covering the product in the applicable country, and (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale of the product in the applicable country. 
 13


Our intellectual property existing as of the effective date of the agreement remains our property. Any intellectual property jointly developed is jointly owned. We will have the unilateral right to enforce our patent rights on any covered product following the first commercial sale of such product, as will AbbVie. In the event of infringement related to any of our patents, we will have the first right and option to initiate legal proceedings or take other actions. In the event of infringement related to any AbbVie patents, AbbVie will have the first right and option to initiate legal proceedings or take other actions. In the event of infringement of a joint patent right, we will discuss with AbbVie whether to initiate legal proceedings or take other actions. AbbVie will have the obligation to defend at its sole expense any actions brought against either party alleging infringement of third-party rights by reason of the activities conducted under the agreement and we will have the right to obtain separate counsel at our own expense. Additionally, AbbVie, at its sole expense, will be responsible for all trademark prosecution. 
 Subject to the exceptions described above, a party’s rights and obligations under the agreement continue until: (i) such time as AbbVie is no longer developing a product candidate or (ii) if, as of the time AbbVie is no longer developing any product candidates, AbbVie is commercializing any other protease inhibitor product, such time as all royalty terms for all covered products and all co-development terms for all co-developed products have ended. Accordingly, the final expiration date of the agreement is currently indeterminable. 
 Either party may terminate the agreement for cause in the event of a material breach, subject to prior notice and the opportunity to cure, or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy. Additionally, AbbVie may terminate the agreement for any reason upon specified prior notice. 
 If we terminate the agreement for cause or AbbVie terminates without cause, any licenses and other rights granted to AbbVie will terminate and AbbVie will be deemed to have granted us (i) a non-exclusive, perpetual, fully paid, worldwide, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, under AbbVie’s intellectual property used in any product candidate and (ii) an exclusive (even as to AbbVie), perpetual, fully paid, worldwide, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, under AbbVie’s interest in joint intellectual property rights to develop product candidates resulting from covered compounds and to commercialize any products derived from such compounds. Upon our request, AbbVie will also transfer to us all right, title and interest in any related product trademarks, regulatory filings and clinical trials. 
 If AbbVie terminates the agreement for our uncured breach, the royalty payments payable by AbbVie may be reduced, the licenses granted to AbbVie will remain in place, we will be deemed to have granted AbbVie an exclusive license under our interest in joint intellectual property, AbbVie will continue to have the right to commercialize any covered products, and all rights and licenses granted to us by AbbVie will terminate. 
 Drug Discovery 
 We have internally discovered all of the compounds in our research and development programs. Our scientists have expertise in the areas of medicinal chemistry, molecular virology, pharmacology, and toxicology with highly developed sets of skills in compound generation, target selection, screening and pharmacology, preclinical development and lead optimization. We are utilizing these skills and capabilities in our discovery and development of virology and liver disease product candidates. 
 We focus on virology and liver disease indications representing large and growing market opportunities with significant unmet medical needs. Our selection of a particular therapeutic target within those disease indications takes into consideration the experience and expertise of our scientific team and includes our ability to generate robust medicinal chemistry structure-activity relationships to assist lead optimization and secure relevant intellectual property rights. Once we have identified lead compounds, they are tested using in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies and in vivo research models of antiviral or antibacterial efficacy. 
 Competition
 We are engaged in segments of the pharmaceutical industry that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are commercializing or pursuing the development of products that target HCV, NASH, PBC, RSV and HBV and other viral infections or liver diseases that we may target in the future.
 Many of our competitors have substantially greater commercial infrastructures and financial, technical and personnel resources than we have, as well as drug candidates in late-stage clinical development. We will not be able to compete successfully unless we are able to: 
 14


 
• | design and develop products that are superior to other products in the market;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | attract qualified scientific, medical, regulatory, sales and marketing and commercial personnel;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our processes and product candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain required regulatory approvals; or
--+-----------------------------------------


• | collaborate with others in the development and commercialization of new products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Established competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop novel compounds that could make our product candidates obsolete. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety, or some combination of these factors, to overcome competition and to be commercially successful. 
 We expect AbbVie’s MAVYRET/MAVIRET to continue to face intense competition due to existing approved products in the HCV market. AbbVie’s HCV treatment regimens currently face competition in various world markets and subpopulations of HCV from Gilead’s Epclusa® (a fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir), Vosevi™ (a triple combination therapy of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir approved by the FDA in July 2017 for specified sofosbuvir -treatment failures and NS5A-inhibitor treatment failures) and Harvoni® (a fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir); and to a lesser extent - Merck’s Zepatier® (a fixed-dose combination of grazoprevir and elbasvir). Gilead launched its own authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in January 2019 through a newly created subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics, LLC, to be more competitive with MAVYRET/MAVIRET in managed Medicaid and Medicare Part D accounts. Then in March 2019, the state of Louisiana announced the selection of Asegua Therapeutics as their HCV subscription model pharmaceutical partner to reflect more closely the discounts that health insurers and government payers receive for the branded versions of Epclusa and Harvoni and to provide the state with unrestricted access to its direct-acting antiviral medication. Other competitive products in the form of other treatment methods or a vaccine for HCV may render AbbVie’s HCV regimens obsolete or noncompetitive. AbbVie’s regimens that contain one of our collaboration’s protease inhibitors will face competition based on their safety and effectiveness, reimbursement coverage, price, patent position, AbbVie’s marketing and sales capabilities, and other factors.
 Competitive products in the form of other treatment methods or a vaccine for HCV may render AbbVie’s MAVYRET/MAVIRET obsolete or noncompetitive. This regimen will continue to face competition based on its price, reimbursement coverage, AbbVie’s marketing and sales capabilities, patent position, safety and effectiveness, and other factors. If any of AbbVie’s HCV regimens face competition from generic products other than authorized generic versions by the manufacturer of the branded product (i.e. Gilead and Asegua Therapeutics), the collaboration agreement provides that the royalty rate applicable to our protease product contained in the regimen is reduced significantly by a specified percentage on a product-by-product, country-by-country basis. If AbbVie is not able to compete effectively against its competitors in HCV, our business will not grow and our financial condition, operations and stock price will suffer.
 We also expect our other product candidates to face intense and increasing competition in the NASH and antiviral markets as advanced technologies and products become available. Though there is currently no approved treatment for NASH, we expect significant competition from other companies in the development of new treatments for NASH and related conditions. Intercept Pharmaceuticals has completed a Phase 3 trial of OCALIVA® in NASH and has submitted regulatory filings in the U.S. for approval of OCA in NASH and plans to submit European regulatory filings in calendar Q4 2019. We are aware of several other companies with NASH programs that are significantly more advanced than ours, including companies with compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials in NASH, namely Allergan, Galmed, Genfit and Madrigal. In addition, a number of companies have NASH or related programs with compounds in Phase 2 clinical trials. These companies include Akero, Alberio, Astra-Zeneca, BMS, Boehringer Ingelheim, Can-Fite BioPharma, Cirius, Cymabay, Galectin, Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline, Immuron, Inventiva, Ionis, Lipocine, Medicinova, Metacrine, Northsea Therapeutics, Novartis, NGM, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Poxel, Second Genome, Viking and Zydus. For PBC, in May 2016, the FDA granted conditional approval for Intercept’s FXR agonist, OCA for the treatment of PBC in combination with first line therapy ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. In addition, several other companies are conducting advanced trials in PBC, including Cymabay (Phase 3) and Genfit (Phase 2 completed). A significant number of other companies are conducting earlier stage clinical trials that may be 
 15


applicable in NASH, PBC and other cholestatic diseases. There are also additional companies conducting preclinical studies in these disease areas.
Similarly, HBV and RSV represent competitive therapeutic areas. While there are effective antiviral medications prescribed for HBV, they generally have low true cure rates. Many companies are seeking to develop new HBV drugs that alone or in combination with other mechanisms could lead to a functional cure of HBV. Arbutus, Assembly, Gilead, HEC, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Maxwell, Replicor, Roche, Spring Bank and Vir have Phase 2 programs in progress, with many of these companies conducting earlier stage programs as well. In addition, a number of companies have Phase 1 or earlier stage HBV programs, including Aicuris, Aligos, Altimmune, Dicerna, ENYO, Hepion and Transgene. 
 For RSV, there are currently no safe and effective therapies for already established RSV infection. Several companies are seeking new antiviral treatments for RSV infection in adult and pediatric patients. Ark Biosciences, Johnson & Johnson, and ReViral each have compounds in clinical development. A prophylactic, monoclonal-antibody-based treatment from MedImmune, which is commercialized by AbbVie outside of the U.S., is approved for infants considered at high risk for RSV infection; however studies have found that most young children with RSV infection were previously healthy, and thus would not normally be prescribed prophylactic treatment. In addition, a number of companies have RSV vaccines in development, primarily directed at prevention of RSV infection, and some companies are also evaluating vaccines in a therapeutic mode for treatment of established RSV infection.
If we are not able to develop new products that can compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition, operations and stock price will suffer.
 Intellectual Property 
 As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection for our product candidates in the United States and certain major foreign jurisdictions and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements to our compounds. We also rely on trade secrets, internal know-how, technological innovations and agreements with third parties to develop, maintain and protect our competitive position. Our ability to be competitive will depend on the success of this strategy. 
 Each of our major programs, including RSV, NASH, PBC, HBV and HCV, typically has several issued patents and pending patent claims in the program area containing claims to compounds, methods of use and processes for synthesis. However, only a few of the issued patents and/or pending patent applications cover the lead product candidate in a given program. 
 RSV, NASH, PBC and HBV Programs. Our patent portfolio directed to N-and L-protein inhibitors for RSV, FXR agonists and ASK-1 inhibitors for NASH, PBC and fibrosis, and core inhibitors for HBV includes pending U.S. patent applications as well as numerous foreign patent applications. 
 HCV NS3 Protease Inhibitor Program. The patent portfolio directed to the HCV protease inhibitor program with AbbVie includes U.S. patents and foreign patents, as well as non-provisional applications. The issued U.S. composition-of-matter patent covering paritaprevir is expected to expire in 2031. The issued U.S. composition-of-matter patent covering glecaprevir is expected to expire in 2032. AbbVie is a joint owner of a number of the non-provisional patent applications. AbbVie also has rights to some or all of these patents and patent applications pursuant to its collaboration agreement with us.
 We may obtain patents for certain compounds many years before we obtain marketing approval for products containing such compounds. Because patents have a limited life, which usually begins to run well before the first commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to apply for patent term extensions in the United States and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval, but we cannot be certain we will obtain such extensions. 
 It is also very important that we do not infringe patents or other proprietary rights of others. If we do infringe such patents or other proprietary rights, we could be prevented from developing or selling products or from using the processes covered by those patents, could be required to pay substantial damages, or could be required to obtain a license from the third party to allow us to use their technology, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we were not able to obtain a required license or develop alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products, and our business could be adversely affected. 
 16


In addition, we jointly own patent applications, together with AbbVie, that claim paritaprevir and glecaprevir as a chemical entity. However, there is no guarantee that such applications will issue. Further, the existence of issued patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have already or could obtain rights to patents that could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates. If these other parties are successful in obtaining valid and enforceable patents, and establishing our infringement of those patents, we could be prevented from commercializing our product candidates unless we were able to obtain a license under such patents, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 Much of our scientific capabilities depend upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel. To protect our rights to our proprietary know-how and technology, we endeavor to require all employees, as well as our consultants and advisors, when feasible, to enter into confidentiality agreements that require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants and advisors in the course of their service to us. 
 We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and we may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights.” 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we develop. Any pharmaceutical candidate that we develop must be approved by the FDA before it may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before it may be legally marketed in foreign countries. 
United States Drug Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practice, or GLPs, or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s current Good Clinical Practice, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or an NDA, for a new drug product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is to be produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice standards, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17


 
• | Potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 The lengthy process of seeking required approvals, which can often take anywhere from six months from the time the NDA is filed if there is a priority review for a breakthrough therapy to twelve months for a standard review, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources. There can be no certainty that approvals will be granted. 
 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with GLP and other federal regulations and requirements. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot assure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that result in suspension or termination of such trial. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients having the disease being studied under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. 
 Human clinical trials prior to approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy humans and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted only in patients having the specific disease.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule for patients having the specific disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials, which usually involve more patients than earlier trials, are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA by the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or 
 18


any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human patients. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board, may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must include methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees by the applicant; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. 
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has twelve months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs. 
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. In addition to its own review, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is to be manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. 
 The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA will issue a “complete response” 
 19


letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has four programs intended to expedite the development and review of new drugs addressing unmet medical needs or treating serious or life-threatening conditions: fast track, breakthrough therapy, priority review, and accelerated approval. 
 The FDA “fast track” program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and address unmet medical needs. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Under the fast track program, the sponsor will have more frequent interactions with the FDA during drug development, and may also submit sections of the NDA on a rolling basis to the FDA for review before submitting the complete application. Fast track does not guarantee that a product will be reviewed more quickly or receive FDA approval. 
 The FDA “breakthrough therapy” program is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. Preliminary clinical evidence must show that the drug may have substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Although the drug does not have to address an unmet medical need, designation of breakthrough therapy status carries all the “fast track” program features. Additionally, the breakthrough therapy program entitles the sponsor to earlier and more frequent interaction with the FDA review team regarding development of nonclinical and clinical data, and allows the FDA to offer product development and regulatory advice necessary to shorten the time for product approval. The breakthrough therapy status does not guarantee a quicker development or review of the product, and does not ensure FDA approval. 
 The FDA also has a “priority review” program for products offering significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. The goal of the priority review program is to shorten the review period to six months from the ten months required for standard review. Any drug with breakthrough therapy, accelerated approval designation, or fast track can be granted priority review if it meets the necessary criteria. 
 The FDA “accelerated approval” program is intended to expedite the development and review of products with the potential to treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. The program allows approval of a product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of the product perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to establish safety and efficacy for the approved indication. Failure to conduct such studies or failure of the studies to establish required safety and efficacy may result in revocation of approval. The FDA also requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch or subsequent marketing of the product. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. Certain requirements include, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information on an annual basis or more frequently for specific events, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and 
 20


signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising requirements include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), rules for conducting industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including the immediate discontinuation of noncomplying materials, adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. 
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Manufacturers of our product candidates are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. These regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of comprehensive records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are also required to register their establishments and list any products they make with the FDA and to comply with related requirements in certain states. These entities are further subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in serious and extensive restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA. These restrictions may include suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a “consent decree,” which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, as well as risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could otherwise restrict the distribution or use of the product. 
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during federal regulatory review preceding the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted within 60 days of approval, prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. However, there is no guarantee that any such application will be approved. 
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA, which are independent of patent status and any patent related extensions, can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA. If the new drug is a new chemical entity subject to an NDA, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously 
 21


approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or functional group of a molecule responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a so-called Section 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, state attorney generals and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the Veterans Health Care Act, or VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain pharmaceutical products at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and United States Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service—designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicare and Medicaid. Recent legislative changes purport to require that discounted prices be offered for certain United States Department of Defense purchases for its TRICARE program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. 
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a 
 22


clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trials may proceed. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) / WHO Good Clinical Practice standards and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA. The application used to file an NDA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 In 2003, the United States government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Federal, state and local governments in the United States continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates that we are developing. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry.

The comprehensive overhaul extended coverage to approximately 20 million previously uninsured Americans. Since its adoption, the ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse, which have affected existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act, as limited by the United States Supreme Court’s decision in June 2012: 
  
• | increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D, beginning January 2011; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs.

 More recently, President Trump and the Republicans in both houses of the U.S. Congress have been seeking to repeal or replace all or portions of the ACA but to date they have been unable to agree on any such legislation. On December 14, 2018, a United States District Court judge in Texas ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While this U.S. District Court judge, as well as the Trump administration and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA. We cannot predict what legislation, if any, to repeal or replace the ACA will become law, or what impact any such legislation, or the Texas court challenge, may have on our product candidates or on AbbVie’s sales of MAVYRET/MAVIRET. 
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 The marketability of any drug candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical drug pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Research and Development
 Our research and development expenses were $142.2 million, $94.9 million and $57.5 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
 Manufacturing 
 We do not have our own manufacturing capabilities, except with respect to limited amounts of active pharmaceutical ingredients needed for preclinical development. To date, we have relied on third-party manufacturers, including manufacturers in China, for supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients and ingredients for use in clinical trials of our product candidates. We also expect that in the future we will rely on such manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of any product candidates that we commercialize ourselves. Manufacturing for paritaprevir and

glecaprevir are conducted by AbbVie. Wherever possible, we seek to identify multiple suppliers for raw materials and key intermediaries to be used in our manufacturing process.
Sales and Marketing 
 We currently do not have any commercialization or sales and marketing capabilities, and currently have no fixed plans to invest in or build such capabilities internally. We have partnered our protease inhibitor compounds for HCV with AbbVie. We may also partner or collaborate with, or license commercial rights to, other larger pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies to support the development of one or more of our wholly-owned product candidates through late-stage clinical development and, if successful, commercialization. However, we still retain all commercial rights to our independent programs and we will continue to evaluate our alternatives for commercializing them once they are more advanced in their clinical development.
