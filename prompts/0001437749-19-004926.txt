ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
We are a leading provider of digital marketing software for search, social, eCommerce and display advertising channels, offered as a unified software-as-a-service, or SaaS, advertising management platform for performance-driven advertisers and agencies. Our platform is an analytics, workflow and optimization solution for marketing professionals, allowing them to effectively manage their digital advertising spend. We market and sell our solutions to advertisers directly and through leading advertising agencies, and our customers collectively manage billions of dollars in advertising spend on our platform globally across a wide range of industries. We believe this makes us one of the largest providers of independent advertising cloud solutions. Our software solution is designed to help our customers:
 

● | measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns through our proprietary reporting and analytics capabilities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | manage and execute campaigns through our intuitive user interface and underlying technology that streamlines and automates key functions, such as advertisement creation and bidding, across multiple publishers and channels; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | optimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels based on market and business data to achieve desired revenue outcomes using our predictive bid management technology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Advertisers use our platform to create, target and convert precise audiences based on recent buying signals from users’ search, social, eCommerce and display interactions. Our platform is integrated with leading publishers such as Amazon, Baidu, Bing, Facebook, Google, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Verizon Media, Yahoo! Japan and Yandex. Additionally, we have integrations with more than 50 leading web analytics and advertisement-serving solutions and key enterprise applications, enabling our customers to more accurately measure the return on investment of their marketing programs.
 
Our software platform serves as an integration point for advertising performance, sales and revenue data, allowing advertisers to connect the dots between advertising spend and revenue outcomes. Through an intuitive interface, we enable our customers to simultaneously run large-scale digital advertising campaigns across multiple publishers and channels, making it easy for marketers to create, publish, modify and optimize campaigns.
 
Our predictive bid management and optimization technology also allows advertisers to forecast outcomes and optimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels to achieve their business goals. Our optimization technology can help advertisers increase advertisement spend on those campaigns, publishers and channels that are performing well while reducing investment in those that are not. This category of solutions, which we refer to as cross-channel bid and campaign optimization, helps businesses intelligently and efficiently measure, manage, and optimize their digital advertising spend to achieve desired business results.

Display – Perfect Audience
 
Targeting small businesses, Perfect Audience, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is designed for rapid deployment and offers customers an easy-to-use interface to implement and optimize campaigns across all major networks and across devices.
Technology & Supporting Platform
 
We designed our cloud-based platform to support large global advertisers. The majority of our software is written in Java. Our hardware consists of industry-standard servers and network infrastructure. Our standard operating system is Linux. Our software platform is character-set, language, currency, and time-zone independent. Our technology platform has the following key benefits:

● | Scalability. Our platform is designed to handle billions of advertising units across thousands of advertisers, while delivering a responsive browsing and editing experience. If the number of advertisers and resulting computing and storage requirements changes, we can add or remove hardware to our platform to accommodate the demand.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Availability. Our customers are highly dependent on the availability of our platform, which is designed to be available 24x7, 365 days a year. We operate our own hardware and use third-party data centers that offer server redundancy, back-up communications and power and physical security.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Security. Our platform manages a large quantity of customer data. We employ technologies, policies and procedures to protect customer data. Our primary third-party data center has SOC 1 attestations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are continuously upgrading our software platform in a manner that we believe will cost-effectively extend the scalability, speed, resiliency and availability of our services and facilitate our ability to add new features to our products.
 
Strategic Agreements
 
We have entered into long-term strategic agreements with certain leading search publishers. Under these strategic agreements, we receive consideration based on a percentage of the search advertising spend that our customers manage on our platform.
 
In December 2018, we entered into such an agreement with Google, under which we receive revenue share payments based on our customers' search advertising spend on Google and certain other eligible search engines. In exchange, we will reinvest a percentage of these revenue share payments to drive our technology platform innovation. This agreement went into effect on October 1, 2018, and is scheduled to terminate on September 30, 2021, although Google may terminate the agreement on September 30, 2020 if we do not meet certain financial metrics for the three month period preceding that date. This agreement and the related revenue recognition considerations are described more fully in Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
Customers
 
We market and sell our technology solutions to advertisers directly and through advertising agencies that use our platform on behalf of their customers. Advertisers that we serve through our relationships with agencies have historically represented between approximately one-third to one-half our overall revenues. We also generate revenues from leading publishers through our long-term strategic agreements.
Competition
 
The digital advertising cloud market is highly competitive, fragmented, and subject to changes in both technology and customer behavior. We face significant competition today and expect competition to intensify in the future. To maintain and improve our competitive position, we must keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers and continue to develop and introduce new modules, features and services in a timely and efficient manner. We currently compete with large, well-established companies, such as Adobe Systems Incorporated, Facebook, Inc., Google Inc. (through its wholly owned subsidiary DoubleClick) and Kenshoo Ltd. We also compete with in-house proprietary tools, tools from publishers and custom solutions, including spreadsheets. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

● | solution quality, breadth, stability, flexibility and functionality;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | tangible platform benefits;
--+----------------------------


● | level of customer satisfaction and our ability to respond to customer needs rapidly;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | breadth and quality of advertiser and agency relationships;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | ability to innovate and develop new or improved products and features while maintaining platform speed and stability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ability to respond to changes in publishers’ APIs;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | brand awareness and reputation; and
--+------------------------------------


● | size of customer base.
--+-----------------------

 
Apart from cross-channel platform competitors, we also compete with channel solutions in the display and social advertising markets. Competitors in the display advertising market include companies such as AdRoll Inc., Criteo S.A. , MediaMath, Inc. and Sizmek, Inc., while in the social advertising market we compete with public companies such as 4C Insights, Inc., Nanigans, Inc., Salesforce.com (through its wholly owned subsidiary Social.com) and Smartly.io Inc.
 
Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance in the areas of the quality, functionality and breadth of our solution and the availability and knowledgeability of our customer support.

Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our solutions directly to advertisers and to agencies in a wide range of industries through our global sales team. Our sales cycle can vary substantially by advertiser and agency, but can take up to nine months. We have a number of account executive sales teams organized by geography and market segments. We also have customer success professionals who are responsible for long-term customer satisfaction and retention, renewal, support and driving an increase in the volume of media managed by customers on our platform.
 
Our marketing team is focused on driving awareness and demand generation across major markets. This team provides thought leadership in the form of white papers, benchmarking reports, bylines, presenting at industry conferences and speaking to the press. In addition, they are responsible for the creation of field enablement assets such as case studies, blog posts and corporate and product collateral.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of our platform. Our research and development process emphasizes frequent, iterative and incremental development cycles. Within our research and development organizations, we have several project teams that focus on platform and feature development for our advertising cloud solutions. Each of these project teams includes engineers, quality engineers and product managers, as needed, responsible for the initial and ongoing development for their projects.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business in the advertising and SaaS industries and on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. The manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the SaaS and advertising industries and the Internet in general and how they will relate to our business in particular, are often unclear. For example, we often cannot be certain how existing laws will apply in the eCommerce and online context, including with respect to such topics as privacy, advertising, pricing, taxation, content regulation, quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
 
Numerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States, and in some cases internationally, that have a direct impact on our business and operations. For example, in 2016 the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, a new regulation governing data privacy, which became effective in May 2018 and replaced the Data Protection Directive. The GDPR establishes new requirements applicable to the handling of personal data and imposes penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of €20,000,000 or 4% of worldwide revenue. Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which goes into effect on January 1, 2020, provides consumers the right to know what personal data companies collect, how it is used, and the right to access, delete and opt of sale of their personal information to third parties. It also expands the definition of personal information and gives consumers increased privacy rights and protections for that information.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 292 full-time and part-time employees.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property rights are a key component of our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had three issued patents and six patent applications (one of which is allowed) pending in the United States. We own and use trademarks on or in connection with our products and services, including two registered trademarks in the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, China, Japan and Russia, one registered mark in South Korea and Singapore, and unregistered common law marks and pending trademark applications in the United States, Canada and the European Union. We have also registered numerous Internet domain names.
