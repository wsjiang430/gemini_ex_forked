BUSINESS

General Business and Products Description

International Isotopes Inc. (the Company, we, us and our) manufactures a full range of nuclear medicine calibration and reference standards, a wide range of products, including cobalt teletherapy sources, and a varied selection of radioisotopes and radiochemicals for medical research, pharmacy compounding, and clinical applications. We also provide a host of transportation, recycling, and processing services on a contract basis for customers.

We were formed as a Texas corporation in 1995. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries are International Isotopes Idaho Inc., a Texas corporation; International Isotopes Fluorine Products, Inc., an Idaho corporation; and International Isotopes Transportation Services, Inc., an Idaho corporation. Our core business consists of five reportable segments which include: Nuclear Medicine Standards, Cobalt Products, Radiochemical Products, Fluorine Products, and Radiological Services.

During 2018, we focused our efforts on achieving profitability in each of our core business segments and reached several significant goals. During 2018, we:

·
 Increased revenue by approximately 40% and reduced our net loss by approximately 78%;

·
 Pursued and were awarded numerous field service jobs through the Department of Energys (DOE) Orphan Source Recovery Program (OSRP) and other domestic programs using our mobile hot cell and highly experienced personnel and increased revenue in the Radiological Services segment by approximately 67%;

·
 Contracted with an alternate supplier of cobalt-60 to fulfill cobalt contract obligations and meet customer demand for various types of sealed source products, which increased our revenue in the Cobalt Products segment by approximately 302%;

·
 Expanded sales of our nuclear medicine products through exercising our management opportunity with RadQual, LLC (RadQual). In particular, we increased our international sales by utilizing the marketing and distribution expertise of our joint venture with RadQual, TI Services, LLC (TI Services);

·
 Supported the review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of our abbreviated new drug application (aNDA) which was submitted to the FDA with a request for expedited review; and

·
 Maintained our relationships in Lea County, New Mexico (location of our proposed de-conversion facility) and continued to pursue opportunities to obtain additional contracts for depleted uranium de-conversion services related to our proposed de-conversion project.

1

In 2019, we plan to continue efforts to further expand and improve upon our operations in our core business segments. We intend to continue to invest in these segments and work to pursue product development, reduce production costs and expand sales in each of them. The following paragraphs provide a brief description of each of our business segments. Certain financial information with respect to each of our business segments, including revenues from external customers, a measure of profit or loss, and total assets, is set forth in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements which begin on page F-7.

Nuclear Medicine Standards

This segment consists of the manufacture of sources and standards associated with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging, patient positioning, and calibration or operational testing of dose measuring equipment for the nuclear pharmacy industry. Our nuclear medicine standards products include flood sources, dose calibrators, rod sources, flexible and rigid rulers, spot markers, pen point markers, and a host of specialty design items. These products are manufactured through an exclusive manufacturing agreement with RadQual, of which we own a 24.5% interest. In August 2017, affiliates of the Company purchased the remaining 75.5% interest of RadQual and at that time we were named as one of two managing members of RadQual. As a result of this ownership change, we gained significant influence in management decisions with regard to RadQuals business operations. We have a manufacturing agreement with RadQual, that will remain in place and provides that we will manufacture sources exclusively for RadQual and will not manufacture products that would directly compete with RadQual sources.

There are over 5,000 nuclear medicine centers in the United States (U.S.) that require nuclear medicine products on a regular repeat basis. We have been manufacturing these products for RadQual since 2001. The majority of nuclear medicine product sales are to U.S. customers; however, in recent years, as a result of stronger marketing efforts, we have seen an increase in foreign sales, as shown in Note 14 to the accompanying audited financial statements. All of these products contain radioactive isotopes that decay at a predictable rate. Therefore, customers are required to periodically replace most of these products when they reach the end of their useful lives. The useful life of these products varies depending on the isotope used in manufacture, but in most cases averages eighteen months to two years. The isotopes used in manufacturing these nuclear medicine products are available from various sources world-wide and we are not dependent on a single supplier. In addition to the products themselves, we have developed a complete line of specialty packaging for the safe transportation and handling of these products.

RadQual has numerous distributors for direct sales of its products. Formerly, the largest distributor was Technology Imaging Services Inc. (TIS). In December 2010, we formed a 50/50 joint venture with RadQual to acquire the assets of TIS, and those assets were used to create TI Services LLC. This joint venture has provided sales opportunities in existing and future RadQual product lines both domestically and internationally as a marketer for RadQual products. 

Cobalt Products

Our cobalt products segment includes the production of bulk cobalt (cobalt-60), fabrication of cobalt capsules for radiation therapy as well as various industrial applications, and recycling of expended cobalt sources.

Although bulk cobalt sales have historically accounted for a significant amount of the total revenue from this business segment, during the past several years we have not had any bulk sales because of an interruption in cobalt production in the DOEs Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) located in Idaho. Through continued work with the DOE, a new cobalt target was designed and in October 2014 we entered into a ten-year agreement with the DOE for the irradiation of the new target design. We had expected our supply of cobalt material from the ATR to resume in 2018. However, due to extended reactor shut-downs during the year, we now expect our supply of cobalt material from the ATR to resume by the third quarter of 2019. Subsequent to completing the agreement with the DOE, we entered into contracts with several customers for the sale of this material. In accordance with those agreements, we began receiving pre-payments from customers on future cobalt shipments which we recorded as unearned revenue. To fulfill our supply agreements with these customers, we were able to identify a secondary supplier of cobalt to satisfy the terms of our supply agreements. Accordingly, at the time of shipment, customer payments previously recorded as deferred revenue were reclassified as revenue.

The year-over-year demand for cobalt products has remained strong as a result of the introduction of several new types of cobalt therapy units and we have continued to see demand for cobalt-manufactured products for those devices. We have explored and intend to continue to explore, opportunities to further develop cobalt products and sales on an on-going basis. The production, use, transport, and import/export of these products are all heavily regulated, but we have developed an experienced staff of technicians, drivers, and supervisors as part of our efforts to comply with the regulations as well as support cost effective and timely delivery of these products.

At the present time, we are the sole producer of high activity cobalt from any of the DOE reactors in the U.S. There are a few other cobalt source manufacturers in North America, but we believe both our product and service provide us with a competitive edge in competing with these other manufacturers.

2

We also own older cobalt targets stored at the ATR that hold significant market value to us assuming the material is recoverable. Through working with the DOE, we have determined a feasible and cost-effective method of transfer and shipping for these targets and hope to begin shipping them to our facility in third quarter 2019. We will re-evaluate the market value of all remaining older material at the end of 2019.

Radiochemical Products

This segment includes the production and distribution of various isotopically pure radiochemicals for medical, industrial, and research applications. These products are either directly produced by us or are purchased in bulk from other producers and distributed by us in customized packages and chemical forms tailored to meet customer and market demands. Sodium Iodide (Iodine-131) radiochemical product accounts for the largest portion of sales within this segment. Our generic sodium iodide drug product will be the only generic product of this type manufactured in North America and we believe the product will offer customers an attractive alternative to the single existing commercial drug product being sold in the U.S. We have several suppliers of sodium iodide from whom we purchased material during 2018.

Other less significant sales of radiochemical products in this segment consist of sales of isotopes such as Cobalt-57 (Co-57), Cesium-137 (Cs-137), Germanium  68 (Ge-68), Sodium-22 (Na-22), and Barium-133 (Ba-133).

Radiological Services

This segment includes a wide variety of services such as decommissioning disused irradiation units, performing sealed source exchanges in irradiation and therapy units, and processing gemstones.

We are licensed through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to perform certain field service activities in connection with the DOEs Orphan Source Recovery Program (OSRP). These activities include services to support recovery of disused sources under the DOEs OSRP and installation or removal of certain cobalt therapy units. We designed and built a mobile hot cell unit to use in this field service work and during 2018 and 2017 we used the unit extensively to perform numerous OSRP field service jobs. The unique design of our mobile hot cell allows us to modify the hot cells interface with various therapy units or transportation containers in order to perform customized source removal which provides us with a significant competitive advantage over other techniques. Additionally, this unit has allowed us to expand our field service work to include similar international contract opportunities through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As anticipated, this type of field service work generated the majority of revenue within this business segment during 2018 and we expect the same in the coming years.

Fluorine Products and the Planned Uranium De-Conversion Facility

In 2004, we began a major undertaking to construct the first commercial uranium de-conversion facility in the U.S. At that time, we believed that such an undertaking would provide an excellent commercial opportunity to us in the future.

DUF6 is the waste by-product of uranium enrichment and any uranium enrichment facility will create very large quantities of DUF6. Our intended plant design would process DUF6 into DUF4 and then use the DUF4 in the FEP process, thereby, creating a business model in which we would be paid to process the DUF6 and then would be able to sell the fluoride products produced from the DUF4.

We established the fluorine products business segment in 2004 to support production and sale of the gases produced using our Fluorine Extraction Process (FEP) that we intended to use in conjunction with the operation of the proposed depleted uranium de-conversion facility in Lea County, New Mexico. The FEP is a process that produces ultra-high-purity fluoride gas products through a solid-to-solid reaction between depleted uranium tetrafluoride (DUF4) and various solid metal oxides such as silicon. High-purity fluoride gases are in high demand for processes such as ion-implantation and chemical vapor deposition and also for the manufacture of organic complexes used in a host of industrial applications and manufacturing processes.

We acquired seven patents for the FEP in January 2004 and built a pilot production facility in Idaho that began operation in 2006. In 2010, we were granted an additional process patent on FEP based upon information gained through the operation of the pilot facility. Our pilot facility was not used for commercial gas production but instead focused upon production of high-purity products and examined methods of scaling up the size of the production operations in support of the proposed de-conversion facility in New Mexico. By the end of 2012, we had completed our testing of individual components and analytical processes and in April 2013, we shut down the pilot facility and terminated our lease on that property.

In October 2012, we received the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) construction and operating license for the planned de-conversion facility. This is a forty (40) year operating license and is the first commercial license of this type issued in the U.S. There are no other companies with a similar license application under review by the NRC and the license does not require us to begin construction of the project by any specific date. Therefore, the NRC license represents a significant competitive barrier and we believe that it provides us with a very valuable asset now and in the future when we are ready to resume formal design and engineering work on the plant.

3

Due to changes in the nuclear industry near the end of 2013, we placed further engineering work on the proposed uranium de-conversion facility on hold. We still anticipate a potential future need for a depleted uranium conversion facility and, therefore, we are keeping all licenses and permits current.

Further activity within this segment will be deferred until market and industry conditions change and justify resuming design and construction of the facility. In the meantime, we expect to continue to incur some costs associated with the maintenance of licenses, property agreements, and other project investments.

In connection with the proposed de-conversion facility, Lea County, New Mexico transferred property to us under the provisions of the New Mexico Local Economic Development Act, Project Participation Agreement (PPA) as a location for construction of the facility. Under the original agreement, we were obligated to meet certain performance objectives. We did not meet these objectives, however, in July 2015, we executed an amendment to the PPA that extended the due date of the Phase I construction to December 31, 2016, and Phase I completion and hiring at least 75 employees to December 31, 2016. We did not meet the December 31, 2016 deadline and management is working with Lea County to execute an additional modification to the agreement to further extend these dates once an estimated resumption date has been identified. If we do not succeed in extending the commitment dates or in reaching performance dates set forth in a modified agreement then we may either purchase or re-convey the property to Lea County, New Mexico. In addition, if Lea County does not agree to that modification and we do not retain title to the property, it could have a material adverse impact on our planned de-conversion and FEP project since another location would need to be selected and evaluated for environmental compliance. 

Industry Overview, Target Markets, and Competition

The industries and markets that require or involve the use of radioactive material are diverse. Our current core business operations involve products that are used in a wide variety of applications and in various markets. The following provides an explanation of the markets and competitive factors affecting our current business segments.
Nuclear Medicine Standards

Calibration and reference standards are required for the daily operational checks and calibration of the measurement of SPECT imaging devices frequently used in nuclear medicine. Calibration and quality assurance testing are required as a routine part of the normal operations of this equipment to ensure its reliability and accuracy. We exclusively manufacture many of these reference standard products for one customer, RadQual, which in turn has many distributors who make direct sales around the U.S. and internationally. We directly ship these products to all 50 states and many overseas locations. There is only one other producer of these products in the world that directly competes with us for these products. Most of the products manufactured by our competitor are similar in design to our products because all must meet Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) dimensional and performance standards. However, we attempt to differentiate our products from our competitors products through increased levels of quality control and customer service. 
We are certified under ISO-9001:2015 and ISO-13485-2016 quality programs that have allowed us to start selling these products into several foreign countries that require this additional quality certification for manufacturers. We use a small number of suppliers for the isotopes and other materials used in manufacturing these nuclear medicine products, but if we were to lose any of these suppliers, others would be available.
Cobalt Products

Historically, we sold high-activity bulk cobalt to one customer that used it to fabricate several models of sealed sources for medical and industrial applications.  In June 2012, a leak of a cobalt target at the ATR belonging to another commercial business resulted in the curtailment of all further cobalt handling and production activities at the ATR pending completion of several corrective actions. Due to this issue, we were forced to discontinue the irradiation of that cobalt target design. Aside from a few shipments in 2014 and 2016 we have not been able to process this old material. We believe that this older material will be recoverable from the targets and once we are able to ship the material to our facility, we can make this determination. Through collaboration with the DOE, we have determined a viable and cost-effective method of transporting this material to our facility and anticipate shipments to begin about third quarter 2019.

Additionally, we were able to purchase bulk cobalt from another supplier during 2018 and were able to manufacture some sealed source products during 2018. We anticipate that we will continue to use this alternate cobalt supply in 2019.

In 2014, we entered into a new 10-year agreement with the DOE utilizing a new cobalt target design. Because of the lengthy irradiation time required we initially anticipated that cobalt shipments to customers would resume in late 2018. However, due to irradiation delays at the ATR, we now expect those shipments to take place during the third quarter of 2019. Our cobalt products are used in applications such as radiation therapy, security devices, radiography examination and in some commercial applications. While there are other technologies available to provide external radiation therapy, there are several new devices just gaining market approval that still depend on cobalt sources for their specialized applications. There are currently no other producers of high specific activity cobalt in the U.S., however, there is one producer of medium specific activity material and there are at least three significant producers 

4

of high specific activity material in Canada and other parts of the world. In addition to us, there is only one other company in the U.S. currently licensed to handle large quantities of cobalt.

We manufacture cobalt sources as well as recycle used cobalt sources by recovering the cobalt for re-use in the manufacture of new sealed sources for teletherapy devices, irradiators, and other source applications. We are the only company in the U.S. that provides this unique service. There has been a significant increase in regulation by the NRC in recent years that has created a significant barrier to new entrants to this market. We expect steady demand for cobalt sealed source products over the next several years but are currently dependent upon our contract relationship with the DOE for access to its ATR in Idaho for a large portion of our cobalt production activities. The interruption to cobalt production experienced in 2012 had a significant negative impact on our cobalt products business segment, and although we currently have a ten-year irradiation contract in place with the DOE, future interruptions in the operation of the ATR could have a negative impact on our cobalt products business segment. With our new cobalt production contract in place with the DOE we anticipate our market position in this business segment will become stronger in future years.

Radiochemical Products

We typically supply radiochemical products in bulk form. The markets for most radiochemicals are highly competitive. The target markets for these products are customers who (1) incorporate them into finished industrial or medical devices; (2) use radioisotope products in clinical trials for various medical applications; or (3) further process and include the radioisotope products into pharmaceutical products approved by the U.S. FDA for labeled use in therapy or imaging.

We have submitted an aNDA to the FDA for a radiochemical sodium iodide product. The FDA has granted the Companys request for an expedited review of the application which could accelerate the approval of the product. Once approved we anticipate a quick start-up of commercial sales of the drug product which should have a significant positive impact on our revenues. We are also considering other generic drug opportunities and plan to expand the range of products offered within this business segment in the coming years.

Fluorine Products and the Planned Depleted Uranium De-Conversion Facility

Our Fluorine Products segment was developed in conjunction with uranium de-conversion in order to take advantage of the anticipated need for depleted uranium de-conversion services. Our FEP patents provide a unique opportunity to provide certain high-purity fluoride compounds while also offering a for fee de-conversion service to the uranium enrichment industry. During 2013, we curtailed the formal engineering work on the de-conversion facility because of a lack of demand for uranium de-conversion services at that time. However, we believe that in the future there will be a demand for this service to address still growing stockpiles of depleted UF6. When that demand occurs, we believe the ground-work we have completed on the depleted uranium de-conversion and fluorine extraction project should put us in a strong position to take advantage of our position in the industry and should serve to justify the financial investment in this uranium de-conversion project in the future.
Radiological Services

Our radiological services include the support of field services, including therapy unit decommissioning, and gemstone processing.

In the past several years, we have seen increased opportunities for radiological field service activities involving installation or decommissioning of radiation devices in hospitals, research institutions, and various other commercial facilities. In 2012, we obtained our first amendment to our NRC license to permit certain field service activities and since that time radiological field service work has become a significant contributor to revenue within the segment. During 2018 and 2017 we were awarded numerous contracts for field service activities in connection with the DOEs OSRP program as well as contracts through the IAEA. We designed and built a mobile hot cell unit for use in this field service work and in 2014 and 2015 we were granted additional amendments to our NRC license that have allowed us to expand the types of services we can provide. The design of our mobile hot cell allows us to adapt it to work in various source removal situations that would not otherwise be possible. We will continue to use the mobile hot cell to support these expanded services both domestically and internationally. While there are other companies that compete with us for field services work, we believe our mobile hot cell gives us a unique competitive advantage in some of these opportunities. We are under contract for several of these jobs which are scheduled to take place in 2019. We will continue to pursue these field service opportunities in the U.S. and abroad and expect that, in future years, field services will be the major source of revenue within this business segment.

Our transportation services (IITS) was originally formed as a separate business segment to support transportation of our own products and to provide for hire transportation services. Over the years the business activities in this segment were primarily derived from the Companys radiological services and cobalt products business segments. Therefore, beginning in the first period of 2018, we began combining the transportation services financial reporting within the radiological services segment to provide more qualitative reporting. Prior period information has been adjusted for comparative reporting.

Government Regulation

Licensing

We currently operate under two NRC licenses, one for broad scope operations and another for exempt distribution. Our broad scope license covers calibration and reference standard manufacturing and distribution, radioisotope processing and distribution, large scale cobalt processing and recycle operations, radioactive gemstone processing, environmental sample analysis, certain field service activities, and research and development. The exempt distribution license permits the release and distribution of irradiated gemstones to unlicensed entities in the U.S. All of our existing licenses and permits are adequate to allow current business operations. We do not handle special nuclear materials (i.e. nuclear fuels and weapons grade uranium, thorium or plutonium); therefore, our facility is not designated as a nuclear facility that would require additional licensing.

As a condition of our NRC licenses in Idaho, we are required to provide financial assurance for decommissioning activities. We fulfill this license requirement with a surety bond which names the NRC as beneficiary and is supported by a restricted cash account held in trust by a third party. In January 2018, we re-evaluated the financial assurance needed to support decommissioning and increased the bond amount and the restricted cash amount during the first quarter of 2018. Similar financial assurances will be required to fund the decommissioning of the proposed de-conversion facility.

In October 2012, we were granted a 40-year construction and operating license by the NRC for our planned depleted uranium de-conversion and fluorine extraction processing facility (the de-conversion facility). The de-conversion facility is planned to be located in Lea County, New Mexico, and is proposed to initially de-convert up to approximately 11 million pounds of depleted uranium hexafluoride (DUF6) annually into fluoride products and depleted uranium oxides (DUO). Further engineering work on the proposed de-conversion facility was placed on hold in 2013 until additional contracts for utilization could be obtained. There is no specific timeline required by the NRC for the start of construction on this project. The majority of the pre-construction design, licensing and state permitting has already been completed for the project and a ground water permit from the state of New Mexico remains to be obtained before the plant could begin operation.

Regulation of Radioisotope Production Waste

All of our manufacturing processes generate some radioactive waste. We must handle this waste pursuant to the Low Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW) Policy Act (LLRW Act), which requires the safe disposal of mildly radioactive materials. The estimated costs for storage and disposal of these materials have been included in the manufacturing and sales price of our products. However, actual disposal costs are subject to change at the discretion of the disposal site and are ultimately applied at the time of disposal. We have obtained all necessary permits and approvals for the disposal of our waste materials and we do not anticipate any negative changes in capacity or regulatory conditions that would limit or restrict our waste disposal capabilities.

The planned de-conversion facility will produce large quantities of depleted uranium oxide waste. Disposal of depleted uranium waste will be the responsibility of the customers suppling DUF6 to the company for de-conversion. There are proposed changes to some of the regulations for low level radioactive waste disposal that could impact the rules surrounding disposal of large quantities of depleted uranium. The Company will continue to monitor any changes in the regulatory framework that could impact the de-conversion facility project.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission Oversight

We operate under two NRC licenses and are subject to NRC oversight and periodic inspections of our operations.

Other Regulations

We are registered as a medical device manufacturer through the FDA for several of our nuclear medicine reference and calibration standards. We are registered with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for the shipment of radioactive materials. We also have an NRC license for the import and export of radioactive materials. Because of increasing security controls and regulations, it is likely that we may encounter additional regulations affecting transportation, storage, sale, and import/export of radioactive materials.

We are also subject to inspection by the FDA to be in compliance with cGMP for our sodium iodide product and are registered with the FDA as an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient manufacturer and a manufacturing facility. We have submitted an aNDA to the FDA for our sodium iodide product. Once approved, the facility will thereafter be subject to periodic and random inspections by the FDA for the continued manufacture of this drug product.

6

We are subject to government regulation and intervention both in the U.S. and in all foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and operating costs and changes to current regulations with which we must comply can necessitate further capital expenditures and increases in operating costs to enable continued compliance.

Environmental Compliance

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and state statutes such as the Idaho Hazardous Waste Management Act, the LLRW Policy Act, NRC regulations concerning various irradiated, radioactive, and depleted uranium materials, and U.S. DOT regulations concerning shipment of radioactive materials. Certain of these laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred costs of approximately $153,000 and $307,000, respectively, for licensing and monitoring fees. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques, could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Distribution Methods for Products

We sell our products directly to our customers who, in some cases, are both end users and distributors. We use common commercial carriers and our own transportation vehicles and personnel for delivery of our products. For smaller quantities of material, and overnight and next-day delivery, we utilize other commercial carriers. For our products that involve large quantities of radioactive material, most commonly cobalt-60, and that invoke certain special transportation requirements, we use our own specially trained employees.
Dependence on Customers

Historically, we have been dependent on one customer, RadQual, of which we own 24.5%, for a significant amount of our gross revenue. In August 2017, several affiliates of the Company purchased the remaining 75.5% and at that time, we were named as a managing member of RadQual. Our sales to RadQual prior to August 2017 accounted for approximately 17% of our total gross revenue for 2017 and our sales to RadQual for 2018 totaled approximately 24% of our total gross revenue.

Combined sales, on which we are dependent, to our three largest customers, accounted for 46% of our total gross revenues in 2018 and accounted for 31% of our total gross revenues in 2017. We are making efforts to reduce our dependency on a small number of customers by expanding sales in both domestic and foreign markets and through our relationship with our joint venture, TI Services, to expand distribution of our nuclear medicine products. The change in ownership of RadQual and naming us as a managing member of RadQual business operations, has significantly reduced any risk associated with RadQual as a single major customer of ours.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Royalty Agreements

In 2004, we obtained certain patents related to the FEP. In 2010, we were granted an additional process patent on the FEP process and during 2011 we started the process to file for international protections of this patent in South Africa, Russia, and the European Union. During 2012, we were granted additional process patents for the FEP process in the United States. In 2013, the FEP process patent was granted in Russia and in 2014 the FEP process patent was granted in South Africa.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 32 total employees, including 30 full-time employees.
