PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND STRATEGIES
Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls
Products and Services
We have been involved in the chlor alkali industry for more than 120 years and are a major participant in the global chlor alkali industry.  Chlorine, caustic soda and hydrogen are co-produced commercially by the electrolysis of salt.  These co-produced products are produced simultaneously, and in a fixed ratio of 1.0 ton of chlorine to 1.1 tons of caustic soda and 0.03 tons of hydrogen.  The industry refers to this as an Electrochemical Unit or ECU.  With a demonstrated capacity of 5.8 million ECUs as of the end of 2018, we have the largest global chlor alkali capacity, according to data from IHS, Inc. (IHS). IHS is a global information consulting company established in 1959 that provides information to a variety of industries.
Chlorine is used as a raw material in the production of thousands of products, including vinyls, urethanes, epoxy, water treatment chemicals and a variety of other organic and inorganic chemicals.  A significant portion of chlorine production is consumed in the manufacture of ethylene dichloride (EDC) and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), both of which our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment produces. A large portion of our EDC production is utilized in the production of VCM, but we are also one of the largest global participants in merchant EDC sales. EDC and VCM are precursors for polyvinyl chloride (PVC). PVC is a plastic used in applications such as vinyl siding, pipe, pipe fittings and automotive parts.
Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment is one of the largest global marketers of caustic soda, including caustic soda produced by DowDuPont Inc. (DowDuPont) (f/k/a The Dow Chemical Company) in Brazil. The off-take arrangement with DowDuPont in Brazil entitles the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment the right to market and sell the caustic soda produced at DowDuPont’s Aratu, Brazil site. The diversity of caustic soda sourcing allows us to cost effectively supply customers worldwide. Caustic soda has a wide variety of end-use applications, the largest of which includes water treatment, alumina, pulp and paper, urethanes, detergents and soaps and a variety of other organic and inorganic chemicals.

Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment also includes our chlorinated organics business which is the largest global producer of chlorinated organic products that include chloromethanes (methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride) and chloroethenes (perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and vinylidene chloride). Chlorinated organics participates in both the solvent segment, as well as the intermediate segment of the global chlorocarbon industry with a focus on sustainable applications and in applications where we can benefit from our cost advantages. Intermediate products are used as feedstocks in the production of fluoropolymers, fluorocarbon refrigerants and blowing agents, silicones, cellulosics and agricultural chemicals. Solvent products are sold into end uses such as surface preparation, dry cleaning, pharmaceuticals and regeneration of refining catalysts. This business’s unique technology allows us to utilize both hydrochloric acid and chlorinated hydrocarbon byproducts (RCls), produced by our other production processes, as raw materials in an integrated system. These manufacturing facilities also consume chlorine, which generates caustic soda production and sales.
We also manufacture and sell other chlor alkali-related products, including hydrochloric acid, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and potassium hydroxide, which we refer to as co-products. The production of co-products, chlorinated organics and epoxy generally consume chlorine as a raw material creating downstream applications that upgrade the value of chlorine and enable caustic soda production. Our industry leadership in the production of chlorinated organics and epoxy resins, as well as other co-products, offer us nineteen integrated outlets for our captive chlorine. 
The Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment’s products are delivered by pipeline, marine vessel, deep-water and coastal barge, railcar and truck. Our logistics and terminal infrastructure provides us with geographically advantaged storage capacity and provides us with a private fleet of trucks, tankers and trailers that expands our geographic coverage and enhances our service capabilities. At our largest integrated product sites, our deep-water access enables us to reach global markets.
Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment maintains strong relationships with DowDuPont as both a customer and supplier. These relationships are maintained through long-term cost based contracts that provide us with a reliable supply of key raw materials and predictable and consistent demand for our end use products. Key products sold to DowDuPont include chlorine, caustic soda, chlorinated organics and VCM. Key raw materials received from DowDuPont include ethylene and electricity. Ethylene is supplied for the vinyls business under a long-term supply arrangement with DowDuPont whereby we receive ethylene at integrated producer economics. 
Electricity, salt, ethylene and methanol are the major purchased raw materials for our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment.  Electricity is the single largest raw material component in the production of Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls’ products. Approximately 77% of our electricity is generated from natural gas or hydroelectric sources.  Approximately 69% of our salt requirements are met by internal supply. Methanol is primarily sourced domestically and internationally from large producers. The high volume nature of this industry places an emphasis on cost management and we believe that our scale, integration and raw material positions make us one of the low cost producers in the industry.

Epoxy
Products and Services
The Epoxy business was one of the first major manufacturers of epoxy products, and has continued to build on more than half a century of history through product innovation and technical excellence. According to data from IHS, the Epoxy segment is one of the largest fully integrated global producers of epoxy resins, curing agents and intermediates. The Epoxy segment has a favorable manufacturing cost position which is driven by a combination of scale and integration into low cost feedstocks (including chlorine, caustic soda, allylics and aromatics). With its advantaged cost position, the Epoxy segment is among the lowest cost producers in the world. The Epoxy segment produces and sells a full range of epoxy materials, including upstream products such as allyl chloride (Allyl) and epichlorohydrin (EPI), midstream products such as liquid epoxy resins (LER) and solid epoxy resins (SER) and downstream products such as differentiated epoxy resins and additives.
The Epoxy segment serves a diverse array of applications, including wind energy, electrical laminates, marine coatings, consumer goods and composites, as well as numerous applications in civil engineering and protective coatings. The Epoxy segment has important relationships with established customers, some of which span decades. The Epoxy segment’s primary geographies are North America and Western Europe. The segment’s product is delivered primarily by marine vessel, deep-water and coastal barge, railcar and truck.
Allyl is used not only as a feedstock in the production of EPI, but also as a chemical intermediate in multiple industries and applications, including water purification chemicals. EPI is primarily produced as a feedstock for use in the business’s epoxy resins, and also sold to epoxy producers globally who produce their own resins for end use segments such as coatings and adhesives. LER is manufactured in liquid form and cures with the addition of a hardener into a thermoset solid material offering a distinct combination of strength, adhesion and chemical resistance that is well-suited to coatings and composites applications. SER is processed further with bisphenol (BisA) to meet specific end market applications. While LER and SER are sold externally, a significant portion of LER production is further converted into differentiated epoxy resins where value-added modifications produce higher margin resins.
Our Epoxy segment maintains strong relationships with DowDuPont as both a customer and supplier. These relationships are maintained through long-term cost based contracts that provide us with a reliable supply of key raw materials. Key products sold to DowDuPont include aromatics and key raw materials received from DowDuPont include benzene and propylene.
The Epoxy segment’s production economics benefit from its integration into chlor alkali and aromatics which are key inputs in epoxy production. This fully integrated structure provides both access to low cost materials and significant operational flexibility. The Epoxy segment operates an integrated aromatics production chain producing cumene, phenol, acetone and BisA for internal consumption and external sale. The Epoxy segment’s consumption of chlorine enables the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment to generate caustic soda production and sales. Chlorine used in our Epoxy segment is transferred at cost from the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment.

During 2018, we initiated a cost reduction plan which will permanently close the ammunition assembly operations at our Winchester facility in Geelong, Australia.
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
Olin has an international presence, including the geographic regions of Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Approximately 43% of Olin’s 2018 sales were generated outside of the U.S., including 35% of our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2018 segment sales, 68% of our Epoxy 2018 segment sales and 10% of our Winchester 2018 segment sales. See Note 21 “Segment Information” of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, for geographic segment data.  We are incorporating our segment information from that Note into this section of our Form 10-K.
CUSTOMERS AND DISTRIBUTION
Products we sell to industrial or commercial users or distributors for use in the production of other products constitute a major part of our total sales.  We sell some of our products, such as epoxy resins, caustic soda and sporting ammunition, to a large number of users or distributors, while we sell other products, such as chlorine and chlorinated organics, in substantial quantities to a relatively small number of industrial users.  Olin has entered into or has significant relationships with a few customers including DowDuPont, who was our largest customer by revenue in 2018, representing approximately 14% of our total sales. We expect this relationship to continue to be significant to Olin and to represent more than 10% of our annual sales in the future. No other single customer accounted for more than 5% of sales. We discuss the customers for each of our three business segments in more detail above under “Products and Services.”
We market most of our products and services primarily through our sales force and sell directly to various industrial customers, mass merchants, retailers, wholesalers, other distributors and the U.S. Government and its prime contractors.
Sales to all U.S. Government agencies and sales under U.S. Government contracting activities in total accounted for approximately 2% of sales in 2018.  Because we engage in some government contracting activities and make sales to the U.S. Government, we are subject to extensive and complex U.S. Government procurement laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations provide for ongoing government audits and reviews of contract procurement, performance and administration.  
Failure to comply, even inadvertently, with these laws and regulations and with laws governing the export of munitions and other controlled products and commodities could subject us or one or more of our businesses to civil and criminal penalties, and under certain circumstances, suspension and debarment from future government contracts and the exporting of products for a specified period of time.
BACKLOG
The total amount of estimated backlog was approximately $224 million and $174 million as of January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The backlog orders are associated with contractual orders in our Winchester business.  Backlogs in our other businesses are not significant. Backlog is comprised of all open customer orders which have been received, but not yet shipped.  The backlog was estimated based on expected volume to be shipped from firm contractual orders, which are subject to customary terms and conditions, including cancellation and modification provisions. Approximately 59% of contracted backlog as of January 31, 2019 is expected to be fulfilled during 2019, with the remainder expected to be fulfilled during 2020.
COMPETITION
We are in active competition with businesses producing or distributing the same or similar products, as well as, in some instances, with businesses producing or distributing different products designed for the same uses.
Chlor alkali manufacturers in North America, with approximately 17 million tons of chlorine and 18 million tons of caustic soda capacity, accounted for approximately 17% of worldwide chlor alkali production capacity.  In 2018, according to IHS, we have the largest chlor alkali capacity in North America and globally. While the technologies to manufacture and transport chlorine and caustic soda are widely available, the production facilities require large capital investments, and are subject to significant regulatory and permitting requirements. Approximately 76% of the total North American chlor alkali capacity is located in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. There is a worldwide market for caustic soda, which attracts imports and 
9

allows exports depending on market conditions. Other large chlor alkali producers in North America include The Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Oxy) and Westlake Chemical Corporation (Westlake).  
We are also a leading integrated global producer of chlorinated organic products with a strong cost position due to our scale and access to chlor alkali feedstocks. This industry includes large diversified producers such as Oxy, Westlake and Solvay S.A., as well as multiple producers located in China.
We are a major global fully integrated epoxy producer, with access to key low cost feedstocks and a cost advantaged infrastructure. With its advantaged cost position, the Epoxy segment is among the lowest cost producers in the world. The markets in which our Epoxy segment operates are highly competitive and are dependent on significant capital investment, the development of proprietary technology and maintenance of product research and development. Among our competitors are Huntsman Corporation (Huntsman) and Hexion, Inc., as well as multiple producers located in Asia. 
We are among the largest manufacturers in the U.S. of commercial small caliber ammunition based on independent market research sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF).  Formed in 1961, NSSF has a membership of more than 12,000 manufacturers, distributors, firearms retailers, shooting ranges, sportsmen’s organizations and publishers. According to NSSF, our Winchester business, Vista Outdoor Inc. (Vista), and Remington Outdoor Company, Inc. (Remington) are the three largest commercial ammunition manufacturers in the U.S.  The ammunition industry is highly competitive with us, Vista, Remington, numerous smaller domestic manufacturers and foreign producers competing for sales to the commercial ammunition customers.  Many factors influence our ability to compete successfully, including price, delivery, service, performance, product innovation and product recognition and quality, depending on the product involved.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 6,500 employees, with 5,400 working in the U.S. and 1,100 working in foreign countries.  Various labor unions represent a significant number of our hourly-paid employees for collective bargaining purposes.
The following labor contract is scheduled to expire in 2019:

Location | Number of Employees | Expiration Date
McIntosh (Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls) | 197 | April 2019 

While we believe our relations with our employees and their various representatives are generally satisfactory, we cannot assure that we can conclude this labor contract or any other labor agreements without work stoppages and cannot assure that any work stoppages will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES; PATENTS
Our research activities are conducted on a product-group basis at a number of facilities.  Company-sponsored research expenditures were $14.9 million in 2018, $14.5 million in 2017 and $10.9 million in 2016.
We own or license a number of patents, patent applications and trade secrets covering our products and processes.  We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents and licenses are important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, license or group of patents and licenses related to a specific process or product to be of material importance to our total business.
SEASONALITY
Our sales are affected by the cyclicality of the economy and the seasonality of several industries we serve, including building and construction, coatings, infrastructure, electronics, automotive, bleach, refrigerants and ammunition. The seasonality of the ammunition business is typically driven by the U.S. fall hunting season. Our chlor alkali businesses generally experience their highest level of activity during the spring and summer months, particularly when construction, refrigerants, coatings and infrastructure activity is higher. The chlor alkali industry is cyclical, both as a result of changes in demand for each of the co-produced products and as a result of the large increments in which new capacity is added and removed.  Because chlorine and caustic soda are produced in a fixed ratio, the supply of one product can be constrained both by the physical capacity of the production facilities and/or by the ability to sell the co-produced product.  Prices for both products respond rapidly to changes in supply and demand. The cyclicality of the chlor alkali industry has further impacts on 
10

downstream products. We have significant diversification of our chlorine outlets, which allow us to better manage the cyclical nature of the industry.
RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY
Basic raw materials are processed through an integrated manufacturing process to produce a number of products that are sold at various points throughout the process. We purchase a portion of our raw material requirements and also utilize internal resources, co-products and finished goods as raw materials for downstream products. We believe we have reliable sources of supply for our raw materials under normal market conditions. However, we cannot predict the likelihood or impact of any future raw material shortages.
The principal basic raw materials for our production of Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls’ products are electricity, salt, ethylene and methanol.  Electricity is the predominant energy source for our manufacturing facilities.  Approximately 77% of our electricity is generated from natural gas or hydroelectric sources. We have long-term power supply contracts with DowDuPont in addition to utilizing our own power assets, which allow for cost differentiation at specific U.S. manufacturing sites. A portion of our purchases of raw materials, including ethylene, are made under long-term supply agreements, while approximately 69% of the salt used in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment is produced from internal resources. Methanol is primarily sourced domestically and internationally from large producers.
The Epoxy segment’s principal raw materials are chlorine, benzene, propylene and aromatics, which consist of cumene, phenol, acetone and BisA. A portion of our purchases of raw materials, including benzene, propylene and a portion of our aromatics requirements, are made under long-term supply agreements, while a portion of our aromatics requirements are produced from our integrated production chain. Chlorine is predominately sourced from our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment.
Lead, brass and propellant are the principal raw materials used in the Winchester business.  We typically purchase our ammunition cartridge case cups and copper-based strip, and propellants pursuant to multi-year contracts.
We provide additional information with respect to specific raw materials in the tables set forth under “Products and Services.”
ENVIRONMENTAL AND TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROLS
As is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business.
The establishment and implementation of national, state or provincial and local standards to regulate air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world.  Laws providing for regulation of the manufacture, transportation, use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and remediation of contaminated sites have imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry, particularly the chemicals industry.  In addition, implementation of environmental laws has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase operating costs.
We are a party to various government and private environmental actions associated with former waste disposal sites and past manufacturing facilities.  Charges to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were $7.3 million, $10.3 million and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These charges may be material to operating results in future years. These charges do not include insurance recoveries for costs incurred and expensed in prior periods.
In connection with the October 5, 2015 acquisition of DowDuPont’s U.S. Chlor Alkali and Vinyl, Global Chlorinated Organics and Global Epoxy businesses, the prior owner of the businesses retained liabilities relating to releases of hazardous materials and violations of environmental law to the extent arising prior to October 5, 2015.
See our discussion of our environmental matters contained in Item 3—“Legal Proceedings” below, Note 22 “Environmental” of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 and Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
