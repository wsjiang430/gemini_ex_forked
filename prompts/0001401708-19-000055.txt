Item 1. Business
Overview
We develop, manufacture and sell products that unlock scientifically valuable and clinically actionable information from minute amounts of biological material. Our core technology is a unique, proprietary optical barcoding chemistry that enables the labeling and counting of single molecules. This proprietary chemistry may reduce the number of steps required to conduct certain types of scientific experiments and allow for multiple experiments to be conducted at once. As a result, we are able to develop tools that are easier for researchers to use and that may generate faster and more consistent scientific results. 
We use our technology to develop tools for scientific research, primarily in the fields of genomics and proteomics, and also to develop clinical diagnostic tests. We currently have one commercially available product platform, our nCounter Analysis System instruments and related consumables. nCounter can be used to analyze the activity of up to 800 genes in a single experiment. nCounter is also used by clinicians to analyze gene activity relevant for diagnostic applications. Our proprietary nCounter-based Prosigna assay analyzes the activity of 50 genes to assess the risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients previously treated with radiation therapy. As of December 31, 2018, we had an installed base of approximately 730 nCounter systems, which our customers have used to publish more than 2,300 peer-reviewed scientific papers. 
We have discovered other novel applications that utilize our proprietary barcoding chemistry, and we have two new product platforms under development. Following completion of product development, each of these new systems is expected to be commercialized as a new instrument along with associated consumables.
The first new platform, our GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling, or DSP system, is designed to enable the field of spatial genomics. While nCounter and other existing technologies analyze gene activity as a whole throughout the totality of a biological sample, GeoMx DSP is used to analyze specifically selected regions of a biological sample in order to see how gene activity or protein levels might vary across those regions or in certain cell types. In advance of the launch of the commercial version of GeoMx DSP, we have provided early access to the system’s capabilities by offering selected customers the opportunity to send biological samples to our Seattle facility to be tested by us on prototype instruments. To date, we have conducted over 70 projects for approximately 50 customers pursuant to this Technology Access Program, or TAP. In addition, in the third quarter of 2018 we announced the GeoMx Priority Site, or GPS, Program. The GPS Program is designed to provide customers the opportunity to be among the first to receive a GeoMx DSP instrument following its commercial launch, as well as advanced service and support. Inclusion in the GPS Program has also provided researchers the opportunity to begin generating data on samples through our TAP service. As of December 31, 2018, we have received over 30 orders for GeoMx DSP pursuant to our GPS Program. The full commercial launch of GeoMx DSP instruments and consumables is expected to commence during the first half of 2019, with installations of commercial instruments expected to commence in the second half of 2019.
The second new platform, our Hyb & Seq molecular profiling system, is designed to use a modified version of our proprietary chemistry to determine and analyze gene sequences within a biological sample, or to potentially profile the activity of an even greater number of genes as compared to our nCounter Analysis System. Hyb & Seq is designed to determine gene sequences using a work flow with fewer steps as compared to currently available gene sequencing technologies. Hyb & Seq is expected to become commercially available during 2021.
New discoveries in genetics have generated a significant amount of scientific information and medical advancement. The decoding of the human genome, and the subsequent generation of large amounts of gene sequence data, has led to the emergence of pathway-based biology whereby researchers seek to understand how networks of genes may work together to produce a biological function or condition. The desire to interpret gene sequence data and map biological pathways has led to demand for technologies that can precisely and efficiently measure the activation state of hundreds of genes simultaneously. 
Demand for these new or improved technologies has been driven by researchers in disease areas such as cancer, immunology and neurology. Researchers in these fields are increasingly attempting to determine which sequences of genes or mutations are important in disease-related biological pathways so that new potential treatments might be developed. For example, in the field of cancer, researchers and clinicians have learned that cancer cell behavior is impacted by multiple genes and proteins, and that analysis of these factors together may be important in determining whether or not a cancer might be responsive to a certain treatment. In addition, more cancers are being detected earlier and tumor samples are becoming smaller and smaller. Tumor samples are often stored in a format known as formalin-fixed paraffin embedded, or FFPE, which complicates subsequent analysis of genetic material. Researchers and clinicians may face similar challenges with analysis of biological samples in other therapeutic areas of interest.
Our proprietary chemistry, which has been incorporated into our nCounter product platform and our two product platforms in development, addresses many of the fundamental challenges of genetic and molecular profiling and biological

pathway research. The sensitivity and precision of our chemistry allows the measurement of subtle changes in the activity of multiple genes from minute amounts of a biological sample. Our chemistry is particularly compatible with FFPE, increasing its popularity among cancer researchers. Our chemistry also supports product configurations that are easy to use with simple workflow as compared to many other scientific platforms used for genetic and proteomic research, including absence of library preparation and amplification steps that can be cumbersome or time consuming or that may introduce the possibility of measurement errors. The sensitivity and workflow efficiency of our product platforms also allows for testing of many different samples in a single day, enabling our products to be potentially useful in hospital or similar settings to conduct clinical diagnostic tests.
We market and sell our systems and related consumables to researchers in academic, government and biopharmaceutical laboratories for research use and to clinical laboratories and medical centers for diagnostic use, both through our direct sales force and through selected distributors in certain international markets. We generated revenue of $106.7 million, $114.9 million, and $86.5 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, while incurring net losses of $77.4 million, $43.6 million, and $47.1 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Our Market Opportunity
Every living organism has a genome that contains a full set of biological instructions required to build and maintain life. A gene is a specific set of instructions embedded in the DNA of a cell. For a gene to be “turned on,” or “expressed,” the cell must first transcribe a copy of its DNA sequence into molecules of messenger RNA. Then, the cell translates the expressed information contained in the RNA into proteins that control most biological processes. In addition to the translated RNAs, there are many types of non-coding RNAs that are involved in many cellular processes and the control of gene expression, including microRNA, or miRNA.
By analyzing the variations in genomes, genes, gene activity or expression and proteins in and between organisms, researchers can determine their functions and roles in health and disease. An improved understanding of the genome and its functions allows researchers to drive advancements in scientific discovery. As they make scientific discoveries, researchers have been able to translate some of these findings into clinical applications that improve patient care.
Biological pathways are the networks of tens or hundreds of genes that work together to produce a biological function. Understanding the activation state of pathways and disruptions in individual elements provides significant insight into the fundamental basis of health and disease and facilitates data driven treatment decisions. As a result, pathway-based biology has become a widely adopted paradigm that researchers use to understand biological processes and has assisted them in the development of diagnostic tests and drugs to treat disease. 
Understanding biological pathways has become particularly important in cancer research and treatment. Cancer is a disease generally caused by genetic mutations in cells. The behavior of cancer cells is extremely complex and depends on the activity of many different genes and proteins. It is often impossible for researchers to identify a single gene or protein that adequately predicts a more or less aggressive type of cancer. In some cases, researchers have been able to identify more or less aggressive types of cancer through gene expression analysis of biological pathways, enabling oncologists to determine which specific treatments are most likely to be effective for an individual patient, monitor a patient’s response to those treatments and determine the likelihood of recurrence. Recently cancer researchers, in part based on their research of biological pathways and gene expression, have begun to demonstrate the potential of harnessing a patient’s immune system to fight cancer. A new class of therapeutics, referred to generally as immuno-oncology drugs, have begun to come to market with the promise of long-term remissions, or even cures, in certain types of cancer. 
As interest in understanding biological pathways that may be relevant to medicine has increased, academic, government and biopharmaceutical company researchers have aspired to perform analyses of a larger number of genes and samples and are seeking new methods of interrogation that would allow them to:
-4-


• | increase the number of molecular targets that can be analyzed simultaneously in order to understand the complete biological pathway involving multiple genes;


• | provide more reliable, precise and reproducible data about targeted genes and biological pathways;


• | maximize the amount of biologic information extracted from precious tissue or other biological samples;


• | minimize the computational intensity of complex genomic and proteomic analysis;


• | process difficult-to-work-with specimens, such as tumor biopsies stored in FFPE format;


• | improve the overall efficiency of their laboratories by simplifying workflow and accelerating the rate of successfully completing their research; and


• | create more systematic and reliable ways to help transition their research discoveries into future clinical products.

The interest in new methods of interrogation has led to the development of new research technologies. The newest technologies to experience rapid adoption have been focused primarily on determining the sequence of a person’s or organism’s DNA, in order to assess how differences among individuals might be predictive of certain aspects of health or disease. In particular, a technology known as next generation sequencing, or NGS, has become widely adopted. In recent years NGS use has accelerated, as the technology has improved and the cost to sequence DNA using NGS has declined. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 18,000 NGS systems installed in laboratories globally.
While NGS has revolutionized researchers’ ability to generate gene sequence data rapidly and cost effectively on large numbers of biological samples, other aspects of examining biological pathways are still done using legacy techniques or new technologies that have proved less capable of providing multiplexed experimentation, ease of use and low cost. Together with determining a gene sequence via NGS, pathway-based research requires further analysis of the activity of multiple genes and sensitivity to small changes in expression, which can be challenging for traditional scientific tools. 
Researchers interested in multiplex gene expression or biological pathway analysis have traditionally performed experiments using microarrays or quantitative polymerase chain reaction, or qPCR, and protein expression experiments using flow cytometry, mass spectrometry, immunohistochemistry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, assays. These techniques have been available for decades, and while suitable for analyzing the expression of a smaller number of genes may not be cost effective or scalable enough to study biological pathways. While these types of experiments could be repeated to analyze expression of multiple genes, they are often destructive of biological samples, creating limitations given the amounts of biological sample that may be available. These types of experiments may also involve library preparation and amplification steps that can be cumbersome or time consuming or that may introduce the possibility of measurement errors. 
More recently, RNA sequencing, or RNA-Seq, which is done using NGS technology, has enabled researchers to look at the entirety of the gene expression within a single sample, and enhanced researchers’ ability to discover patterns of gene expression that have biological meaning. NGS systems have a more complex and time-consuming workflow than traditional methods of analyzing gene or protein expression however, and RNA-Seq generates large amounts of data that may be expensive to store and may not have relevance to the scientific question being explored. 
In both life sciences research and clinical medicine, there is a growing need for improved technologies that can precisely and rapidly measure the activation state of hundreds of genes simultaneously across a large number of precious samples. Furthermore, there is an untapped opportunity for technologies capable of simultaneously profiling the activity of genes and related proteins, which ultimately dictate biological activity.
Our Solution
We believe our proprietary chemistry and product platforms provide novel features that address the challenges and technology needs of researchers working to analyze and interpret the increasing amounts of data being generated by NGS and understand biological pathways. Our products support experiments that typically take fewer steps as compared to traditional techniques, perform multiplexed experiments in a single run and have been shown to generate consistent and accurate results from a variety of biological samples, including FFPE imbedded cancer tissue.
Our technology and product platforms offer a number of compelling advantages, including:

• | Optimized for Pathway-Based Biology and Development of Multiplexed Biomarkers. Our nCounter Analysis System can profile the activity of up to 800 genes in a single experiment, which allows customers to analyze interactions among hundreds of genes or proteins that mediate biological pathways. Our GeoMx DSP System is designed to enable the multiplex profiling of protein and RNA targets in specifically selected regions of a biological sample.


• | Digital Precision. Our molecular barcodes hybridize directly to target molecules in a sample, allowing them to be counted. This generates digital data (1 molecule = 1 count) of excellent quality over a wide dynamic range of measurements and provides excellent reproducibility.


• | Simple Workflow. Our systems are designed to offer minimal sample preparation and automated workflow, which enables the simultaneous analysis of hundreds of genes and proteins in approximately 24 hours between the time a

-5-

sample is loaded and results are obtained. Our systems can generate data that customers can evaluate without the use of complex bioinformatics.

• | Flexible Sample Requirements. Our systems are designed to unlock biologic information from minute amounts of a variety of challenging tissue samples, including FFPE samples, cell lysates and single cells.


• | Efficient Sample Requirements. Our systems also can generate scientific results using very small amounts of biological material, which may be important in settings, such as pharmaceutical product development, where multiple researchers may desire access to samples.


• | Versatility. The FLEX configuration of our nCounter Analysis System provides clinical laboratories a single platform with the flexibility to support both clinical testing, by running Prosigna or Laboratory Developed Tests, and research, by processing translational research experiments and multiplexed assays using our research reagents.

Our Products and Technology
We currently have one commercially available product platform based on our technology, our nCounter Analysis System and related consumables. We also have two new product platforms under development enabled by our technology, our GeoMx DSP system and our Hyb & Seq molecular profiling system.
nCounter Analysis System
Our nCounter Analysis System is an automated, multi-application, digital detection and counting system which directly profiles hundreds of molecules simultaneously, using our proprietary optical barcoding chemistry that is powerful enough for use in research, yet simple enough for use in clinical laboratories. Our nCounter Analysis System is based on automated instruments that prepare and analyze tissue samples using proprietary reagents, which can only be obtained from us. Our research customers purchase instruments from us and then purchase our reagents and related consumables for the specific experiment they wish to conduct. Our clinical laboratory customers typically purchase instruments from us and also purchase our reagents and related consumables, including Prosigna, for tests that they intend to run.
Our nCounter Analysis System is capable of supporting a number of applications including:

• | Gene Expression. Researchers can use the nCounter Analysis System to measure the degree to which individual genes in pathways are turned “on” or “off” by simultaneously quantifying the amount of messenger RNA, or mRNA, associated with each of up to 800 genes.


• | Protein Expression. Today, researchers can use the nCounter Analysis System to simultaneously measure up to 30 proteins. Ultimately, we intend to expand this capability to an increased number of protein targets, limited only by the 800 target capacity of an assay and the number of antibodies that can be sourced and combined without cross-reaction.


• | Gene Mutations. In late 2016, we launched our first assay to detect a particular type of gene mutation, known as single nucleotide variations. Our initial panel, targeting solid tumors, gives researchers the power to measure 104 different gene mutations simultaneously, at the same time as measuring the expression of other genes and proteins.


• | miRNA Expression. Researchers can use the nCounter Analysis System to measure the simultaneous expression levels of up to 800 different miRNAs. The nCounter Analysis System is capable of highly multiplexed, direct digital detection and counting of miRNAs in a single reaction without amplification, thereby delivering high levels of sensitivity, specificity, precision, and linearity.


• | Copy Number Variation. Researchers can use the nCounter Analysis System to probe for structural variations that result in cells having an abnormal number of copies of one or more sections of the DNA. Researchers are able to conduct large-scale, statistically-powered studies of these copy number variations by leveraging the nCounter Analysis System’s multiplexing capacity to assay up to 800 DNA regions in a single tube, with as little as 300 ng of DNA.


• | Gene Fusions. Researchers can use the nCounter Analysis System to detect gene fusion events that occur when one gene fuses to another gene. A number of design options are available for developing assays for these complex structural variants which have been shown to be important in a number of cancers.


• | Molecular Diagnostics. Our nCounter Analysis System has the ability to simultaneously quantify gene expression on tens or hundreds of genes from minimal amounts of FFPE tissue, which makes it well suited for profiling pathway activation in tumor samples. Identifying whether certain genes are active in a biological sample may prove useful in the diagnosis of disease or disease progression, or in determining whether a certain drug therapy may be more or less effective in a given patient. In addition, nCounter has the precision, reproducibility, and simple workflow required of technologies used in clinical laboratories.

nCounter Instrument Platforms
We currently offer three versions of our nCounter analysis system for commercial sale. In 2008, we began marketing a research use only version of the system, and since that time we have expanded our product line to include three instruments, each targeted at a distinct user segment. Our nCounter SPRINT is designed to appeal to individual researchers running relatively smaller experiments. Our nCounter MAX is a higher throughput instrument with features appealing to larger core laboratories serving multiple researchers. Our nCounter FLEX, which is targeted toward clinical laboratories, is a version of our MAX system that has been 510(k) cleared by the FDA and CE marked by European regulatory authorities. nCounter FLEX is enabled to run our proprietary Prosigna breast cancer assay, as well as other proprietary or laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, that may be developed.

 | nCounter SPRINT | nCounter MAX | nCounter FLEX
Target customer | Individual researchers | Core research labs | Clinical labs
Throughput (samples per day) | 24 | 48 | 48 
Expandable with additional prep station (1) | No | Yes | Yes 
Diagnostic menu | No | No | Yes 
U.S. list price | $149,000 | $235,000 | $265,000 


(1) | nCounter MAX and FLEX throughput may be increased to up to 96 samples per day by adding a second prep station.

The nCounter MAX and FLEX systems comprise a Prep Station and a Digital Analyzer. The Prep Station is the automated liquid handling component that processes samples after they are hybridized and prepares the samples for data collection on the Digital Analyzer. The Digital Analyzer collects data from samples by taking images of the immobilized fluorescent reporters in the sample cartridge and processing the data into output files, which include the target identifier and related count numbers along with a broad set of internal controls that validate the precision of each assay. The nCounter MAX and FLEX systems employ a simple three-step workflow that takes approximately 24 hours and requires approximately 15 minutes of hands-on time by the user. When run in research mode, a user can process up to 48 samples per day by installing one Prep Station with a single Digital Analyzer. One can increase the number of samples analyzed to 96 samples per day on a single Digital Analyzer if it is coupled with two Prep Stations. This throughput can be quadrupled using sample multiplexing for experiments targeting 200 genes or fewer. For Prosigna, a clinical laboratory can process up to 30 samples per day on an nCounter FLEX system. The nCounter FLEX system was designed and is manufactured under ISO 13485:2003, the current quality standard for in vitro diagnostic platforms and medical devices.
The nCounter SPRINT Profiler is a single instrument targeted to individual researchers that combines the liquid handling steps and the digital analysis through use of a special microfluidic cartridge. The nCounter SPRINT Profiler employs an even more streamlined two-step workflow that requires only 10 minutes of hands-on time by the user and can process up to 24 samples per day.
nCounter instrument platforms also include our nSolver Analysis Software, a data analysis program that offers researchers the ability to quickly and easily quality check, normalize, and analyze their data without having to use any additional software for data analysis. The FLEX system, in addition to running any of our research applications, can also be enabled with software that runs Prosigna to generate individualized patient reports.
nCounter Consumables
All three nCounter instruments are capable of running our research consumable products and provide comparable, high-quality data. The majority of our nCounter consumables sold are standardized off-the-shelf “panel” products that represent important gene signatures for certain disease areas, and also include our proprietary Prosigna breast cancer assay. nCounter consumables can also be customized to a specific set of genes at a customer’s request. 
Panels
We offer more than 30 gene expression and analysis panels for use with a broad range of sample types and species, including human, mouse, non-human primate and other. These pre-manufactured CodeSets include highly-curated content relevant to a particular research area. In certain cases, nCounter panels may be partially customized to address individual research interests with the purchase of an optional Panel Plus CodeSet. Our most significant current nCounter panel offerings include:

• | Pan Cancer Gene Expression Panels. A portfolio of panels designed to comprehensively analyze genes driving the growth of cancer cells, the immune system’s response, and the progression of the cancer, including:

-7-


• | Pathways. A novel set of 770 essential genes representing the signaling pathways implicated in cancer, including key driver genes, selected using a data-driven approach to identifying the genes most relevant to cancer biology.


• | Immune Profiling. A novel set of 770 genes designed in collaboration with cancer immunologists around the globe, combining markers for 24 different immune cell types and populations, 30 common cancer antigens and genes that represent all known categories of immune response including key checkpoint blockade genes.


• | Progression. A novel set of 770 genes addressing the key questions of what happens when cancer metastasizes, including genes for the study of angiogenesis, epithelial mesenchymal transition, extracellular matrix formation, and metastasis.


• | PanCancer RNA: Protein Immune Profiling Panels. Two panels that combine gene expression analysis of the 770 genes contained in the PanCancer Immune Profiling Gene Expression Panel with the analysis of up to 30 proteins of interest in measuring the immune system’s response to cancer or intracellular signaling.


• | 360 Gene Expression Panels. These panels include our IO 360 and Breast Cancer 360 and represent a series of next generation panels that combine clinically actionable content for evaluating the tumor microenvironment and immune response along with validated signatures such as the Company's Tumor Inflammation Signature and PAM 50 (breast cancer subtyping) along with up to 30 additional signatures encompassing all aspects of the cancer. These panels may be combined with our 360 Data Analysis Service to provide access to propriety signature algorithms.


• | CAR-T Characterization Panel. A new panel developed in collaboration with leaders in the CAR-T field for use throughout the CAR-T workflow (development, manufacturing and monitoring post-infusion clinical trials). The panel represents a step toward standardization by providing molecular characterization for 8 essential components of CAR-T biology using 780 genes with a customizable feature to allow for measurement of the transgene insert that creates the CAR-T cell.


• | Neuropathology and Neuroinflammation Gene Expression Panels. Two panels built in collaboration with leading drug developers, have been designed to address the growing biomarker needs in the field of neuroscience. These panels, which analyze approximately 770 genes profile mechanisms for neurodegenerative diseases as well as neuropsychiatric disorders.


• | Mouse-AD Panel. A new panel developed for use with Alzheimer’s Disease, or AD, research in mouse models. The panel, created in collaboration with The Jackson Laboratories and MODEL-AD Consortium allows for more reliable pre-clinical translational studies by incorporating gene content for 30 clinically derived AD associated gene modules for measuring AD phenotypes and disease progression that were discovered as part of a consortium study of human brain tissue.


• | Autoimmune Disease Gene Expression Panels. Two panels created to address the specific challenges of autoimmune disease research and assist with the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of autoimmune disease and for identification of potential responders and non-responders to drug treatments.


• | miRNA Expression Panels. A family of panels that provide a cost-effective profiling solution capable of highly multiplexed, direct digital detection and counting of up to 800 miRNAs in a single reaction without amplification.

Custom CodeSets
We work with our customers to design and develop custom gene expression CodeSets to enable them to evaluate specific genes that are the subject of their study. Our customers provide us a list of targets for which we subsequently build a unique CodeSet to their specifications. Our design process leverages full length sequences for the DNA or RNA molecules that our customers are interested in detecting and prevents cross hybridization to non-target molecules in the sample. The custom CodeSet design process occurs in four distinct steps: (1) the customer selects the genes of interest, (2) we design probes and provide a design report to the customer, (3) the customer reviews and approves the design report, and (4) we manufacture, test and ship the CodeSet to the customer. The manufacturing process typically takes from three to five weeks, depending on the number of genes targeted and samples to be processed by the customer.
Master Kits, Cartridges and Reagents
For our nCounter MAX or FLEX systems, the Master Kit includes all of the ancillary reagents and plasticware required for our customers to be able to setup and process samples in the nCounter Prep Station and nCounter Digital Analyzer. The components of the Master Kit include the sample cartridge, strip tubes, tips, buffers, and reagent plates. For our nCounter SPRINT Profiler, customers purchase microfluidic cartridges and separate bottles of reagents which together provide the ancillary components for processing samples with CodeSets and Panels.

Molecular Diagnostics
Our nCounter Analysis System has the ability to simultaneously quantify gene expression on tens or hundreds of genes from minimal amounts of FFPE tissue, which makes it well-suited for profiling pathway activation in tumor samples. In addition, it has the precision, reproducibility, and simple workflow required of technologies used in clinical laboratories. Our clinical laboratory customers use the nCounter Analysis System and in vitro diagnostic kits to provide clinical diagnostic services. Currently, Prosigna is the only in vitro diagnostic kit available for use on our nCounter Analysis System. Over time, we intend to develop, obtain regulatory authorization for, and sell additional in vitro diagnostic kits.
We believe that the attributes that make the nCounter Analysis System attractive to researchers also make the system attractive to hospitals and clinical laboratories that desire to conduct molecular diagnostic tests. We believe the precision, ease of use and flexibility of the nCounter Analysis System may allow medical technicians to conduct complex molecular diagnostic tests with minimal training. Our clinical laboratory customers use the nCounter FLEX system and in vitro diagnostic kits to provide clinical diagnostic services. Currently, Prosigna is the only in vitro diagnostic kit available for use on our nCounter FLEX system. We have one additional in vitro diagnostic test, our proprietary LymphMark assay, under development pursuant to a collaboration with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene.

• | Prosigna. Prosigna, our first in vitro molecular diagnostic test, is based on a collection of 50 genes known as the PAM50 gene signature, which was discovered by several of our research customers. Prosigna can provide a breast cancer patient and physician with a subtype classification based on the fundamental biology of the patient’s tumor, as well as a prognostic score that indicates the probability of cancer recurrence over 10 years. Physicians use Prosigna to help guide therapeutic decisions so that patients receive a therapeutic intervention, such as chemotherapy, only if clinically warranted. Prosigna is regulated as an in vitro diagnostic test and we distribute it as a kit for use on our nCounter FLEX system in clinical laboratories. In September 2013, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market in the United States a version of Prosigna providing a prognostic indicator for distant recurrence-free survival at 10 years, which is indicated for postmenopausal women with Stage I/II lymph node-negative or Stage II lymph node-positive (one to three positive nodes) hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who have undergone surgery in conjunction with locoregional treatment consistent with standard of care. For each patient, the Prosigna report includes the Prosigna Score, which is referred to as the ROR Score in the scientific literature and outside the United States, and a risk category based on both the Prosigna Score and nodal status. Node-negative patients are classified as low, intermediate or high risk, while node-positive patients are classified as low or high risk. Prosigna competes with other tests that are currently available as services from specialized central laboratories. In September 2012, we obtained CE mark designation for Prosigna for use as a semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic assay using the gene expression profile of cells found in FFPE breast tumor tissue to assess the 10-year risk of distant recurrence in postmenopausal women with HR+ early stage breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy alone. This CE-marked product is indicated for use in patients with either node-negative or node-positive disease and provides physicians and their patients with the intrinsic subtype of a patient’s breast cancer tumor, ROR score, and risk category (high/intermediate/low). In early 2013, we began marketing this test in Europe and Israel. We sell Prosigna kits to our lab customers on a fixed dollars-per-kit basis. These customers are responsible for providing the testing service and contracting and billing payors. Accordingly, we are not directly exposed to third-party payor reimbursement risk.


• | LymphMark. Our proprietary LymphMark assay, an in vitro molecular diagnostic test candidate under development, is intended to identify the cell-of-origin subtype of a tumor for patients with diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, a form of blood cancer. LymphMark is designed to aid in the disease characterization of patients newly diagnosed with DLBCL to support disease management in conjunction with other clinical and pathological information. DLBCL is a heterogeneous group of cancers that represents the most common form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. According to the National Cancer Institute, there were approximately 70,000 new cases of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in the United States in 2015. DLBCL is the most common type of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, representing approximately 1 out of every 3 cases. The subtypes of DLBCL have long been known to have varying prognoses. In January 2014, certain of our research customers published a paper in the journal Blood describing the development and validation of a biomarker assay based on a 20-gene expression DLBCL subtype classifier using our nCounter Analysis System. LymphMark is currently being specifically investigated as an aid for identifying DLBCL patients that may be most likely to benefit from treatment with Celgene’s drug REVLIMID. Under our collaboration with Celgene, we have delivered an in vitro companion diagnostic test that was used to subtype and screen patients who enrolled in a pivotal study of REVLIMID for the treatment of DLBCL. The results of Celgene’s study are expected to be announced in 2019, after which we may file for regulatory approval with the FDA to market and sell LymphMark.


• | Laboratory Developed Tests. Clinical laboratories can use our custom manufacturing services to supply reagents to create LDTs, which are diagnostic tests that are developed, validated and performed by a single laboratory. These reagents enable assays for gene expression, copy number variation and gene fusions. Clinical laboratories can use

-9-

these reagents to develop assays to replace tests currently performed using fluorescence-based in situ hybridization, or FISH.
GeoMx DSP
Our second product platform, GeoMx DSP, is currently under development. Our GeoMx DSP system is designed to enable the field of spatial genomics.
nCounter and other existing technologies typically analyze gene activity throughout the totality of a biological sample, using “grind and bind” approaches that analyze average gene expression levels across an entire sample. GeoMx DSP is designed to allow researchers to explore and quantify how the activity of large numbers of proteins or genes vary spatially in different selected regions of interest across the landscape of a heterogeneous tissue biopsy, retaining spatial information and providing high-plex assays that target different regions in the same sample.
The commercial launch of the GeoMx DSP instrument and consumables is expected to commence during the first half of 2019, with installations of commercial instruments expected to commence in the second half of 2019.
Many of the current technologies used to analyze gene activity in selected parts of a biological sample are many decades old. These technologies include primarily immunohistochemistry, or IHC, which is used to estimate amounts of protein, and in-situ hybridization, or ISH, which is used to estimate amounts of RNA. Both IHC and ISH typically use stains that provide the ability to identify typically less than four proteins or RNAs based on assigned colors. The colors aid researchers in identifying where certain proteins or RNA may reside in a sample and provide a visual approximation of amounts. These techniques are limited however in their ability to only look at four proteins or RNAs at a time, with no ability to precisely quantify the amounts present in any given region or cell type. These limitations may lead to misleading or incomplete scientific conclusions as to the most relevant biological pathways in any given sample.
GeoMx DSP is designed to allow researchers to address important questions regarding how protein and gene expression vary spatially across multiple specific regions of interest across the landscape of a heterogeneous tissue biopsy. Our GeoMx DSP instruments are expected to image slide-mounted tissue biopsies, allow selection of regions of interest, and automate the preparation of samples from selected regions for molecular profiling using either an nCounter system or NGS. GeoMx DSP technology is expected to offer a number of advantages compared to traditional technologies, including the ability to profile a larger number of different genes or proteins in each region, more flexibility on the selection of regions, and processing of a larger number of samples per day. 
GeoMx DSP Instrument
Our GeoMx DSP instruments use specialized optics and software to image slide-mounted tissue biopsies that have been prepared using IHC or ISH technology that is typically available in research or commercial laboratories. GeoMx then allows a researcher to select regions of interest for analysis on screen, and then prepares samples from selected regions of interest for molecular profiling using either an nCounter system or next generation gene sequencer.
GeoMx DSP Consumables
The initial portfolio of GeoMx DSP consumables at launch is expected to focus on protein and RNA analysis for immuno-oncology applications, and protein analysis for neurobiology applications. GeoMx DSP consumables expected to be available at the commercial launch date will be designed to support the profiling of biological activity, after regions of interest have been identified and samples have been prepared using GeoMx DSP, using our nCounter Analysis System. We have additional GeoMx DSP consumable products under development that are expected to enable profiling of larger numbers of RNA in selected regions of interest using an NGS system. We expect these NGS-enabled consumable products to be commercially available in 2020.
GeoMx DSP consumable products are currently designed as standardized panel products that represent important content for certain disease areas, with an initial “core” panel offered for purchase, and an option for researchers to add content to that core depending on the area of interest or desired number of targets for analysis. Our initial GeoMx DSP consumable product offering is expected to include: 

• | Immuno-Oncology Panels. An immuno-oncology-focused panel menu that is expected to comprise up to 90 protein targets and 84 RNA targets for analyzing the tumor and tumor microenvironment compartments in human tissue samples. The standard or core panel offering is expected to comprise of 20 targets, and researchers will then have the option of adding over 40 additional targets for analysis, with sets of additional targets focused on specific applications such as immuno-oncology drug target proteins, or human immune activation proteins. We also expect to offer panel content to allow for the analysis of up to 84 immune pathways RNA. Additionally, 30 protein targets are expected to be released for analyzing mouse samples for pre-clinical applications.

• | Neurobiology Panels. A neurobiology-focused menu that is expected to comprise up to 40 protein targets to profile neural cells in human tissue. The standard or core panel offering is expected to comprise of 20 targets, and researchers will then have the option of adding up to 20 additional targets for analysis, with sets of additional targets focused on specific applications such as proteins implicated in AD or Parkinson’s disease.

Hyb & Seq Molecular Profiler
Our third product platform, our Hyb & Seq molecular profiling system, is currently under development. Hyb & Seq is designed to use a modified version of our proprietary chemistry to determine and analyze gene sequences within a biological sample, or to potentially profile the activity of an even greater number of genes.
While currently available NGS technology has become widely used for research, challenges relating to complex workflow and the need for a large central laboratory to batch process samples to reduce cost have limited broader NGS adoption for use in clinical diagnostic applications to date.
Hyb & Seq is designed to use a modified version of our proprietary chemistry to determine sequence data similar to NGS. As our chemistry does not require amplification, enzyme application or library preparation, Hyb & Seq may offer a faster, easier to use way of determining gene sequences as compared to existing NGS technologies. Hyb & Seq's simple workflow and compatibility with a variety of sample types may offer the potential for a sample-to-answer solution for clinical sequencing. Hyb & Seq may also offer the ability to rapidly detect and quantify a large number of RNA or DNA targets in parallel. Potential applications of this capability could include gene expression measurement, or infectious disease testing.
Hyb & Seq is expected to become commercially available in 2021. 
Collaborations
Lam Research Corporation
In August 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Lam Research Corporation, or Lam, to develop our Hyb & Seq sequencing platform and related assays. Under the terms of the agreement, Lam will contribute up to an aggregate of $50.0 million towards the project. The development funding is non-refundable, unless the parties determine that completion of development of the product will not continue, in which case any funds advanced to us by Lam that have not been committed or spent will be refunded to Lam. We will reimburse Lam for the cost of up to 10 full-time Lam employees each year in accordance with the product development plan. Lam is eligible to receive certain single-digit percentage royalty payments from us on net sales of certain products and technologies developed under the agreement, if any such net sales are recorded. The maximum amount of royalties we may pay to Lam will be capped at an amount up to three times the amount of development funding actually provided by Lam. We retain exclusive rights to obtain regulatory approval, manufacture and commercialize any Hyb & Seq products.
All intellectual property made or conceived solely by us pursuant to the collaboration will be owned by us and licensed to Lam solely for the purposes of the collaboration. All intellectual property made or conceived solely by Lam pursuant to the collaboration will be owned by Lam and, subject to certain restrictions on use with Lam competitors, licensed to us for the purposes of the collaboration and further development and commercialization of our Hyb & Seq platform, as well as certain other products and technologies resulting from the collaboration in the field of molecular profiling. Jointly created intellectual property will be jointly owned, provided that neither we nor Lam use such jointly owned intellectual property in the other party’s competitive field.
The collaboration agreement establishes a joint steering committee to oversee, review and coordinate our and Lam’s activities under the collaboration agreement and monitor progress and expenditures against the associated development plan. The joint steering committee is comprised of three employees from each of us and Lam, and will be chaired by one of our employees. We will have final decision-making authority on the joint steering committee, subject to certain exceptions for decisions regarding development failure, material changes to the development plan, budget, and the Hyb & Seq product being developed under the agreement, and intellectual property ownership, which require consensus of the parties. The collaboration agreement also contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and other obligations of the parties.
The term of the collaboration agreement is 15 years. Either we or Lam may terminate the collaboration agreement in the case of a material breach by the other party after providing notice and an opportunity to cure or in the case of bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. The joint steering committee may also terminate the collaboration agreement if development is discontinued in the case of a development failure. Lam may also terminate the collaboration agreement on or after the first anniversary in the event we undergo a change of control.
In connection with the execution of the collaboration agreement, we issued Lam a warrant to purchase up to 1.0 million shares of our common stock with the number of underlying shares exercisable at any time proportionate to the amount of the $50.0 million commitment that has been provided by Lam. The exercise price of the warrant is $16.75 per share, and it 
-11-

will expire on the seventh anniversary of the issuance date. The warrant was determined to have a fair value of $6.7 million upon issuance, which will be recorded as additional paid in capital proportionately from the quarterly collaboration payments made by Lam.
In connection with the entry into the collaboration agreement and issuance of the warrant, we and Lam have agreed, subject to certain exceptions applicable to Lam, to be bound by certain “standstill” provisions. Pursuant to the “standstill” provisions, until the third anniversary of the entry into the collaboration agreement, we, Lam and our respective officers, directors, employees or contractors acting on their behalf will not (1) acquire, offer to acquire, agree to acquire or publicly propose or offer to acquire, securities, indebtedness, businesses, properties or assets of the other party or any subsidiary or division thereof; (2) initiate, induce or attempt to induce any other person or group to initiate any transaction referred to in clause (1), any stockholder proposal regarding the other party or call hold or convene a stockholders’ meeting of the other party; (3) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any voting securities of the other party; (4) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit a proposal or offer for any extraordinary transaction involving the other party or any of its securities or assets; (5) form, join or in any way participate in a group as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in connection with any of the foregoing prohibited activities; (6) act or seek to control or influence the management, board of directors or policies of the other party; (7) take any action that could reasonably be expected to require the other party to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of any of the prohibited activities described in clauses (1) through (6) or (8) advise, assist or encourage any other person in connection with any of the foregoing prohibited activities.
In addition, Lam has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to offer, sell or transfer any of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock, for three years after the entry into the collaboration agreement without first obtaining our consent, which we may withhold in our sole discretion, unless the collaboration agreement has been terminated, in which case our consent may not be unreasonably withheld.
Celgene Corporation
In March 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Celgene to develop, seek regulatory approval for, and commercialize a companion diagnostic assay using the nCounter Analysis System to identify a subset of patients with DLBCL, who are believed to be the most likely to benefit from treatment with Celgene’s drug REVLIMID. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we will develop, seek regulatory approval for, and commercialize the diagnostic test, and we retain the flexibility to independently develop and commercialize additional indications for the test. Pursuant to our agreement, as amended in February 2018, we are eligible to receive payments from Celgene totaling up to $24.8 million, of which $5.8 million was received as an upfront payment and $19.0 million is for development funding and potential success-based developmental and regulatory milestones. In February 2018, Celgene agreed to provide us with additional funding for work intended to enable a subtype and prognostic indication for the test being developed under the agreement. In connection with this amendment, we agreed to remove the right to receive payments from Celgene in the event commercial sales of the companion diagnostic test do not exceed certain pre-specified minimum annual revenues during the first three years following regulatory approval. In addition, the amendment allows Celgene, at its election, to use trial samples with additional technologies for companion diagnostics.
Under the collaboration agreement with Celgene, we have delivered an in vitro companion diagnostic test that was used to subtype and screen patients who enrolled in a pivotal study of REVLIMID for the treatment of DLBCL. The upfront payment, a portion of the success-based milestone payments and the payments related to the subsequent amendments, totaling $14.5 million, have been received from Celgene to date, and we are using these funds in part to cover our costs for clinical development of the test.
Merck & Co., Inc.
In May 2015, we entered into a clinical research collaboration agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck, to develop an assay intended to optimize immune-related gene expression signatures and evaluate the potential to predict benefit from Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA, in multiple tumor types. In February 2016, we expanded our collaboration with Merck by entering into a new development collaboration agreement to clinically develop, seek regulatory approval for, and commercialize a companion diagnostic test to predict response to KEYTRUDA in multiple tumor types. In connection with the execution of the development collaboration agreement, we and Merck terminated our May 2015 clinical research collaboration and moved all remaining activities under such clinical research collaboration work plan to the new development collaboration agreement. In October 2017, we were notified by Merck of the decision not to pursue regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic test for KEYTRUDA. As a result, in August 2018, we and Merck agreed to mutually terminate our development collaboration agreement, effective as of September 30, 2018, following the completion of certain close-out activities.
-12-

Medivation, Inc. and Astellas Pharma, Inc.
In January 2016, we entered into a collaboration with Medivation, Inc., or Medivation, and Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, to pursue the translation of a novel gene expression signature algorithm discovered by Medivation into a companion diagnostic assay using the nCounter Analysis System. In September 2016, Medivation was acquired by Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. In May 2017, we received notification from Pfizer and Astellas terminating the collaboration agreement as a result of a decision to discontinue the related clinical trial. 
Intellectual Property
We must develop and maintain protection on the proprietary aspects of our technologies in order to remain competitive. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality, material transfer agreements, licenses, invention assignment agreements and other contracts to protect our intellectual property rights.
As of December 31, 2018, we owned or exclusively licensed 27 issued U.S. patents and approximately 36 pending U.S. patent applications, including provisional and non-provisional filings. We also owned or licensed approximately 266 pending and granted counterpart applications worldwide, including 118 country-specific validations of 13 European patents. The issued U.S. patents that we own or exclusively license are expected to expire between July 3, 2021 and February 6, 2033. We have either sole or joint ownership positions in all of our pending U.S. patent applications. Where we jointly own cases, we typically have negotiated license or assignment provisions to obtain exclusive rights. For our material nCounter Analysis System and Prosigna product rights, we are the exclusive licensee. We also generally protect our newly developed intellectual property by entering into confidentiality agreements that include intellectual property assignment clauses with our employees, consultants and collaborators. Our patent applications generally relate to the following main areas: 

• | our nCounter Analysis System biology, chemistry, methods and hardware;


• | specific applications for our nCounter Analysis System technology;


• | our gene expression markers, methods and gene signatures for recurrence and drug response in certain forms of cancer;


• | biological and chemical compositions, methods and hardware for enzyme and amplification free sequencing; and


• | biological and chemical compositions, methods and hardware for multiplexed detection and quantification of protein and/or nucleic acid expression in a defined region of a tissue or cell.

We intend to file additional patent applications in the United States and abroad to strengthen our intellectual property rights; however, our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot assure investors that any patents that have issued or might issue will protect our technology. We have received notices of claims of potential infringement from third parties and may receive additional notices in the future. When appropriate, we have taken a license to the intellectual property rights from such third parties. For additional information, see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
We own a number of trademarks and develop names for our new products and as appropriate secure trademark protection for them, including domain name registration, in relevant jurisdictions.
License Agreements
We have relied, and expect to continue to rely, on strategic collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. For example, our base molecular barcoding technology is in-licensed from the Institute for Systems Biology and the intellectual property that forms the basis of Prosigna is in-licensed from Bioclassifier, LLC. In addition to the licenses with the Institute for Systems Biology and Bioclassifier, we have licensed technology related to the DLBCL assay from the National Institutes of Health, and we rely on other license and supply arrangements for proprietary components which require us to pay royalties on the sale of our products. Other research customers are using our nCounter Analysis System to discover gene expression signatures that we believe could form the basis of future diagnostic products. In the future, we may consider these gene signatures for in-licensing. Our licensing arrangements with the Institute for Systems Biology and Bioclassifier are discussed below in greater detail.
Institute for Systems Biology
In 2004, we entered into an agreement with the Institute for Systems Biology pursuant to which the Institute granted to us an exclusive, subject to certain government rights, worldwide license, including the right to sublicense, to the digital molecular barcoding technology on which our nCounter Analysis System is based, including 13 patents and patent applications. Pursuant to the terms of the amended license agreement, we are required to pay the Institute for Systems Biology royalties on net sales of products sold by us, or our sublicensees, at a low single digit percentage rate, which was reduced by 50% in the 
-13-

third quarter of 2016 for the remainder of the license term due to the achievement of a cumulative sales threshold. Through December 31, 2018, we have paid aggregate royalties of $5.7 million under the license agreement. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the amended license agreement, the agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire patent licensed to us. The Institute for Systems Biology has the right to terminate the agreement under certain situations, including our failure to meet certain diligence requirements or our uncured material breach of the agreement.
Bioclassifier, LLC
In July 2010, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Bioclassifier, LLC, pursuant to which Bioclassifier granted to us an exclusive, subject to certain government rights, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, to certain intellectual property rights and technology, including eight non-provisional patent applications, related to the PAM50 gene signature in the field of research products and prognostic and/or diagnostic tests for cancer, including Prosigna. Bioclassifier has licensed these rights from the academic institutions that employed the cancer researchers that discovered or were involved in the initial development of PAM50. Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to pay Bioclassifier the greater of certain minimum royalty amounts and mid-single digit to low double digit percentage royalties on net sales of products and/or methods sold by us that are covered by patent rights or include, use or are technology licensed to us. Our obligation to pay royalties to Bioclassifier expires on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last patent licensed or, if a product or method includes, uses or is technology licensed to us but is not covered by a patent licensed to us, ten years after the first commercial sale of the product or method in such country. We are also required to pay Bioclassifier a percentage of any income received by us from the grant of a sublicense to the patents or technology licensed to us under the agreement. In July 2018, we agreed to amend our license agreement with Bioclassifier to increase the current royalty rate paid to Bioclassifier on sales of licensed products in the United States to an upper-single digit percentage, which became effective January 1, 2018. The agreement specifies that we will control and be responsible for the costs of prosecuting and enforcing the intellectual property licensed in certain major market countries. The agreement also includes customary rights of termination for Bioclassifier, including for our uncured material breach or our bankruptcy. Through December 31, 2018, we have paid Bioclassifier $2.2 million.
Research and Development
We have committed, and expect to continue to commit, significant resources to developing new technologies and products, improving product performance and reliability and reducing costs. We are continuously seeking to improve our product platforms, including the technology, software, accessibility and overall capability. We also seek to develop additional research consumable content, and new potential molecular diagnostic tests. We have assembled experienced research and development teams at our Seattle, Washington location with the scientific, engineering, software and process talent that we believe is required to successfully grow our business. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 173 employees in research and development, of which 58 hold a Ph.D. degree and one holds an M.D. degree. 
Sales and Marketing
We began selling nCounter Analysis Systems to researchers in 2008 and began sales efforts in the clinical laboratory market in 2013. We sell our instruments and related products primarily through our own sales force in North America and through a combination of direct and distributor channels in Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and South America. We have agreements with 28 distributors, each of which is specific to a certain territory. In the event a distributor does not meet minimum performance requirements, we may terminate the distribution agreement or convert from an exclusive to non-exclusive arrangement within the territory, allowing us to enter into arrangements with other distributors for the territory. 
For additional information regarding geographic distribution of revenue, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this report. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our collaborator, Lam, represented 17% of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, two customers/collaborators, Merck, and Medivation, Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc., represented 25% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Merck represented 13% of our total revenue. 
Instrumentation and Research Consumables
Our sales and marketing efforts for instrumentation and in the life sciences research market are targeted at department heads, research or clinical laboratory directors, principal investigators, core facility directors, and research scientists and pathologists at leading academic institutions, biopharmaceutical companies, publicly and privately-funded research institutions and contract research organizations. We seek to increase awareness of our products among our target customers through direct sales calls, trade shows, seminars, academic conferences, web presence and other forms of internet marketing.
Our instruments require a significant capital investment or commitment to a lease or reagent rental agreement. Accordingly, our sales process involves numerous interactions with multiple people within an organization, and often includes 
-14-

in-depth analysis by potential customers of our products, proof-of-principle studies, preparation of extensive documentation and a lengthy review process. As a result of these factors, the large capital investment required in purchasing our instruments and the budget cycles of our customers, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order can vary significantly and be up to 12 months or longer. Given the length and uncertainty of our sales cycle, we have in the past experienced, and likely will in the future experience, fluctuations in our instrument sales on a period-to-period basis.
We have continued to invest in our commercial channel to increase our reach and productivity. During 2017 and 2018, we added staff focused on sales of our consumable products to support our existing instrument-focused sales staff. We believe these investments helped to drive the growth of our installed instrument base, and the continued utilization of our consumables by our installed base of instrument users.
Molecular Diagnostics
The commercialization of Prosigna kits involves a three-pronged effort. First, we seek to establish third-party reimbursement and patient access for clinical testing services that our clinical laboratory customers will provide based upon our products by gaining inclusion in influential treatment guidelines and educating third-party payors regarding the clinical utility and health economic value of the clinical tests enabled by our technology. Second, we seek to establish an installed base of nCounter Analysis Systems by selling or leasing instruments to select clinical laboratories, with initial sales efforts directed at laboratories, hospitals, networks or practices that test or treat a high volume of breast cancer patients. Third, we intend to drive physician demand for clinical testing services enabled by our diagnostic products, and direct test orders toward those laboratories which have adopted our technology. Where appropriate, we intend to coordinate commercial efforts with the sales and marketing personnel of the clinical laboratories offering clinical testing services based on our diagnostic products.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We use third-party contract manufacturers to produce our instruments and certain raw materials for our consumables. We build our consumables, including our Panels, Custom CodeSets and reagent packages at our Seattle, Washington facility.
Instruments
We outsource manufacturing of our instruments. Precision System Science, Co., Ltd. of Chiba, Japan, or PSS, is our sole source supplier for the nCounter Prep Station. Korvis Automation Inc., or Korvis, is our sole source supplier for our nCounter Digital Analyzers and our GeoMx DSP instrument at its facility in Corvallis, Oregon. Paramit Corporation, or Paramit, is our sole source supplier for our nCounter SPRINT Profiler at its facility in Morgan Hill, California.
The facilities at which our instruments are built have been certified to ISO 13485:2003 standards. Our contracts with these instrument suppliers do not commit them to carry inventory or make available any particular quantities. Under the terms of the three instrument supply agreements, we are required to place binding purchase orders for instruments that will be delivered to us by the supplier three to six months from the date of placement of the purchase order. Although qualifying alternative third-party manufacturers could be time consuming and expensive, our instruments’ design is similar to other instruments and we believe that alternatives would be available if necessary. However, if our instrument suppliers terminate our relationship with them or if they give other customers’ needs higher priority than ours, then we may not be able to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms.
Consumables
We manufacture our consumables in our Seattle, Washington facility which has been certified to ISO 13485:2003 standards. We expanded our manufacturing capacity in 2015 by relocating certain research and development functions and converting the space to incremental manufacturing labs and offices. In the future, should additional space become necessary, we believe that there will be space available near our existing facility that we believe we can secure; however, we cannot predict that this space will be available if and when it is needed.
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components and materials used in the manufacture of our consumables. Some of these components are sourced from a single supplier. For example, Cidra Precision Services, LLC, of Wallingford, Connecticut, part of IDEX Health & Science, is the sole supplier of the microfluidic cartridge for our nCounter SPRINT Profiler. For some components, we have qualified second sources for several of our critical reagents, including oligonucleotides, adhesives and dyes. We believe that having dual sources for our components helps reduce the risk of a production delay caused by a disruption in the supply of a critical component. We continue to pursue qualifying additional suppliers, but cannot predict how expensive, time-consuming or successful these efforts will be. If we were to lose one or more of our suppliers, it may take significant time and effort to qualify alternative suppliers.
-15-

Competition
In the life sciences research market, we compete with companies such as Agilent Technologies, Becton-Dickinson, Bio-Rad, Bio-Techne, Fluidigm, HTG Molecular Diagnostics, Illumina, Luminex, Merck Millipore, O-Link, Perkin Elmer, Qiagen, Roche Applied Science, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and 10x Genomics, some of which also offer diagnostic applications of their technologies. These competitors and others have products for gene and protein expression analysis that compete in certain segments of the market in which we sell our products. In addition, there are a number of new market entrants in the process of developing novel technologies for the life sciences market.
In the breast cancer diagnostics market, we compete with Genomic Health’s Oncotype Dx, a service for gene expression analysis performed in a central laboratory in Redwood City, California. We also face competition from companies such as Agendia and bioTheranostics, which also offer centralized laboratories that profile gene or protein expression in breast cancer. Outside the United States, we also face regional competition from Myriad Genetics, and its product EndoPredict, a distributed test for breast cancer recurrence.
We believe that we have multiple competitive advantages in the research market, including the automated nature of our systems with simple, rapid and efficient workflow that requires very limited human intervention or labor; the multiplexing capability of our technology to analyze significantly more target molecules in a single tube without amplification, representing multiple biological pathways; the ability to analyze combinations of DNA, RNA and proteins simultaneously in a single experiment; compatibility with many sample types, including difficult samples such as FFPE; and the ability to analyze small sample inputs, in some cases down to a single cell, from a wide variety of sample types. 
In the diagnostics market, we believe our competitive advantages include the compelling evidence of Prosigna’s ability to inform major medical treatment decisions, including results from our studies; the quality of our nCounter Analysis System, which enables consistent and reproducible results in decentralized laboratories; and the improved convenience for physicians and patients, including more rapid test result turnaround time.
While we believe that we compete favorably based on the factors described above, many of our competitors enjoy other competitive advantages over us, including:

• | greater name and brand recognition, financial and human resources;


• | broader product lines;


• | larger sales forces and more established distributor networks;


• | substantial intellectual property portfolios;


• | larger and more established customer bases and relationships; and


• | better established, larger scale and lower cost manufacturing capabilities.

For additional information, see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors - The life sciences research and diagnostics markets are highly competitive. If we fail to compete effectively, our business and operating results will suffer.”
Government Regulation
Medical Device Regulation
United States
In the United States, medical devices, including in vitro diagnostics, are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, medical device development, testing, labeling, storage, premarket clearance or approval, advertising and promotion and product sales and distribution.
A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component part or accessory, which is (1) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or (2) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. In vitro diagnostics are a type of medical device, and are tests that can be used in the screening or diagnosis and/or detection of diseases, conditions or infections, including, without limitation, the presence of certain chemicals, genetic or other biomarkers. 
-16-

Medical devices to be commercially distributed in the United States must receive from the FDA either clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), or premarket approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, pursuant to the FDC Act prior to marketing, unless subject to an exemption. Devices deemed to pose relatively low risk are placed in either Class I or II. Placement of a device into Class II generally requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) seeking clearance for commercial distribution; this is known as the 510(k) clearance process. Class III devices that were on the market before May 28, 1976 and for which FDA has not yet required submission of PMAs are also required to submit a 510(k) to FDA. Most Class I devices are exempted from this premarket submission requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices and some diagnostic tests, are placed into Class III requiring PMA approval. Devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device or novel devices for which no predicate device exists are placed into Class III, but may be reclassified by FDA into Class I or Class II upon the submission by the manufacturer of a de novo reclassification application. A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application or de novo application, and in many cases is required for a 510(k) application. All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with applicable FDA or Institutional Review Board, or IRB, regulations.
510(k) Clearance Pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating to the FDA’s satisfaction that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and in technological characteristics to a previously 510(k) cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of PMA applications. The previously cleared device is known as a predicate. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from six to 12 months, but it can take significantly longer, particularly for a novel type of product. The FDA will also not begin a substantive review of the filing until it verifies the application contains all necessary information required to commence a substantive review. If the application does not contain all required information, the FDA will not file the application and return it to the submitter, highlighting the deficiencies in the application.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the agency may require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. If the modified device has been commercialized, the FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
PMA Approval Pathway. The PMA approval pathway requires a demonstration of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. The PMA approval pathway is costly, lengthy and uncertain.
A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data and also information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, which impose stringent testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
Upon submission, the FDA determines if the PMA application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, and, if so, the application is accepted for filing. The FDA then commences an in-depth review of the PMA application. The PMA approval process typically takes one to three years, but may last longer. The review time is often significantly extended as a result of the FDA asking for more information or clarification of information already provided. The FDA also may respond with a “not approvable” determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical studies that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years. During the review period for a new type of device, an FDA advisory committee, a panel of external experts, likely will be convened to review the application and recommend to the FDA whether, or upon what conditions, the device should be approved. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendation is important to the FDA’s overall decision making process.
If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an “approvable letter” requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA application. Once the approvable letter is satisfied, the FDA will issue an approval for specific indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the manufacturer. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, post-approval studies and restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval or placement of restrictions on the sale of the device until the conditions are satisfied.
Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA may require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.

De Novo Pathway. If no predicate can be identified, the product is automatically classified as Class III, requiring a PMA. However, the FDA can reclassify, or use “de novo classification” for, a device for which there was no predicate device if the device is low or moderate risk. A device company can submit a de novo application at the outset, rather than submitting a 510(k) application for its particular product. When granting a de novo application the FDA will establish special controls that other applicants for the same device type must satisfy, which often includes labeling restrictions and data requirements. Subsequent applicants can rely upon the de novo product as a predicate for a 510(k) clearance. The de novo route has been used for many in vitro diagnostic products.
Postmarket. After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the quality manufacturing requirements set forth in the QSR, labeling regulations, the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off label” uses, registration and listing, the Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulation (which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act).
The FDA enforces these requirements by unannounced inspection, market surveillance, and other means. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an untitled regulatory letter or a warning letter, to more severe sanctions such as fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and criminal prosecution. For additional information, see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Government Regulation and Diagnostic Product Reimbursement.”
Products Labeled for Research Use Only. In essence, RUO products are not regulated as medical devices and are therefore not subject to the regulatory requirements enforced by the FDA. The products must bear the statement: “For Research Use Only. Not for Use in Diagnostic Procedures.” RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility, and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance on products labeled RUO, which, among other things, reaffirmed that a company may not make any clinical or diagnostic claims about an RUO product. The FDA will also evaluate the totality of the circumstances to determine if the product is intended for diagnostic purposes. If FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that our products labeled and marketed for RUO are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be considered medical devices that will require clearance or approval prior to commercialization.
Dual-Use Instruments. Dual-use instruments are subject to FDA regulation since they are intended, at least in part, for use by customers performing clinical diagnostic testing. In November 2014, FDA issued a guidance that described FDA’s approach to regulating molecular diagnostic instruments that combine in a single molecular instrument both approved/cleared device functions and device functions for which approval/clearance is not required.
Laboratory Developed Tests. Laboratory Developed Tests, or LDTs, are developed, validated and used within a single laboratory. In the past, the FDA generally exercised its enforcement discretion for LDTs and did not require clearance or approval prior to marketing. On October 3, 2014, FDA issued two draft guidances that proposed to actively regulate LDTs using a risk-based approach, and would have required 510(k)s or PMAs for certain “moderate” or “high” risk devices. However, in late November 2016, FDA announced that it would not be finalizing the 2014 draft LDT Guidances.
Companion Diagnostics. In August 2014, FDA issued a companion diagnostics final guidance stating that if the device is essential to the safety or efficacy of the drug, FDA will generally require approval or clearance for the device at the time when FDA approves the drug. Most companion diagnostics will require PMA approval.
International
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The European Commission is the legislative body responsible for directives under which manufacturers selling medical products in the European Union, or EU, and the European Economic Area, or EEA, must comply. The EU includes most of the major countries in Europe, while other countries, such as Switzerland, are part of the EEA and have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the EU with respect to medical devices. The EU has adopted directives that address regulation of the design, manufacture, labeling, clinical studies and post-market vigilance for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the EU and EEA.
In September 2012, Prosigna was CE-marked for compliance with IVDD 98/79/EC for use in conjunction with a diagnostic version of our nCounter Analysis System in the EU to assess a breast cancer patient's risk of distant recurrence.

Outside of the EU, regulatory approval needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order to market medical devices. Although there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards, regulations in each country may vary substantially, which can affect timelines of introduction.
Reimbursement
Our nCounter FLEX Analysis Systems are purchased or leased by clinical laboratories, which use our diagnostic products as the basis for testing patients’ samples. These customers can use our products to enable commercial testing services, and generate revenue for their laboratories for this service. In order to collect payment for testing services based upon our diagnostic products, our clinical laboratory customers may bill third parties, including public and private payors. The demand for our diagnostic products will depend indirectly upon the ability for our customers to successfully bill for and receive reimbursement from third-party payors for the clinical testing services based on our products. Therefore, we intend to work with third-party payors in markets where we intend to sell our diagnostic products to ensure that testing services based on our products are covered and paid.
The decision of payors to cover and pay for a specific testing service is driven by many factors, including:

• | strong clinical and analytical validation data;


• | acceptance into major clinical guidelines, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, the American Society of Clinical Oncologists, or ASCO, and the St. Gallen Consensus guidelines;


• | health economic studies that may indicate that the test improves quality-adjusted survival and leads to reduced costs; and


• | decision impact studies that show the test leads to better treatment decisions.

We have generated dossiers for submission to payors in support of reimbursement for testing services based upon our initial diagnostic product, Prosigna. The dossiers typically contain data from studies supporting the analytical and clinical validity of Prosigna, as well as health economic analyses that examine whether the clinical information supplied by Prosigna changes medical practice in a way that leads to benefit for both the patients and the payors. In some cases, these health economic analyses may be supported by the results of clinical studies of Prosigna’s impact on adjuvant treatment decisions in early stage breast cancer called decision impact studies. We developed a clinical protocol for Prosigna decision impact studies in collaboration with two European cooperative groups, and based on this protocol we have completed three studies to date.
United States
In the United States, clinical laboratory revenue is derived from various third-party payors, including insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, and government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Clinical laboratory testing services are paid through various methodologies when covered by third-party payors, such as prospective payment systems and fee schedules. For any new clinical test, payment for the clinical laboratory service requires a decision by the third-party payor to cover the particular test, the establishment of a reimbursement rate for the test and the identification of one or more Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes that accurately describe the test.
The American Medical Association, or AMA, has issued a set of CPT codes for billing and reimbursement of complex genomic tests that are based on information from multiple analytes or genes. These new MAAA, or Multianalyte Assays with Algorithmic Analyses, codes are intended to capture tests such as Prosigna and are divided into two categories of unique codes. Category 1 MAAA codes are intended for tests that AMA’s CPT Editorial Panel has vetted and found to meet a certain set of criteria, such as demonstrated clinical validity and utility, as well as current national utilization thresholds. MAAA codes issued to complex genomic tests that have not met all Category 1 coding criteria are referred to as administrative MAAA codes. Assignment of either unique reimbursement code to a particular test may facilitate claims processing by payors; however, assignment of a unique reimbursement code alone does not guarantee favorable reimbursement decisions by payors. A genomic test with an assigned MAAA code must still be vetted and approved by individual payors for coverage and payment before reimbursement is achieved. Given the more stringent requirements for receipt of a Category 1 MAAA, including demonstrated clinical validity and utility and satisfaction of national utilization thresholds, we believe that certain payors may more readily render favorable reimbursement decisions for genomic tests with a Category 1 MAAA rather than an administrative MAAA.
In October 2016, we applied for and received a Category 1 MAAA code for Prosigna. The code was published in the CPT code book in late August 2017, with an effective date of January 1, 2018.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which provide health care to almost one in every three Americans. For any particular geographic region, Medicare claims are processed at the local level by Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs. New diagnostic tests typically follow one of three routes to coverage via CMS: National Coverage Determinations, or NCDs, Local Coverage Determinations, or LCDs, or simply payment of claims by a MAC. The NCD applies to Medicare beneficiaries living throughout the United States. Due to 
-19-

cost and CMS bandwidth limitations there are generally few NCDs. The LCD process applies to only beneficiaries in the coverage area of a single MAC, requiring multiple LCDs to cover the testing throughout the United States. Due to the cost of developing an LCD, contractors tend to develop a relatively small number and prefer to tacitly cover services by paying claims. There is also a subset of NCDs known as Coverage with Evidence Development, or CED, that allow a technology (service or procedure) to be covered while evidence of clinical utility is collected through a registry or a study to answer outstanding questions on outcomes. Some MACs have developed Coverage with Data Development, or CDD, policies for the same purpose, which are administered at the local level.
Over the past three years, we have pursued Medicare coverage for Prosigna by working with MACs to obtain favorable LCDs. In 2016, Prosigna achieved Medicare coverage in all 50 states through this process.
For Medicare, the reimbursement rates for individual tests are established under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (local fee schedules for outpatient clinical laboratory services) or the Physician Fee Schedule, depending on the amount of physician work involved in the test. Molecular diagnostic tests, such as Prosigna, are paid under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. For additional information, see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Government Regulation and Diagnostic Product Reimbursement.”
With respect to private insurance coverage, we have made significant progress in obtaining third-party reimbursement for the use of tests that incorporate new technology, such as Prosigna. Over the past three years, we have pursued coverage with all of the large private payers to facilitate reimbursement of Prosigna testing. In 2016, coverage policies were adopted by Cigna and Aetna and, in early 2017, Humana adopted a positive coverage policy. Additionally, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield, or BCBS, Association Evidence Street recently published a positive assessment of Prosigna. Most individual BCBS entities have updated their coverage policies to include Prosigna based on this evaluation.
Outside the United States
In Europe, governments are primarily responsible for reimbursing diagnostic testing services. A relatively small portion of the market is made up of private payors and cash-pay patients. The primary barrier of adoption of a new in vitro diagnostic test is often reimbursement, and public reimbursement can take several years to achieve, depending on the country. Public reimbursement for genomic testing for breast cancer is available in Canada, Ireland, France, Greece, Switzerland, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Selected private coverage for testing is available in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France, the UAE and Hungary. Reimbursement approval in some countries, such as Spain and Italy, is managed at the regional level. Israel is a market in which genomic testing for breast cancer is widely reimbursed by all four major Sick Funds, the third-party payors that cover a substantial majority of the population.
Our market access approach in Europe is similar to that in the United States and involves data driving clinical and economic publications to support guideline inclusion. Initially, we have targeted the private and cash pay market in Europe. In parallel, we are seeking to establish public reimbursement of Prosigna by national and regional governments in Europe.
Other Regulations
Our operations in the United States and abroad are subject to various fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal anti-kickback statute and state and federal marketing compliance laws in the United States. These laws may impact our operations directly, or indirectly through our customers, and may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following federal laws and their counterparts at the state level:

• | the Federal Anti-kickback Law and state anti-kickback prohibitions;


• | the Federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, and state equivalents;


• | the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended;


• | the Medicare civil money penalty and exclusion requirements;


• | the Federal False Claims Act civil and criminal penalties and state equivalents;


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which applies to our international activities;


• | the Physician Payment Sunshine Act; and


• | the European Union's General Data Privacy Regulations, or GDPR.

Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 476 employees, of which 115 work in manufacturing, 141 in sales, marketing and business development, 173 in research and development, and 47 in general and administrative. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2018, of our 476 employees, 432 were employed in the United States and 44 were employed outside the United States.
Environmental Matters
Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subject us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.
