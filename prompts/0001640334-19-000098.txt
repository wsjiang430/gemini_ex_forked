ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
HPQS is an essential primary material for the manufacture of: Photo-Voltaic (PV) solar panels; Semiconductors; all High-end Electronic products; Fiber Optical cables; Halogen Lamps; HD and LCD television screens; and Epoxy Mounding Compounds (EMC).
 
We are currently seeking capital to build a Stage One pre-processing plant to upgrade the HPQ to be salable as feedstock for numerous high-tech applications. We plan to build that plant in Townsville, Queensland, Australia, near the mine site, and a major port city where the upgraded product can easily be shipped to any user in the world. The current estimated cost of the facility, plus operating capital, is approximately $10 million to both build and equip. Upon completion, that facility will be able to upgrade the raw quartz to a High Purity Quartz Sand (HPQS) purity level that meets significant world-wide demand for use in the manufacture of PV Solar Panels, Semiconductors and all high-end electronics.
 
Following the establishment of the pre-processing plant, we plan to build a further upgrading (Stage Two) facility to upgrade the feedstock SQS from the pre-processing facility to HPQS, the highest quality quartz sand necessary for the manufacture of PV solar panels and high-end electronics, fiber optics, semiconductors and microchips. That facility will cost an additional $28 million to construct and to equip with necessary equipment including a “clean room” and commercial scale processing equipment. HPQS is an essential material for this process and the essential solar crucibles, as it shares the same element (Si “silicon”) and is almost non-reactive, assuring high quality silicon ingots. Apart from this, High Purity Quartz (HPQ) also finds primary applications in advanced lighting, telecom, optic and microelectronics industries. HPQS Powers are required for epoxy molding compound (EMC) used in manufacture of most semiconductors, and the fast-growing auto electronics sector. 
 
Active discussions with potential end user investor partners who can provide the funding for both facilities are ongoing.
 
On October 6, 2018 Graphene & Solar Technologies Limited (formerly known as Solar Quartz Technologies Corporation) signed a Joint Venture Agreement with Nanographene, Inc., a New York based graphene manufacturer and applications developer. The Joint Venture will research, evaluate and develop new combination materials of graphene and silicon-based materials and applications not presently in existence.
