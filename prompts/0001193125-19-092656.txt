ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General 
 We are a leading company in developing and commercializing high temperature superconductor (HTS) materials and related technologies. Superconductivity is the unique ability to conduct electricity with little or no resistance when cooled to critical temperatures. HTS materials are a family of elements that demonstrate superconducting properties at temperatures significantly warmer than previous superconducting materials. Electric currents that flow through conventional conductors encounter resistance. This resistance requires power to overcome and generates heat. HTS materials can substantially improve the performance characteristics of electrical systems, reduce power loss, and lower heat generation providing extremely high current carrying density and zero resistance to direct current. 
 We were established in 1987 shortly after the discovery of HTS materials. Our stated objective was to develop products based on these materials for the commercial marketplace. 
 After analyzing the market opportunities available, we decided to develop products for the utility and telecommunications industries. 
 Our initial product was completed in 1998 and we began delivery to a number of wireless network providers. In the following 13 years, we continued to refine and improve the platform, with the primary focus on improving reliability, increasing performance and runtime, and most importantly, removing cost from the manufacturing process of the required subsystems. Our cost reducing efforts led to the invention of our proprietary, high-yield and high throughput HTS material deposition manufacturing process. 
 In late 2010, we transitioned our research and development efforts to adapting our proprietary HTS material deposition techniques to the production of our HTS Conductus® wire for next generation power applications, which is our primary opportunity to grow our future revenues. 
 In November 2016, we were selected as the prime recipient of the $4.5 million program award provided by the U.S. Department of Energys (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), on behalf of the Advanced Manufacturing Office, for its Next Generation Electric Machines (NGEM) program and, in June 2017, the related contract was finalized and we have commenced work under that contract. See Other Assets and Investments below. 
 In early 2018, we announced the concentration of our future Conductus wire product development efforts on NGEM to capitalize on several accelerating energy megatrends. This refined focus is very synergistic with our program with the Department of Energy (DOE) award for the development of superconducting wire to enable NGEM. 
 Our Proprietary Technology 
 Our development efforts over the last 30 years have yielded an extensive patent portfolio as well as critical trade secrets, unpatented technology and proprietary knowledge. We have an extensive patent portfolio in addition to critical trade secrets, unpatented technology and proprietary knowledge. In June 2016, we were awarded U.S. Patent No. 9,362,025 from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) further protecting our unique capabilities for improving the performance of our Conductus superconducting wire in applications that utilize the advantages for operating in the presence of high magnetic field. In February 2017 we were awarded two patents from the USPTO: U.S. Patent No. 9,564,258, associated with U.S. Patent No. 9,362,025, providing additional protection for the foundation from which we will build high performance wire for our customers, and U.S. Patent No. 9,567,661 protecting the system design developed by STI to improve monitoring efficiency when

  evaporating materials in vacuum. In July 2017, EU patent 2188495 (08797906.8) was granted, this patent follows the U.S. Patent granted by U.S. 8,607,560. This patent is focused on METHOD FOR CENTERING RECIPROCATING BODIES AND STRUCTURES MANUFACTURED THEREWITH, related to our Sapphire Cryocooler. Our current patents expire at various dates from 2019 to 2034. We enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, suppliers and consultants to protect our proprietary information. 
 Our strategic plan is to utilize our core proprietary technology in superconductivity and leverage our proprietary manufacturing processes to build Conductus wire for use in electrical power devices, including NGEM and tokamak fusion devices. As discussed above, we are adapting our unique HTS material deposition techniques to produce our energy efficient, cost-effective and high performance Conductus wire technology for next generation power applications. We have identified three energy market megatrends that can be addressed by superconducting wire: decentralized renewable energy, high energy efficiency and sustainable transportation. We are working with leading industry device manufacturers to complete qualification and acceptance testing of Conductus wire. Our plan is for significant commercial production of Conductus wire following completion of qualification orders. 
 Our development efforts (including those described under Our Future Business below) can take a significant number of years to commercialize, and we must overcome significant technical barriers and deal with other significant risks, some of which are set out in our public filings, including in particular the Risk Factors included in Item 1A of this Report. 
 Our Future Business 
 We have created several unique capabilities and HTS manufacturing systems related to our Conductus wire platform that we are seeking to produce by leveraging our leadership in superconducting technologies, extensive intellectual property and HTS manufacturing expertise. 
HTS Wire Platform 
 Our Conductus wire products are used in large markets where the advantages of HTS wire are recognized. Our product roadmap currently focuses on superconducting high field magnets used in tokamak fusion devices, including those used in next generation electrical machines (NGEM). Other potential targets for our technology include superconducting high power transmission cable, and superconducting fault current limiters (SFCL). 
Our Current Product Focus 
 Superconducting High Field magnets: 
 There are a variety of applications that utilize superconducting magnets in order to capitalize on their unique ability to create extremely high magnetic fields. The NMR and MRI machines of today utilize such superconducting magnets for this very reason. Currently, high-field superconducting magnets are manufactured using commercially available superconducting wire such as niobium-titanium (NbTi) or niobium-tin (Nb3Sn). NMR and MRI device manufacturers and manufacturers of other NGEM look towards advances in superconducting technologies to improve the overall performance of their systems by dramatically increasing the magnetic fields while reducing size. In fusion science, the leading state-of-the art tokamak, a device which uses a powerful magnetic field to confine a hot plasma has been limited to NbTi and Nb3Sn material. High demand for a robust, high performance and low cost superconducting wire has spurred rapid development of a next generation alternative. In the last 10 years, new second generation (2G) Rare Earth, Barium, Copper Oxide (ReBCO) superconducting materials have been proven to drastically increase magnetic field strengths, especially at low temperatures. These advanced ReBCO based superconductors now provide an excellent alternative to NbTi and Nb3Sn based materials.

 Other Potential Targets For Our Technology 
 Superconducting High Power Transmission Cable: 
 Superconducting high power transmission and distribution cable transmit 5 to 10 times the electrical current of traditional copper or aluminum cables with significantly improved efficiency. HTS power cable systems consist of the cable, which is comprised of 100s of strands of HTS wire wrapped around a copper core, and the cryogenic cooling system to maintain proper operating conditions. HTS power cables are particularly suited to high load areas such as the dense urban business districts of large cities, where purchases of easements and construction costs for traditional low capacity cables may be cost prohibitive. The primary application for HTS cables is medium voltage feeds to load pockets in dense urban areas. In these high demand zones the grid is often saturated with aging infrastructure. HTS technology brings a considerable amount of power to new locations where the construction of additional transmission to distribution substations, with major transformer assets, is not feasible. Another potential use of HTS power cable is to improve grid power transmission by connecting two existing substations. In dense urban environments many substations often reach capacity limits and require redundant transformer capacity to improve reliability. HTS cables can tie these existing stations together, avoiding very costly transformer upgrades and construction costs. 
Superconducting Fault Current Limiter (SFCL): 
 With power demand on the rise and new power generation sources being added, the grid has become overcrowded and vulnerable to catastrophic faults. Faults are abnormal flows of electrical current like a short circuit. As the grid is stressed, faults and power blackouts increase in frequency and severity. SFCLs act like powerful surge protectors, preventing harmful faults from taking down substation equipment by reducing the fault current to a safer level (20  50% reduction) so that the existing switchgear can still protect the grid. Currently, electrical-utilities use massive 80kA circuit breakers, oversized transformers and fuses to prevent faults from damaging their equipment and protecting against surges. However, once a fault has occurred, standard circuit breakers suffer destructive failure and need to be replaced before service can be restored. In addition, Smart Grid and embedded alternative energy generation enhancements will increase the need for SCFLs. Grid operators face a major challenge in moving power safely and efficiently, from generators to consumers, through several stages of voltage transformation step downs and step ups. At each stage, valuable energy is lost in the form of waste heat. Moreover, while demands are continually rising, space for transformers and substations  especially in dense urban areas  is severely limited. Conventional oil-cooled transformers pose a fire and environmental hazard. Compact, efficient superconducting transformers, by contrast, are cooled by safe, abundant and environmentally benign liquid nitrogen. As an additional benefit, these actively-cooled devices will offer the capability of operating in overload, to twice the nameplate rating, without any loss of life to meet occasional utility peak load demands. 
Other Assets and Investments 
 In November 2016, we were selected as the prime recipient of the $4.5 million program award provided by the U.S. Department of Energys Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, on behalf of the Advanced Manufacturing Office, for its Next Generation Electric Machines (NGEM) program. We are collaborating in this program with TECO-Westinghouse Motor Company, an industry leading manufacturer of electric generators and motors, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of North Texas. The combined team will focus on improving the manufacturing process of superconductive wires to improve performance and yield while reducing cost at high enough temperatures where nitrogen can be used as the cryogenic fluid. Advancing these enabling technologies has the potential to boost the competitiveness of American manufacturers and take the development of more efficient electric machines a giant step further. These technology R&D projects aim to significantly improve industrial motors for manufacturing, helping companies who use these motors in manufacturing save energy and money over the long run. 
 In September 2014, STI and Robinson Research Institute entered a strategic agreement to jointly engage end customers and partners in the building of superconductor products utilizing our Conductus superconducting wire

  and Robinson Research Institutes superconducting device technology. The Robinson Research Institute, based at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, has unique capabilities in the production of HTS Roebel cable used in superconducting machines and magnets, and in the development of HTS MRI and HTS transformers. The Robinson Research Institute has been a valuable ally as we prepare for the commercial launch of Conductus wire; Robinsons performance characterization expertise and applications knowledge are truly impressive. Robinson is an expert in the development of innovative superconducting products. Jointly, we have identified initial projects including applications such as rotating machines, transformers, scientific magnets and MRI systems. Additionally, Robinson and its partners have a strong focus on Asia and we believe our agreement will help us expand our reach into that fast-growing market. Working alongside many industry leaders, the Robinson Research Institute and its partners have built superconducting devices for the energy industry, recently completing a transformer for use in the electrical grid. In the healthcare market, Robinson has focused on applications of MRI systems where HTS wire gives a competitive advantage. 
 In 2007, we formed a joint venture with Hunchun BaoLi Communication Co. Ltd. (BAOLI) for the purpose of manufacturing and selling our SuperLink interference elimination solution in China. The joint venture was subsequently terminated prior to our joint venture partner and us providing our capital and technology contributions and our obligations were terminated. 
 Licenses 
 We grant licenses for our technology to other companies. We have granted licenses to, among others, (1) Bruker for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance application, (2) General Dynamics for government applications, (3) Star Cryoelectronics for Superconducting Quantum Interference Device applications and (4) Theva for network infrastructure wireless electronic devices. 
Government Contracts 
 For 2018 and 2017, government related contracts accounted for 100% and 98%, respectively, of our revenues. Going forward, as we focus our efforts on production of our Conductus wire for next generation power applications, we expect these contract revenues to be a less significant part of our revenues. 
Manufacturing 
 Our manufacturing process involves the operation of sophisticated production equipment and material handling by production technicians. We purchase inventory components and manufacture inventory based on existing customer purchase requests, and to a lesser extent, on sales forecasts. Our Austin, Texas facility addresses our growth expectations for our superconducting wire initiative. The opening of this facility coincided with the delivery of our first superconducting wire production equipment in early 2012. Sales of our Conductus wire are expected to increase as we move to commercial production of Conductus wire following completion of qualification orders. 
 A number of components used in our products are available from only a limited number of outside suppliers due to unique designs, as well as certain quality and performance requirements. We do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with any of these suppliers, do not maintain an extensive inventory of parts or components and customarily purchase sole or limited source parts and components pursuant to purchase orders. Our reliance on sole or limited source suppliers involves certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and some of which are set out in our public filings, including in particular the Risk Factors included in Item 1A of this Report. 
 Marketing and Sales 
 We utilize a direct selling model due to the concentrated customer base for superconducting wire.
