ITEM 1. BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Avista Corp., incorporated in the territory of Washington in 1889, is primarily an electric and natural gas utility with certain other business ventures. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 1,766 people in our Pacific Northwest utility operations (Avista Utilities) and 260 people in our subsidiary businesses (including our Juneau, Alaska utility operations). Our corporate headquarters are in Spokane, Washington, the second-largest city in Washington. Spokane serves as the business, transportation, medical, industrial and cultural hub of the Inland Northwest region (eastern Washington and northern Idaho). Regional services include government and higher education, medical services, retail trade and finance. Through our subsidiary AEL&P, we also provide electric utility services in Juneau, Alaska.
As of December 31, 2018, we have two reportable business segments as follows:

• | Avista Utilities – an operating division of Avista Corp., comprising the regulated utility operations in the Pacific Northwest. Avista Utilities provides electric distribution and transmission, and natural gas distribution services in parts of eastern Washington and northern Idaho. Avista Utilities also provides natural gas distribution service in parts of northeastern and southwestern Oregon. Avista Utilities has electric generating facilities in Washington, Idaho, Oregon and Montana. Avista Utilities also supplies electricity to a small number of customers in Montana, most of whom are employees who operate Avista Utilities' Noxon Rapids generating facility. Avista Utilities also engages in wholesale purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas as an integral part of energy resource management and its load-serving obligation.


• | AEL&P - a utility providing electric services in Juneau, Alaska that is a wholly-owned subsidiary and the primary operating subsidiary of AERC.

We have other businesses, including sheet metal fabrication, venture fund investments, real estate investments, as well as certain other investments of Avista Capital, which is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Avista Corp. These activities do not represent a reportable business segment and are conducted by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of Avista Corp.
Total Avista Corp. shareholders’ equity was $1,773.2 million as of December 31, 2018, of which $46.9 million represented our investment in Avista Capital and $106.6 million represented our investment in AERC.
See “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” and “Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for information with respect to the operating performance of each business segment (and other subsidiaries).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Economic Conditions and Utility Load Growth” for information on economic conditions in our service territory.
Electric Operations
General Avista Utilities generates, transmits and distributes electricity, serving electric customers in eastern Washington and northern Idaho and a small number of customers in Montana, most of whom are employees who operate Avista Utilities' Noxon Rapids generating facility. 
Avista Utilities generates electricity from facilities that we own and purchases capacity, energy and fuel for generation under long-term and short-term contracts to meet customer load obligations. We also sell electric capacity and energy, as well as surplus fuel in the wholesale market in connection with our resource optimization activities as described below.
As part of Avista Utilities' resource procurement and management operations in the electric business, we engage in an ongoing process of resource optimization, which involves the selection from available energy resources to serve our load obligations and the use of these resources to capture economic value through wholesale market transactions. These include sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy, fuel for electric generation, and derivative contracts related to capacity, energy, fuel and fuel transportation. Such transactions are part of the process of matching available resources with load obligations and hedging a portion of the related financial risks. In order to implement this process, we make continuing projections of:

• | electric loads at various points in time (ranging from intra-hour to multiple years) based on, among other things, estimates of customer usage and weather, historical data and contract terms, and


• | resource availability at these points in time based on, among other things, fuel choices and fuel markets, estimates of streamflows, availability of generating units, historic and forward market information, contract terms and experience.

On the basis of these projections, we make purchases and sales of electric capacity and energy, fuel for electric generation, and related derivative contracts to match expected resources to expected electric load requirements and reduce our exposure to electricity (or fuel) market price changes. The process of resource optimization involves scheduling and dispatching available resources as well as the following:

• | purchasing fuel for generation,


• | when economical, selling fuel and substituting wholesale electric purchases, and


• | other wholesale transactions to capture the value of generating resources, transmission contract rights and fuel delivery (transport) capacity contracts.

This optimization process includes entering into hedging transactions to manage risks. Transactions include both physical energy contracts and related derivative instruments, and the terms range from intra-hour up to multiple years.
Avista Utilities' generation assets are interconnected through the regional transmission system and are operated on a coordinated basis to enhance load-serving capability and reliability. We acquire both long-term and short-term transmission capacity to facilitate all of our energy and capacity transactions. We provide transmission and ancillary services in eastern Washington, northern Idaho and western Montana.
Electric Requirements
Avista Utilities' peak electric native load requirement for 2018 was 1,716 MW, which occurred on August 10, 2018. In 2017, our peak electric native load was 1,681 MW, which occurred during the winter, and in 2016, it was 1,655 MW, which also occurred during the winter.
Electric Resources
Avista Utilities has a diverse electric resource mix of Company-owned and contracted hydroelectric, thermal and wind generation facilities, and other contracts for power purchases and exchanges. As of December 31, 2018, Avista Utilities' electric generation resource mix (including contracts for power purchases) was approximately 51 percent hydroelectric, 45 percent thermal and 4 percent wind. See “Item 2. Properties” for detailed information on Company-owned generating facilities.
Hydroelectric Resources Avista Utilities owns and operates six hydroelectric projects on the Spokane River and two hydroelectric projects on the Clark Fork River. Hydroelectric generation is typically our lowest cost source per MWh of electric energy and the availability of hydroelectric generation has a significant effect on total power supply costs. Under normal streamflow and operating conditions, we estimate that we would be able to meet approximately one-half of our total average 
5


AVISTA CORPORATION

electric requirements (both retail and long-term wholesale) with the combination of our hydroelectric generation and long-term hydroelectric purchase contracts with certain PUDs in the state of Washington. Our estimate of normal annual hydroelectric generation for 2019 (including resources purchased under long-term hydroelectric contracts with certain PUDs) is 584 aMW (or 5.1 million MWhs). 
The following graph shows Avista Utilities' hydroelectric generation (in thousands of MWhs) during the year ended December 31:

(1) | Normal hydroelectric generation is determined by reference to the effect of upstream dam regulation on median natural water flow. Natural water flow is the flow of the rivers without the influence of dams, whereas regulated water flow takes into account any water flow changes from upstream dams due to releasing or holding back water. The calculation of normal varies annually due to the timing of upstream dam regulation throughout the year, as well as changes in PUD contracts.

Thermal Resources Avista Utilities owns the following thermal generating resources:

• | the combined cycle CT natural gas-fired Coyote Springs 2 located near Boardman, Oregon,


• | a 15 percent interest in a twin-unit, coal-fired boiler generating facility, Colstrip 3 & 4, located in southeastern Montana,


• | a wood waste-fired boiler generating facility known as the Kettle Falls Generating Station (Kettle Falls GS) in northeastern Washington,


• | a two-unit natural gas-fired CT generating facility, located in northeastern Spokane (Northeast CT),


• | a two-unit natural gas-fired CT generating facility in northern Idaho (Rathdrum CT), and


• | two small natural gas-fired generating facilities (Boulder Park GS and Kettle Falls CT).

Coyote Springs 2, which is operated by Portland General Electric Company, is supplied with natural gas under a combination of term contracts and spot market purchases, including transportation agreements with bilateral renewal rights.

AVISTA CORPORATION

Colstrip, which is operated by Talen Montana, is supplied with fuel from adjacent coal reserves under coal supply and transportation agreements. The current contract for coal supply extends through 2019; however, the coal mine operator is in bankruptcy and has indicated it will reject the current contract in its bankruptcy. The Colstrip co-owners are exploring their options in the bankruptcy court, and have filed an objection to the confirmation plan. In addition, see “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis – Environmental Issues and Contingencies" for further discussion regarding environmental issues surrounding Colstrip.
The primary fuel for the Kettle Falls GS is wood waste generated as a by-product and delivered by trucks from forest industry operations within 100 miles of the plant. A combination of long-term contracts and spot purchases has provided, and is expected to meet, fuel requirements for the Kettle Falls GS.
The Northeast CT, Rathdrum CT, Boulder Park GS and Kettle Falls CT generating units are primarily used to meet peaking electric requirements. We also operate these facilities when marginal costs are below prevailing wholesale electric prices. These generating facilities have access to natural gas supplies that are adequate to meet their respective operating needs.
See "Item 2. Properties - Avista Utilities - Generation Properties" for the nameplate rating and present generating capabilities of the above thermal resources.
We have the exclusive rights to all the capacity of the Lancaster Plant, a 270 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle combustion turbine plant located in northern Idaho, owned by an unrelated third-party. All of the output from the Lancaster Plant is contracted to us through 2026 under a PPA. Under the terms of the PPA, we make the dispatch decisions, provide all natural gas fuel and receive all of the electric energy output from the Lancaster Plant; therefore, we consider this plant in our baseload resources. See "Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of this PPA.

The following graph shows Avista Utilities' thermal generation (in thousands of MWhs) during the year ended December 31:
Wind Resources We have exclusive rights to all the capacity of Palouse Wind, a wind generation project developed, owned and managed by an unrelated third-party and located in Whitman County, Washington. The PPA expires in 2042 and requires us to acquire all of the power and renewable attributes produced by the project at a fixed price per MWh with a fixed escalation of the price over the term of the agreement. The project has a nameplate capacity of 105 MW. Generation from Palouse Wind was 327,172 MWhs in 2018, 300,380 MWhs in 2017 and 349,771 MWhs in 2016. We have an annual option to purchase the wind project beginning in December 2022. The purchase price is a fixed price per KW of in-service capacity with a fixed decline in 
7


AVISTA CORPORATION

the price per KW over the remaining 20-year term of the PPA. Under the terms of the PPA, we do not have any input into the day-to-day operation of the project, including maintenance decisions. All such rights are held by the owner.
Solar Resources We have exclusive rights to all the capacity of the Lind Solar Farm, a solar generation project developed, owned and managed by an unrelated third-party and located in Lind, Washington. The PPA expires in 2038 and requires us to acquire all the power and renewable attributes produced by the project at a fixed price per MWh. The project has a nameplate capacity of 28 MW. The facility became operational in the fourth quarter of 2018 and generated 584 MWhs in 2018. Under the terms of the PPA, we do not have any input into the day-to-day operation of the project, including maintenance decisions. All such rights are held by the owner. In addition to the Lind Solar Farm, we also own a community solar array located in Spokane Valley, Washington with a nameplate capacity of 0.4 MW. The community solar array generated 538 MWhs during 2018.
Other Purchases, Exchanges and Sales In addition to the resources described above, we purchase and sell power under various long-term contracts, and we also enter into short-term purchases and sales. Further, pursuant to The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended, we are required to purchase generation from qualifying facilities. This includes, among other resources, hydroelectric projects, cogeneration projects and wind generation projects at rates approved by the WUTC and the IPUC. 
See “Avista Utilities Electric Operating Statistics – Electric Operations” below for annual quantities of purchased power, wholesale power sales and power from exchanges in 2018, 2017 and 2016. See “Electric Operations” above for additional information with respect to the use of wholesale purchases and sales as part of our resource optimization process and also see "Future Resource Needs" below for the magnitude of these power purchase and sales contracts in future periods.
Hydroelectric Licenses
Avista Corp. is a licensee under the Federal Power Act (FPA) as administered by the FERC, which includes regulation of hydroelectric generation resources. Excluding the Little Falls Hydroelectric Generating Project (Little Falls), our other seven hydroelectric plants are regulated by the FERC through two project licenses. The licensed projects are subject to the provisions of Part I of the FPA. These provisions include payment for headwater benefits, condemnation of licensed projects upon payment of just compensation, and take-over by the federal government of such projects after the expiration of the license upon payment of the lesser of “net investment” or “fair value” of the project, in either case, plus severance damages. In the unlikely event that a take-over occurs, it could lead to either the decommissioning of the hydroelectric project or offering the project to another party (likely through sale and transfer of the license).
Cabinet Gorge and Noxon Rapids are under one 45-year FERC license issued in 2001. See “Cabinet Gorge Total Dissolved Gas Abatement Plan” in “Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of dissolved atmospheric gas levels that exceed state of Idaho and federal numeric water quality standards downstream of Cabinet Gorge during periods when we must divert excess river flows over the spillway, as well as our mitigation plans and efforts.
Five of our six hydroelectric projects on the Spokane River (Long Lake, Nine Mile, Upper Falls, Monroe Street and Post Falls) are under one 50-year FERC license issued in 2009 and are referred to collectively as the Spokane River Project. The sixth, Little Falls, is operated under separate Congressional authority and is not licensed by the FERC.
Future Resource Needs
Avista Utilities has operational strategies to provide sufficient resources to meet our energy requirements under a range of operating conditions. These operational strategies consider the amount of energy needed, which varies widely because of the factors that influence demand over intra-hour, hourly, daily, monthly and annual durations. Our average hourly load was 1,034 aMW in 2018, 1,070 aMW in 2017 and 1,033 aMW in 2016.

AVISTA CORPORATION

The following graph shows our forecast of our average annual energy requirements and our available resources for 2019 through 2022:

(1) | The contracts for power sales decrease due to certain contracts expiring in each of these years. We are evaluating the future plan for the additional resources made available due to the expiration of these contracts.


(2) | The forecast assumes near normal hydroelectric generation.


(3) | Includes the Lancaster Plant PPA. Excludes Boulder Park GS, Kettle Falls CT, Northeast CT and Rathdrum CT, as these are considered peaking facilities and are generally not used to meet our base load requirements.


(4) | Other contracts for power purchases includes power purchase agreements for solar and wind energy.


(5) | The combined maximum capacity of Boulder Park GS, Kettle Falls CT, Northeast CT and Rathdrum CT is 278 MW, with estimated available energy production as indicated for each year.

In August 2017, we filed our 2017 Electric IRP with the WUTC and the IPUC. The WUTC and IPUC review the IRPs and give the public the opportunity to comment. The WUTC and IPUC do not approve or disapprove of the content in the IRPs; rather they acknowledge that the IRPs were prepared in accordance with applicable standards if that is the case. The IRP details projected growth in demand for energy and the new resources needed to serve customers over the next 20 years. We regard the IRP as a tool for resource evaluation, rather than an acquisition plan for a particular project.
Highlights of the 2017 IRP include the following expectations and/or assumptions:

• | Our current generation resources will remain cost effective and reliable sources of power to meet future customer needs over the next 20 years.


• | Energy storage costs are significantly lower than those assumed in the 2015 IRP, which, for the first time, makes the energy storage technology operationally attractive in meeting energy needs in the 20-year timeframe of the 2017 IRP.


• | A power purchase agreement for a solar facility with at least 15 MW for our new Solar Select Program for commercial and industrial customers.


• | Conservation will effectively provide 53 percent of the requirements of future load growth.


• | Colstrip will remain a cost effective and reliable source of power to meet future customer needs.

We are required to file an electric IRP every two years. We filed petitions with the WUTC and IPUC in January 2019 to extend the current electric IRP from August 31, 2019 to February 28, 2020 because of the uncertainty created by the current legislative energy proposals in Washington. The WUTC approved our petition in February 2019. We expect the IPUC to approve our 
9


AVISTA CORPORATION

petition during the first quarter 2019. Our resource strategy may change from the 2017 IRP based on market, legislative and regulatory developments.
We are subject to the Washington state Energy Independence Act, which requires us to obtain a portion of our electricity from qualifying renewable resources or through purchase of RECs and acquiring all cost effective conservation measures. Future generation resource decisions will be affected by legislation for restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy requirements.
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition – Environmental Issues and Contingencies” for information related to existing laws, as well as potential legislation that could influence our future electric resource mix.
Natural Gas Operations
General Avista Utilities provides natural gas distribution services to retail customers in parts of eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and northeastern and southwestern Oregon.
Market prices for natural gas, like other commodities, can be volatile. Our natural gas procurement strategy is to provide a reliable supply to our customers with some level of price certainty. We procure natural gas from various supply basins and over varying time periods. The resulting portfolio is a diversified mix of forward fixed price purchases, index and spot market purchases, utilizing physical and financial derivative instruments. We also use natural gas storage to support high demand periods and to procure natural gas when prices may be lower. Securing prices throughout the year and even into subsequent years provides a level of price certainty and can mitigate price volatility to customers between years.
Weather is a key component of our natural gas customer load. This load is highly variable and daily natural gas loads can differ significantly from the monthly forecasted load projections. We make continuing projections of our natural gas loads and assess available natural gas resources. On the basis of these projections, we plan and execute a series of transactions to hedge a portion of our customers' projected natural gas requirements through forward market transactions and derivative instruments. These transactions may extend for multiple years into the future. We also leave a portion of our natural gas supply requirements unhedged for purchase in the short-term spot markets. 
Our purchase of natural gas supply is governed by our procurement plan and is reviewed and approved annually by the Risk Management Committee (RMC), which is comprised of certain officers and other management personnel. Once approval is received, the plan is implemented and monitored by our gas supply and risk management groups.
The plan’s progress is also presented to the WUTC and IPUC staff in semi-annual meetings, and updates are given to the OPUC staff quarterly. The RMC is provided with an update on plan results and changes in their monthly meetings. These activities provide transparency for the natural gas supply procurement plan. Any material changes to the plan are documented and communicated to RMC members. 
As part of the process of balancing natural gas retail load requirements with resources, we engage in the wholesale purchase and sale of natural gas. We plan for sufficient natural gas delivery capacity to serve our retail customers for a theoretical peak day event. We generally have more pipeline and storage capacity than what is needed during periods other than a peak day. We optimize our natural gas resources by using market opportunities to generate economic value that helps mitigate fixed costs. Wholesale sales are delivered through wholesale market facilities outside of our natural gas distribution system. Natural gas resource optimization activities include, but are not limited to:

• | wholesale market sales of surplus natural gas supplies,


• | purchases and sales of natural gas to optimize use of pipeline and storage capacity, and


• | participation in the transportation capacity release market.

We also provide distribution transportation service to qualified, large commercial and industrial natural gas customers who purchase natural gas through third-party marketers. For these customers, we receive their purchased natural gas from such third-party marketers into our distribution system and deliver it to the customers’ premise.
Optimization transactions that we engage in throughout the year are included in our annual purchased gas cost adjustment filings with the various commissions and are subject to review for prudence during this process.
Natural Gas Supply Avista Utilities purchases all of its natural gas in wholesale markets. We are connected to multiple supply basins in the western United States and Canada through firm capacity transportation rights on six different pipeline networks. Access to this diverse portfolio of natural gas resources allows us to make natural gas procurement decisions that benefit our 
10


AVISTA CORPORATION

natural gas customers. These interstate pipeline transportation rights provide the capacity to serve approximately 25 percent of peak natural gas customer demands from domestic sources and 75 percent from Canadian sourced supply. Natural gas prices in the Pacific Northwest are affected by global energy markets, as well as supply and demand factors in other regions of the United States and Canada. Future prices and delivery constraints may cause our resource mix to vary.
Natural Gas Storage Avista Utilities owns a one-third interest in Jackson Prairie, an underground aquifer natural gas storage field located near Chehalis, Washington. Jackson Prairie has a total peak day deliverability of 12 million therms, with a total working natural gas capacity of 256 million therms. As an owner, our share is one-third of the peak day deliverability and total working capacity. We also contract for additional storage capacity and delivery at Jackson Prairie from Northwest Pipeline for a portion of their one-third share of the storage project.
We optimize our natural gas storage capacity throughout the year by executing transactions that capture favorable market price spreads. Natural gas buyers identify opportunities to purchase lower cost natural gas in the immediate term to inject into storage, and then sell the gas in a forward market to be withdrawn at a later time. The reverse of this type of transaction also occurs. These transactions lock in incremental value for customers. Jackson Prairie is also used as a variable peaking resource, and to protect from extreme daily price volatility during cold weather or other events affecting the market.
Future Resource Needs In August 2018, we filed our 2018 Natural Gas IRP with the WUTC, the IPUC and the OPUC. The IRP details projected growth in demand for energy and the new resources needed to serve customers over the next 20 years. We regard the IRP as a tool for resource evaluation, rather than an acquisition plan for a particular project.
Highlights of the 2018 natural gas IRP include the following expectations and/or assumptions:

• | We will need no additional natural gas transportation resources during the 20-year planning horizon in Washington, Idaho, or Oregon.


• | Due to expected carbon legislation at the state levels through a cap and trade mechanism (Oregon) or a fee mechanism (Washington), we expect natural gas prices to include a carbon price adder in Oregon and Washington, but not in Idaho.


• | North American supplies of natural gas will continue to be abundant led by shale gas development.


• | Customer growth in our service territory will increase slightly compared to the 2016 IRP. There will be increasing interest from customers to utilize natural gas for heating due to its abundant supply and consequent low cost.


• | We anticipate that any increased demand for natural gas regionally will primarily come from power generation as natural gas is increasingly being used to back up solar and wind technology, and also to replace retired coal plants. There is also potential for increased usage in other markets, such as LNG exports or exports to Mexico.


• | Slightly higher customer growth will continue to be offset by lower use per customer and an increased amount of demand side management (DSM). The combination of low priced natural gas in addition to carbon fees or other programs has led to a higher potential for DSM measures as compared to the previous three IRPs.


• | The availability of natural gas in North America will continue to change global LNG dynamics. Existing and new LNG facilities will look to export low cost North American natural gas to the higher priced foreign markets. This could alter the price of natural gas and/or transportation in U.S. markets, constrain existing pipeline networks, stimulate development of new pipeline resources and change flows of natural gas across North America.

We will monitor these assumptions on an on-going basis and adjust our resource requirements accordingly.
We are required to file a natural gas IRP every two years, with the next IRP expected to be filed during the third quarter of 2020. Our resource strategy in our 2020 IRP may change from the 2018 IRP based on market, legislative and regulatory developments.
Regulatory Issues
General As a public utility, Avista Corp. is subject to regulation by state utility commissions for prices, accounting, the issuance of securities and other matters. The retail electric and natural gas operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the WUTC, IPUC, OPUC and MPSC. Approval of the issuance of securities is not required from the MPSC. We are also subject to 
11


AVISTA CORPORATION

the jurisdiction of the FERC for licensing of hydroelectric generation resources, and for electric transmission services and wholesale sales.
Since Avista Corp. is a “holding company” (in addition to being itself an operating utility), we are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, which imposes certain reporting and other requirements. We, and all of our subsidiaries (whether or not engaged in any energy related business), are required to maintain books, accounts and other records in accordance with the FERC regulations and to make them available to the FERC and the state utility commissions. In addition, upon the request of any jurisdictional state utility commission, the FERC would have the authority to review assignment of costs of non-power goods and administrative services among us and our subsidiaries. The FERC has the authority generally to require that rates subject to its jurisdiction be just and reasonable and in this context would continue to be able to, among other things, review transactions of any affiliated company.
Our rates for retail electric and natural gas services (other than specially negotiated retail rates for industrial or large commercial customers, which are subject to regulatory review and approval) are generally determined on a “cost of service” basis. 

Rates are designed to provide an opportunity for us to recover allowable operating expenses and earn a return of and a reasonable return on “rate base.” Rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost (net of accumulated depreciation) of utility plant in service, subject to various adjustments for deferred income taxes and other items. Over time, rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation and retirement of utility plant and write-offs as authorized by the utility commissions. Our operating expenses and rate base are allocated or directly assigned to five regulatory jurisdictions: electric in Washington and Idaho, and natural gas in Washington, Idaho and Oregon. In general, requests for new retail rates are made on the basis of revenues, operating expenses and net investment for a test year that ended prior to the date of the request, subject to possible adjustments, which differ among the various jurisdictions, designed to reflect the expected revenues, operating expenses and net investment during the period new retail rates will be in effect. The retail rates approved by the state commissions in a rate proceeding may not provide sufficient revenues to provide recovery of costs and a reasonable return on investment for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, ongoing capital expenditures and unexpected changes in revenues and expenses following the time new retail rates are requested in the rate proceeding, the denial by the commission of recovery, or timely recovery, of certain expenses or investment and the limitation by the commission of the authorized return on investment.
Our rates for wholesale electric and natural gas transmission services are based on either “cost of service” principles or market-based rates as set forth by the FERC. See “Notes 1, 11 and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information about regulation, depreciation and deferred income taxes.
General Rate Cases Avista Utilities regularly reviews the need for electric and natural gas rate changes in each state in which we provide service. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Regulatory Matters – General Rate Cases” for information on general rate case activity.
Power Cost Deferrals Avista Utilities defers the recognition in the income statement of certain power supply costs that vary from the level currently recovered from our retail customers as authorized by the WUTC and the IPUC. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Regulatory Matters – Power Cost Deferrals and Recovery Mechanisms” and “Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for information on power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms in Washington and Idaho.
Purchased Gas Adjustments (PGA) Under established regulatory practices in each state, Avista Utilities defers the recognition in the income statement of the natural gas costs that vary from the level currently recovered from our retail customers as authorized by each of our jurisdictions. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Regulatory Matters – Purchased Gas Adjustments” and “Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for information on natural gas cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms in Washington, Idaho and Oregon.
Decoupling Mechanisms Decoupling (also known as FCA in Idaho) is a mechanism designed to sever the link between a utility's revenues and consumers' energy usage. In each of its jurisdictions, Avista Utilities' electric and natural gas revenues are adjusted so as to be based on the number of customers in certain customer rate classes and assumed "normal" usage, rather than being based on actual usage. The difference between revenues based on the number of customers and "normal" sales and revenues based on actual usage is deferred and either surcharged or rebated to customers beginning in the following year. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Regulatory Matters – Decoupling and Earnings Sharing Mechanisms” for further discussion of these mechanisms.

Federal Laws Related to Wholesale Competition
Federal law promotes practices that foster competition in the electric wholesale energy market. The FERC requires electric utilities to transmit power and energy to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers, and requires electric utilities to enhance or construct transmission facilities to create additional transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services. Public utilities (through subsidiaries or affiliates) and other entities may participate in the development of independent electric generating plants for sales to wholesale customers.
Public utilities operating under the FPA are required to provide open and non-discriminatory access to their transmission systems to third parties and establish an Open Access Same-Time Information System to provide an electronic means by which transmission customers can obtain information about available transmission capacity and purchase transmission access. The FERC also requires each public utility subject to the rules to operate its transmission and wholesale power merchant operating functions separately and to comply with standards of conduct designed to ensure that all wholesale users, including the public utility’s power merchant operations, have equal access to the public utility’s transmission system. Our compliance with these standards has not had any substantive impact on the operation, maintenance and marketing of our transmission system or our ability to provide service to customers.
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Competition” for further information.
Regional Transmission Planning
Beginning with FERC Order No. 888 and continuing with subsequent rulemakings and policies, the FERC has encouraged better coordination and operational consistency aimed to capture efficiencies that might otherwise be gained through the formation of a Regional Transmission Organization or an independent system operator (ISO). 
Avista Utilities meets its FERC requirements to coordinate transmission planning activities with other regional entities through ColumbiaGrid. ColumbiaGrid is a Washington nonprofit membership corporation with an independent board formed to improve the operational efficiency, reliability, and planned expansion of the transmission grid in the Pacific Northwest. We became a member of ColumbiaGrid in 2006 during its formation. ColumbiaGrid is not an ISO, but fills the role of facilitating the regional transmission planning requirements of FERC Order No. 1000, and other clarifying FERC Orders, for its members. ColumbiaGrid and its members also work with other western organizations to address transmission planning, including WestConnect and the Northern Tier Transmission Group (NTTG). In 2011, we became a registered Planning Participant of the NTTG. We will continue to assess the benefits of entering into other functional agreements with ColumbiaGrid and/or participating in other forums to attain operational efficiencies and to meet FERC policy objectives.
Certain ColumbiaGrid members, including the BPA (ColumbiaGrid’s largest funding member), have commenced the process to withdraw from ColumbiaGrid by giving notice of withdrawal from the ColumbiaGrid Planning and Expansion Functional Agreement. On December 18, 2018, Avista Corp. submitted its notice of intent to withdraw from the ColumbiaGrid Planning and Expansion Functional Agreement. Unless rescinded, Avista Corp.’s withdrawal from the Planning and Expansion Functional Agreement will be effective on December 31, 2020. Avista Corp. is currently working with transmission providers from the NTTG and ColumbiaGrid to establish a new regional transmission planning organization that will facilitate regional transmission planning for Avista Corp. and other member organizations.
Regional Energy Markets
The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) operates an EIM in the western United States. Most investor-owned utilities in the Pacific Northwest are either participants in the CAISO EIM or plan to integrate into the market in the near future. The decision to join the CAISO EIM is based on a number of factors, including the amount of variable generating resources in the utilities’ systems, the ability to manage the variable generating resources within the utilities’ systems, the costs associated with joining the CAISO EIM, and the economic benefits associated with joining the CAISO EIM. As additional utilities join the CAISO EIM, there could be a reduction in bilateral market liquidity and opportunities for wholesale transactions in the Pacific Northwest. As market fundamentals and our business needs evolve, we continue to evaluate the drivers (including weighing the advantages and disadvantages) with respect to joining the CAISO EIM. We plan to refine our analyses, including cost estimates, and make a decision in 2019 with regards to participation in the EIM.
Reliability Standards
Among its other provisions, the U.S. Energy Policy Act provides for the implementation of mandatory reliability standards and authorizes the FERC to assess penalties for non-compliance with these standards and other FERC regulations.
The FERC certified the NERC as the single Electric Reliability Organization authorized to establish and enforce reliability standards and delegate authority to regional entities for the purpose of establishing and enforcing reliability standards. The

AVISTA CORPORATION

FERC approves NERC Reliability Standards, including western region standards that make up the set of legally enforceable standards for the United States bulk electric system. The first of these reliability standards became effective in 2007. From time to time new standards are developed or existing standards are updated, revised, consolidated or eliminated pursuant to an industry-involved process. We are required to self-certify our compliance with these standards on an annual basis and undergo regularly scheduled periodic reviews by the NERC and its regional entity, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC). Failure to comply with NERC reliability standards could result in financial penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. We have a robust internal compliance program in place to manage compliance activities and mitigate the risk of potential noncompliance with these standards. We do not expect the costs associated with compliance with these standards to have a material impact on our financial results.
Peak Reliability is the reliability coordinator in the Western Interconnection that performs reliability coordinator functions for its funding parties, including Avista Corp. The CAISO, which is a significant Peak Reliability funding party recently submitted its notice of withdrawal from Peak Reliability, effective September 2, 2019. After the CAISO submitted its notice of withdrawal from Peak Reliability, other funding parties, including Avista Corp., also submitted a revocable notice of withdrawal from Peak Reliability. Unless revoked, our withdrawal from Peak Reliability will be effective on December 31, 2019. We have signed an agreement to receive reliability coordination services from the CAISO. We are scheduled to transition to the CAISO for reliability coordination services in November 2019.
Vulnerability to Cyberattack
The energy sector, particularly electric and natural gas utility companies in the United States and abroad, have become the subject of cyberattacks with increased frequency. The Company’s administrative and operating networks are targeted by hackers on a regular basis.
A successful attack on the Company’s administrative networks could compromise the security and privacy of data, including operating, financial and personal information. A successful attack on the Company’s operating networks could impair the operation of the Company’s electric and/or natural gas utility facilities, possibly resulting in the inability to provide electric and/or natural gas service for extended periods of time.
The Company continually reinforces and updates its defensive systems and is in compliance with NERC’s reliability standards. See “Reliability Standards," "Item 1A. Risk Factors – Cyber and Technology Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Enterprise Risk Management – Cyber and Technology Risks” for further information.

AVISTA CORPORATION

ALASKA ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY
AEL&P is the primary operating subsidiary of AERC. AEL&P is the sole utility providing electrical energy in Juneau, Alaska. Juneau is a geographically isolated community with no electric interconnections with the transmission facilities of other utilities and no pipeline access to natural gas or other fuels. Juneau’s economy is primarily driven by government activities, tourism, commercial fishing, and mining, as well as activities as the commercial hub of southeast Alaska.
AEL&P owns and operates electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities located in Juneau. AEL&P operates five hydroelectric generation facilities with 102.7 MW of hydroelectric generation capacity as of December 31, 2018. AEL&P owns four of these generation facilities (totaling 24.5 MW of capacity) and has a PPA for the output of the Snettisham hydroelectric project (totaling 78.2 MW of capacity). 
The Snettisham hydroelectric project is owned by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA), a public corporation of the State of Alaska. AIDEA issued revenue bonds in 1998 (which were refinanced in 2015) to finance its acquisition of the project. These bonds were outstanding in the amount of $57.2 million at December 31, 2018 and mature in January 2034. AEL&P has a PPA and operating and maintenance agreement with the AIDEA to operate and maintain the facility. This PPA is a take-or-pay obligation, expiring in December 2038, to purchase all of the output of the project. AIDEA's bonds are payable solely out of the revenues received under the PPA.
For accounting purposes, this PPA is treated as a capital lease and, as of December 31, 2018, the capital lease obligation was $57.2 million. Snettisham Electric Company, a non-operating subsidiary of AERC, has the option to purchase the Snettisham project at any time for a price equal to the principal amount of the bonds outstanding at that time. See "Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of the Snettisham capital lease obligation.
As of December 31, 2018, AEL&P also had 107.5 MW of diesel generating capacity from four facilities to provide back-up service to firm customers when necessary.
The following graph shows AEL&P's hydroelectric generation (in thousands of MWhs) during the time periods indicated below:
Normal hydroelectric generation is defined as the energy output of the plant during a year with average inflows to the reservoir. Normal annual hydroelectric generation for AEL&P is approximately 430,000 MWhs.
As of December 31, 2018, AEL&P served approximately 17,000 customers. Its primary customers include city, state and federal governmental entities located in Juneau, as well as a mine located in the Juneau area. Most of AEL&P’s customers are served on a firm basis while certain of its customers, including its largest customer, are served on an interruptible sales basis. AEL&P maintains separate rate tariffs for each of its customer classes, as well as seasonal rates.

AVISTA CORPORATION

AEL&P’s operations are subject to regulation by the RCA with respect to rates, standard of service, facilities, accounting and certain other matters, but not with respect to the issuance of securities. Rate adjustments for AEL&P’s customers require approval by the RCA pursuant to RCA regulations. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis – Regulatory Matters" for further discussion of AEL&P's latest general rate case filing, including its capital structure.
AEL&P is also subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to permits and licenses necessary to operate certain of its hydroelectric facilities. One of these licenses (for the Salmon Creek and Annex Creek hydroelectric projects) was renewed for 40 years, effective September 1, 2018. Since AEL&P has no electric interconnection with other utilities and makes no wholesale sales, it is not subject to general FERC jurisdiction, other than the reporting and other requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 as an Avista Corp. subsidiary.
The Snettisham hydroelectric project is subject to regulation by the State of Alaska with respect to dam safety and certain aspects of its operations. In addition, AEL&P is subject to regulation with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters under both federal and state laws.
