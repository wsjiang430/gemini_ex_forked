Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Our business is divided into two major segments: travel agency assistance services and convention services.
 
We are a start-up company that was formed on May 11, 2015. To the present, we have engaged in formation activities, raising capital, and commencing operations. We have signed services contract with multiple travel agents to assist with hotel room price quotation and negotiation and communicating with hotels to ensure that accurate reservations are made with Chinese clientele. Through June 30, 2019, we have generated revenue from our agreement with our clients. We earned $43,639 and $86,715 in revenues for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We are also hopeful that we will engage in other contracts for the services outlined below.
 
We require additional capital necessary for us to grow our business. Our initial plans include: hiring necessary personnel, marketing our business, completing our website, purchasing equipment and software and further developing the service offering. Our business plan calls for capital of approximately $250,000 in the next twelve months. There is no assurance that we will be successful in these endeavors or that if we accomplish all of these steps we will be able to operate profitably. We intend to fulfill the service needs of our potential customers by utilizing resources and employees in the United States, but, as we grow, we believe we can reduce costs and increase margins by utilizing personnel in foreign countries, such as China, to fulfill the services on behalf of our customers.
 
Through our services, we believe that clients will be able to gain the advantage of maintaining their growth goals without the need to sacrifice precious resources to address standard business bottlenecks. Our goal is to allow firms to retain their entrepreneurial speed and agility, advantages they would otherwise sacrifice in dealing with logistics rather than the specific focus of the clients business. We plan to allow clients to grow at a faster pace as they will be less constrained by large capital expenditures for people, training, equipment, or mistakes made from lack of experience in areas which are unrelated to the clients specific business purpose.
 
Since our inception, we have been attempting to raise money to implement our business plan, and we have raised some funds lately, mostly through the sale of convertible debt, but have not been able to secure the funds necessary to fully implement our business plan. The lack of funds have prevented us from growing the business as we had hoped. As we have been unable to raise the capital necessary to develop and market our services, we have recently been engaged in a search for other business opportunities which may benefit our shareholders and allow us to raise capital and operate. Recent negotiations with what we believe is a more viable business opportunity leads us to believe that we will be revising our business plan and focus over the next quarter. If this opportunity does not develop, however, we will continue to both seek new opportunities and look for capital to further our existing business plan.
 
Travel Agency Assistance
 
We provide services for overseas travel agents on hotel price quotation and negotiation, contract reviewing, detailed guests arrangements, hotel check-in assistance and tradeshow assistance. Overseas travel agents often encounter language barriers and time differences on office hours when dealing with U.S. based hotels and U.S. based conventions. We believe that our bilingual language services, flexible office hours, and reasonable fee structure will help our clients to increase accuracy and efficiency levels, and reduce costs.
 
Currently, we service 8 overseas and domestic travel agencies. These travel agencies work with exhibition service agents or travel groups in China to coordinate the travel plans of tour groups that plan on attending exhibitions in the U.S. Depending on the event, these tour groups can range from 20 to over 700 people. It is vital for the travel agents and exhibition services agents to provide their clients - Chinese businesses who exhibit in the trade show, a seamless and worry-free trip.

Our role is to help the travel agencies communicate with hotels and convention staff timely and accurately, including finding and negotiating hotel rate, reviewing and updating contracts, submitting and revising guest lists, group check-in (pick up and sorting the room keys for different groups), communicating on bill differences, etc. We currently have bilinguals that are fluent in English and Chinese. We plan to expand our staff of bilinguals to cater to other languages and countries other than China. Our main focus at the present time is to establish a presence in China and we intend to branch out to other Asian countries from there as resources permit.
 
In November 2016, we became a certified travel agency. Additionally, we became an affiliate partner with booking.com and the Expedia TAAP program. We hope these recent events will help us increase revenue in the future.
 
Convention Services
 
Our second business segment is catering to the individual exhibitors at the exhibitions. Exhibitors/ attendees often have temporary assistance needs at conventions and trade shows. We assist these clients on booth set up, tradeshow promotion material preparing, entourage interpreter and/or exhibitor booth personnel arrangements, including bilingual spokespersons, sales associates, narrators and demonstrators, hostesses/hosts, promoters and models.
 
We are also able to provide custom and pre-made booths, booth graphic design, and exhibit booth setup services to our clients. For clients looking for complete tradeshow exhibit booths, we provide turnkey solutions for sale. We offer top of the range Tablets, TV screens with stands, tables, and chairs, storage bins among others, to ensure that your tradeshow booth is highly inviting. We are able to work with clients on their required specifications and our staff is capable of delivery and assembly of attractive booth designs.
 
We have limited clients in this business segment. We plan to utilize our travel agency and exhibition service agent contacts to reach out to these exhibitors and establish direct connections for our exhibition services. We may also work though these vital contacts as an extension of their services to these clientele. Furthermore, because we have a U.S. presence, we plan to reach out to the U.S. exhibitions to offer our services to these clientele.
 
Management, Employees and Consulting
 
We currently do not compensate our officer and director, Duan Fu. We plan to compensate him when we have enough money to do so. His main function is to oversee the entire plan of the company and engage in the day to day operations. His expertise is in design and business management. We expect that he will be instrumental in our marketing and advertising efforts. He will purchase keywords on Google AdWords to drive traffic to our website, and also purchase email lists and send bulk email to small and medium sized businesses to generate interest in our services. We do not anticipate that we will enter into an employment agreement with Mr. Duan or compensate him with significant cash in the next twelve months. We plan to provide him around $2,000 in cash monthly if and when it is available. As of June 30, 2019, we have not compensated Mr. Fu, since we want to utilize our capital on business operations and growth.
 
We have a consulting agreement with Zixiao Chen. Ms. Chen was a prior officer and director. She assisted with our formation activities and resigned shortly after our incorporation, opting for a consultant capacity with our company. In her agreement, dated July 11, 2015, we initially compensated her monthly with 60,000 shares of our common stock or $3,000. On July 1, 2017, we entered into a new consulting agreement with Ms. Chen. Her responsibilities include overseeing the business accounts, dealing with clients and expanding the companys sales efforts. She will assist with creating timelines, data entry, plans and budgets for our clients. She will also establish the training program to train new employees on delivering the services, oversee and respond to concerns with our outsourced personnel. Her agreement provides her monthly compensation in the form of 300,000 shares of common stock or $3,000, payable at our discretion. After the initial year, we are required to compensate her in cash.
 
We have a consulting agreement with Desert Skyline Resources, LLC (Desert Skyline). On July 15, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Desert Skyline to assist with business connections, marketing and business development. All amounts owed have been paid.

Competition
 
Competition in all aspects of the outsourced services and business services industry is intense. We will compete against established outsourced business services companies with name familiarity and greater financial resources. We intend to use our relatively small size to our advantage by focusing on customer service and by deploying unique marketing strategies. A large part of our effort to compete against the other companies in our field will be directed to being recognized in this market of large players and, as a small company, to gain the trust of purchasing decision makers at our potential customers. In an effort to effectively compete, we will focus heavily on providing excellent service to our customers. We also intend to compete by running cutting edge marketing campaigns that use the internet and other technologies to educate the market about our services. Competitors may seek to duplicate the benefits of our services in ways that do not infringe on any benefits that our services offer. As a result we could find that our entire marketing plan and business model is undercut or made irrelevant by actions of other companies under which we have no control. We cannot promise that we can accomplish our marketing goals and as a result may experience negative impact upon our operating results.
Regulation
 
Federal, state and international laws and regulations impose a number of requirements and restrictions on our business. There are state and federal consumer protection laws that apply to our customer management services business, such as laws limiting telephonic sales or mandating special disclosures, and laws that apply to information that may be captured, used, shared and/or retained when sales are made and/or collections are attempted. State and federal laws also impose limits on credit account interest rates and fees, and their disclosure, as well as the time frame in which judicial actions may be initiated to enforce the collection of consumer accounts. There are numerous other federal, state, local and even international laws and regulations related to, among other things, privacy, identity theft, telephonic and electronic communications, sharing and use of consumer information that apply to our business and to our employees interactions and communications with others. For example, the Federal Trade Commission's Telemarketing Sales Rule applies a number of limitations and restrictions on our ability to make outbound calls on behalf of our clients and our ability to encourage customers to purchase higher value products and services on inbound calls. Similarly, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, which among other things governs the use of certain automated calling technologies, applies to calls to customers. Many states also have telemarketing laws that may apply to our business, even if the call originates from outside the state. Additionally, some of the laws directed toward credit originators, such as the Truth in Lending Act and the Fair Credit Billing Act, can affect our operations because our receivables were originated through credit transactions. These laws, among others, may give consumers a legal cause of action against us or may limit our ability to recover amounts owed with respect to the receivables.
 
Federal and state regulators are empowered to examine and take enforcement actions for violations of these laws and regulations or for practices, policies or procedures they deem non-compliant, unfair, unsafe or unsound. Moreover, lawsuits may be brought by appropriate regulatory agencies, attorneys general and private parties for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. Accordingly, a failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our business could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
New consumer protection and privacy protection laws or regulations are likely to impose additional requirements on the enforcement of and recovery on consumer credit card or installment accounts, telephonic sales, Internet communications and other portions of our business. We cannot ensure that some of the receivables were not established as a result of identity theft or unauthorized use of credit and, accordingly, we will not be able to recover the amount of these and other defaulted consumer receivables. As a purchaser of defaulted consumer receivables, we may acquire receivables subject to legitimate defenses on the part of the consumer. In general, our account purchase contracts allow us to return to the debt seller certain defaulted consumer receivables that may not be collectible, due to these and other circumstances. Upon return, the debt sellers are required to replace the receivables with similar receivables or repurchase the receivables. These provisions limit, to some extent, our potential losses on such accounts.
 
Employees
 
We currently have no employees other than our sole officer and director, Mr. Fu. Our officer serves us on a part time basis and is not compensated at this time. We also hired Ms. Zixiao Chen and Desert Skyline as our business consultants.
