Overview
 
Lineage is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel cell therapies to address unmet medical needs. Our programs are based on our proprietary cell-based technology platform and associated development and manufacturing capabilities. From this platform, we design, develop, manufacture, and test specialized human cells with anatomical and physiological functions similar to, or identical to, cells found naturally in the human body. Cells which we manufacture are created by specific developmental biological differentiation protocols that we apply to established, well-characterized, and self-renewing pluripotent cell lines. These cells are transplanted into patients and are designed to (a) replace or support cells that are absent or dysfunctional due to degenerative disease, aging, or traumatic injury, and (b) restore or augment functional activity in the affected person.
 
Our strategy is to efficiently leverage our technology platform and our development, formulation, delivery, and manufacturing capabilities to advance our programs internally, or in conjunction with strategic partners, to further enhance their value and probability of success. As one example, in December 2021 we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Roche Agreement”) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group (collectively or individually, “Roche” or “Genentech”), wherein we granted to Roche exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize retinal pigment epithelium (“RPE”) cell therapies, including our proprietary cell therapy program known as OpRegen®, for the treatment of ocular disorders, including geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Under the terms of the Roche Agreement, Lineage received a $50.0 million upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $620.0 million in certain developmental, regulatory, and commercialization milestone payments. Lineage also is eligible to receive tiered double-digit percentage royalties on net sales of OpRegen in the U.S. and other major markets. See Note 14 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for discussion on the Roche Agreement.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we have five allogeneic, or “off-the-shelf,” cell therapy programs in development, of which three have reached clinical testing:
 
Product Candidates 
 

● | OpRegen®, an allogeneic retinal pigment epithelium cell replacement therapy currently in a Phase 2a multicenter clinical trial, being conducted by Genentech, for the treatment of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), also known as atrophic or dry AMD. A previous Phase 1/2a trial conducted by Lineage enrolled twenty-four (24) individuals with dry AMD with GA. In December 2021, this program was partnered with Roche for further clinical development and commercialization.

● | OPC1, an allogeneic oligodendrocyte progenitor cell therapy currently in long-term follow-up from a Phase 1/2a multicenter clinical trial for cervical spinal cord injuries (“SCI”). To date, five (5) patients with thoracic spinal cord injuries and twenty-five (25) patients with cervical spinal cord injuries have been enrolled in clinical trials of OPC1. The clinical development of OPC1 has been partially funded by $14.3 million received under a grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (“CIRM”). Additional clinical trials are being planned. 
● | VAC, an allogeneic cancer immunotherapy comprised of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. One of the VAC product candidates, VAC2, is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). This clinical trial is being funded and conducted by Cancer Research UK, one of the world’s largest independent cancer research charities. An additional VAC-based product candidate is in preclinical development with our partner, Immunomic Therapeutics, Inc. (“ITI”), for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”). 
● | ANP1, an allogeneic auditory neuron progenitor cell transplant currently in preclinical development for the treatment of debilitating hearing loss (“DHL”). 
● | PNC1, an allogeneic photoreceptor cell transplant currently in preclinical development for the treatment of vision loss due to photoreceptor dysfunction or damage.

Other Programs
 
We have additional undisclosed product candidates being considered for development, which cover a range of therapeutic areas and unmet medical needs. Generally, these product candidates are based on the same platform technology and employ a similar guided cell differentiation and transplant approach as the product candidates detailed above, but in some cases may also include genetic modifications designed to enhance efficacy and/or safety profiles.
 
In addition to seeking to create value for shareholders by developing product candidates and advancing those candidates through clinical development, we also may seek to create value from our large patent estate and additional related technologies and capabilities, through partnering and/or strategic transactions.
 
2022 Development Highlights
 
We achieved numerous strategic and operational accomplishments during 2022, including advancing our clinical programs and product development in several key programs.
 

● | Continued execution under our collaboration with Roche and Genentech for the development of RG6501 (OpRegen) across multiple functional areas. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The expansion of our clinical pipeline to include a new auditory neuronal cell transplant program (ANP1) for the treatment of hearing loss. 
● | The expansion of our clinical pipeline to include a new cell therapy development program, photoreceptor neural cell (PNC1) transplants for the treatment of vision loss due to photoreceptor dysfunction. 
● | Data were presented at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology annual meeting (ARVO), suggesting that OpRegen continues to be well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile, coupled with visual function and outer retinal structure improvements in patients with GA and impaired vision.
● | Reported that our partner, Cancer Research UK, had completed patient enrollment in a Phase 1 clinical study of VAC2 for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. 

Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to address unmet medical needs by developing and advancing allogeneic, or “off-the-shelf,” treatments comprised of functional cells delivered to the body. Our biological therapies are derived from the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells from established and self-renewing cell lines. We direct these pluripotent cells to become specific cell types, or combinations of cell types, and use those differentiated cells as treatments to restore diseased or diminished functions, such as impaired vision, loss of movement, sensation, and hearing, or to increase immune response to tumors or infectious agents.
 
To support the furtherance of our product candidates, we aim to generate or have generated in vitro and in vivo data to support human testing where such testing is warranted. In some cases, we may collaborate with strategic partners, external advisors, or consultants to support the development of our cell therapy technology.
 
One area of focus is our continued effort to support our partner, Genentech, with the production and testing of our lead product candidate, OpRegen (RG6501), which currently is being evaluated in a 30-60 patient Phase 2a multicenter, open-label, single arm clinical study, as well as in the follow-up portion of a 24-patient Phase 1/2a multicenter, open-label, clinical study, in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD).
 
We also aim to advance our clinical-stage product candidate, OPC1, for the treatment of spinal cord injury, into a clinical study to evaluate the safety and performance of a novel cell delivery system to deliver oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to the spinal parenchyma.
 

8 | P a g e

Our clinical stage dendritic cell product candidate, VAC2, is the subject of a Phase 1 clinical trial conducted by our partner, Cancer Research UK, which has completed enrollment of eight (8) patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and we anticipate receiving additional data from that trial during this year.
 
Our preclinical product candidates, ANP1 for hearing loss and our photoreceptor program, PNC1, to address various forms of blindness, will continue to be evaluated in preclinical testing to determine the suitability of each program to advance into initial human testing.
 
We have identified, and we may seek to develop, additional product candidates based on our cell replacement approach. We may elect to conduct these activities on our own or through various collaborative arrangements. Such additional product candidates could include gene edits, which may provide enhanced functionality or offer more attractive safety or commercial profiles. We may utilize various types of pluripotent cell lines as starting material for our product candidates. Presently, our process development and manufacturing activities, including our cGMP production of clinical trial material, are predominantly conducted at our facility located in Jerusalem Israel, but such work may be supplemented or complemented by our additional facility located in Carlsbad, California.
 
Cell Therapy Technology Platform 
 
We believe we are a leader in pluripotent, cell-based asset development based on directed differentiation protocols of cellular lineages and cell manufacturing capabilities. Pluripotent cells, which are widely published as capable of becoming any human cell type, have potential applications in many areas of medicine with large unmet patient needs, including certain age-related degenerative diseases, degenerative conditions, or traumatic injury. We are currently in clinical development for various pluripotent cell-derived product candidates such as RPE cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and dendritic cells and preclinical development for auditory neurons and photoreceptor cells. In addition, we are considering the differentiation of pluripotent cells into additional cell types that may have therapeutic benefits in other areas of unmet medical need.
 
Cellular therapies are often aimed at regenerating or replacing affected cells or tissues and therefore may have more durable, broader, or more suitable applicability than certain traditional pharmaceutical products which seek to influence a single molecular target or group of biological pathways. Small molecules and biologic therapies that require systemic delivery into the body often have unexpected side effects that can limit their usefulness. When cell replacement is locally administered to a specific anatomical compartment, systemic side effects are usually well-tolerated. Lineage’s cell therapy approach resembles transplant medicine, as it is focused on whether transplanted cells are retained or rejected by the body and whether the transplanted cells function as expected.
 
A key advantage of our approach is that it can provide us the opportunity to rapidly develop new programs without the extensive and costly steps traditionally required to develop a small molecule agonist or antagonist. Whereas small molecule product development typically requires selection and validation of a drug target, followed by screening millions of molecules (e.g., a “library” of compounds) to identify hits, followed by chemical modification guided by structure-activity relationship or “SAR” to develop a hit into a more potent lead, the process of developing a new cell therapy from pluripotent lines can be comparatively faster because the target cell type is already known to be “validated”, insofar as it is well-established in the literature as being the cell type which is dysfunctional or deficient in the patient. The most challenging step in developing a new cell therapy is the establishment of a controllable and reproducible differentiation protocol which can create the quality of cells to support clinical testing and commercial supply, a process which avoids mass screening campaigns and is more readily accomplished via the combination of literature reviews and in-house experience with pluripotent cell differentiation. This approach can facilitate pipeline expansion at a lower cost than traditional methods (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Lineage’s Internal cGMP Facility Capabilities
 
In addition to our corporate headquarters located in Carlsbad, California, we recently opened a new research and development (R&D) facility also located in Carlsbad, expanding the Company’s R&D capabilities in the U.S. and supporting the development of current and future allogeneic cell transplant programs. We also have a modern and innovative manufacturing facility in the Bio Park on the campus of the Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel. The facility includes process development laboratories and a state-of-the-art, current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) cell manufacturing facility. It is designed and equipped to run simultaneous cGMP processes and to produce a range of cell therapy products for human use in clinical trials as well as improve scalability for potential commercialization. Currently, all of our cGMP manufacturing processes, including cell banking and product manufacturing for our cell therapy product candidates, are conducted in this facility (Figure 2).

OpRegen®
 
OpRegen is a retinal pigment epithelial cell therapy in Phase 2a development for the treatment of geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration. Following subretinal delivery, OpRegen has the potential to counteract RPE cell loss in areas of GA lesions by supporting retinal structure and function. OpRegen is being developed under a worldwide collaboration between Lineage, Roche and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. See Note 14 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for discussion on the Roche Agreement.
 
OpRegen has been granted Fast Track Designation from the U.S. FDA, which includes an expedited regulatory path with the ability for increased interfacing with the FDA during the clinical development process.
 
AMD is a gradual, progressive, deterioration of the macula, the small sensitive area in the center of the retina that provides clear, high-definition central vision. It is a leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 65 in the developed world. According to a 2022 report in JAMA Ophthalmology, 18.34 million individuals in the U.S. 40 years and older (11.64%) were living with early-stage AMD and 1.49 million (0.94%) were living with late-stage AMD in 2019. As the area of atrophy begins to include the fovea (the center of the macula), patients may lose their central vision, making facial recognition, reading, and driving difficult or impossible, and may ultimately become legally blind. The exact cause of GA secondary to AMD is unknown, but is thought to result from multiple factors, such as genetics, age, smoking history, and environmental effects. There are two clinical presentations of AMD, the dry form, and the wet, or neovascular form (growth of abnormal new blood vessels). Dry AMD typically advances slowly toward GA as RPE cells and photoreceptors become dysfunctional and deteriorate over time. RPE cells support and nourish the retina by metabolizing waste by-products and producing a number of components essential for photoreceptor health and function. If the metabolic waste products accumulate, lesions known as drusen may result. Approximately 85-90% of AMD patients suffer from the dry form of AMD, for which there is only one FDA approved therapeutic option at this time. Additionally, dry AMD may also lead to wet AMD, a condition for which there are several FDA-approved treatments administered locally to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels. Physicians often recommend a healthy diet, exercise and/or nutritional supplements for dry AMD, but nutritional supplements have shown limited efficacy in delaying the onset of more progressive disease in longer-term studies. The schematics in Figures 3 and 4 show a representation of the process of drusen formation and the goal of cell replacement therapy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe one of the most promising approaches to treat GA secondary to dry AMD is to replace the layer of damaged RPE cells with new, healthy, and functional RPE cells manufactured from a well-characterized, allogeneic cell line, transplanted to the subretinal space around the atrophic area (GA). OpRegen is a cell replacement therapy derived from our pluripotent cell technology in which our proprietary directed-differentiation methods convert pluripotent stem cells into nearly pure populations of RPE cells. Using this method, OpRegen is grown free of any animal products and consists of human RPE cells with high yield and purity that can be transplanted directly into the patient’s eye, where the patient’s own RPE cells are missing or dysfunctional. The OpRegen therapeutic approach is designed to replace damaged or lost RPE cells with the goal of slowing disease progression to preserve and/or restore visual function.
 
OpRegen is intended to be an allogeneic, or “off-the-shelf,” product provided to retinal surgeons in an “easy-to-use” form for transplantation. We believe OpRegen could have a lasting benefit from a single administration, or may be administered every several years. This approach differs from other investigational agents, as well as for the single approved drug for treatment of GA secondary to AMD, pegcetacoplan injection (SYFOVRE®), and approved agents currently marketed for wet AMD, such as ranibizumab (Lucentis®) and aflibercept (Eylea®). All of these approaches require repeated, frequent (monthly or every-other-month) intravitreal injections into the eye.
 
In a Phase 1/2a clinical trial, OpRegen has demonstrated the potential to slow, stop or reverse disease progression in geographic atrophy secondary to AMD. This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, dose-escalation trial evaluating a single administration of OpRegen delivered subretinally in patients with bilateral GA. Patient enrollment completed in November 2020, with twenty-four patients recruited into four cohorts. The first three cohorts enrolled only legally blind patients with a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/200 or worse. The fourth cohort enrolled 12 patients with impaired vision (BCVA from 20/65 to 20/250 with smaller mean areas of GA). Cohort 4 also included patients treated with a new “thaw-and-inject” formulation of OpRegen, which could be shipped directly to sites and used immediately upon thawing. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OpRegen as assessed by the incidence and frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events. Secondary objectives evaluated the preliminary activity of OpRegen treatment by assessing the changes in ophthalmological parameters measured by various methods of primary clinical relevance. Long-term follow-up of patients in this study is currently ongoing.
 
Results from the primary endpoint, the safety and tolerability at one year post-OpRegen transplant, were presented at the 2022 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Annual Meeting (ARVO 2022), and suggest that OpRegen RPE cells are generally well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Importantly, no unexpected ocular adverse events (AEs) were observed and those events that were observed were considered expected based on the surgical procedures involved in OpRegen administration, such as vitrectomy. Most AEs reported (cohorts 1-3, 87%; cohort 4, 93%) were mild in severity.
 
Findings on clinical examination by different imaging modalities have shown positive clinical benefits in some patients as evidenced by retinal structure improvement and decreases in drusen, as well as durable engraftment of OpRegen cells now extending to more than five years in the earliest treated patients. Across the study, a trend toward slower GA progression in treated compared to untreated eyes continues to be present. Of note, five subjects from cohort 4 where the OpRegen suspension was delivered to most or all of the GA area, including the fovea, have shown evidence of outer retinal structural improvement (tissue restoration). This was accompanied by a reduction in the overall size, or no growth in the area of atrophy, at least 12 months post-treatment and the presence of key retinal cells that were not observable at baseline study entry. This anatomical effect was accompanied by improvements in visual acuity in most cohort 4 treated patients (average gain of 7.6 letters read), but particularly the five patients with better surgical coverage (average 12.8 letter gain). Furthermore, differences in visual acuity between treated and untreated eyes remained statistically significant across Cohort 4 patients at 15 months post-treatment. These unprecedented findings support the view that dry AMD is not an irreversible, degenerative condition and that some portion of diseased retinal tissue may be recoverable in atrophic end-stage disease patients.

In December 2021, we entered into the Roche Agreement for the development and commercialization of OpRegen. See “—Collaborations—Roche Collaboration Agreement,” below.
 
In November 2022, we announced our partner Genentech, a member of the Roche group has launched a Phase 2a, multicenter, open-label, single arm clinical study of RG6501 (OpRegen), a retinal pigment epithelial cell therapy. The study is intended to optimize subretinal surgical delivery and evaluate the safety and activity of OpRegen in approximately 30, and up to 60, patients with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate (i) the proportion of patients with subretinal surgical delivery of OpRegen to target regions under the retina, and (ii) to evaluate the safety of subretinal surgical delivery of OpRegen as measured by the incidence and severity of procedure-related adverse events at 3 months following surgery. A key secondary objective is to evaluate the proportion of patients with qualitative improvement in retinal structure, as determined by Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) imaging, within 3 months following surgery. RG6501 (OpRegen) is currently being developed under an exclusive worldwide collaboration between Lineage, Roche and Genentech.
 
OPC1
 
OPC1 is an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell therapy in Phase 1/2a development for the treatment of acute SCI. SCI occurs when the spinal cord is subjected to a severe crush or contusion injury, such as that caused by a car or motorcycle accident, and typically results in severe functional impairment, including limb paralysis, aberrant pain signaling, and/or loss of bladder and sexual function. There are approximately 18,000 new spinal cord injuries annually in the U.S. (NSCIC SCI Facts and Figures at a Glance (2019)), and there are currently no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of SCI, although methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid generally used as an anti-inflammatory drug, is sometimes prescribed on an off-label basis to reduce acute inflammation in the injured spinal cord immediately after injury. Approaches to treat this complex injury may include multiple mechanisms of action, such as biologics that preserve surviving neurons and stimulate new nerve axon outgrowth, suppression of lesion cavity formation at the injury site, generation of new blood vessels to repair the ischemic damage from injury, and myelination of the demyelinated and newly formed nerve axons. A promising therapeutic target in SCI is replacement of oligodendrocytes that are selectively lost at the injury site. As the sole source of the insulating protein myelin in the brain and spinal cord, oligodendrocytes wrap around nerve axons and allow the conduction of electrical impulses throughout the central nervous system (“CNS”), as shown in Figure 5.
 
Figure 5. Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the CNS and are critical for nerve signal conduction
 

OPC1 is derived from our pluripotent cell technology under cGMP conditions using a directed differentiation method. These cells are stored frozen until ready for use and prepared for direct administration into the injured spinal cord. Based on preclinical studies, when OPC1 is transplanted into the injured spinal cord, the cells undergo further maturation to generate a replacement population of oligodendrocytes at the injury site that are capable of remyelinating denuded and newly formed nerve axons. Based on preclinical studies, prior to their maturation, the transplanted oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are believed to stimulate additional reparative processes, including promotion of neuron survival and nerve axon outgrowth, and induction of blood vessel formation in and around the injury site. In addition, OPC1 cells rapidly migrate from the injection point to the injury site where they generate a supportive tissue matrix and suppress cavitation. Cavitation is a destructive process that occurs within the spinal cord following SCI, and typically results in permanent loss of motor and sensory function. A patient with cavitation can develop a condition known as syringomyelia, which results in additional neurological and functional damage to the patient and can result in chronic pain (Figure 6). Based on the multiple reparative properties associated with OPC1, we believe this candidate cell therapy product is ideally suited to treat neurological conditions such as SCI and other demyelination disorders of the CNS.
 
Figure 6. Suppression of spinal cavitation in a rat contusion model

The development of OPC1 has been supported by a $14.3 million clinical development grant from CIRM. We intend to apply for additional grants from CIRM for the program’s continued development. See “—Grants from Government Entities,” below.
 
Before our acquisition of Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. (“Asterias”), Asterias was testing OPC1 in two clinical trials: a five-patient Phase 1 safety trial in acute thoracic SCI and a 25-patient Phase 1/2a dose escalation trial in subacute cervical SCI, called the SCiStar trial. The SCiStar trial was an open-label, single-arm trial that tested three sequential escalating doses of OPC1 administered at up to 20 million OPC1 cells with subacute, C-4 to C-7, motor complete (AIS-A or AIS-B) cervical SCI. OPC1 was administered 21 to 42 days post-injury. Patients were followed by neurological exams and imaging procedures to assess the safety and activity of the product. Key findings for both the thoracic and cervical studies are shown in Figure 7.
 
Figure 7. OPC1 Thoracic & Cervical Clinical Trials Overview 
 

The FDA designated OPC1 as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”), for the treatment of subacute SCI. RMAT is an accelerated development pathway and includes the ability for increased interfacing with the FDA during clinical development. The FDA has also granted OPC1 Orphan Drug Designation, providing a pathway to possible market exclusivity.
 
In 2019, we transferred all cGMP manufacturing processes, including the establishment of cell banks and the OPC1 process development and manufacturing for clinical studies, to our cell therapy manufacturing facility in Jerusalem, Israel. Improvements to the manufacturing process were performed to create enhancements to the production process and scale and to achieve greater purity of OPC1. We also developed a thaw and inject formulation of OPC1 to facilitate logistics and handling at the point of care with the elimination of the dose preparation at the clinical site. Throughout 2021, we manufactured clinical batches based on the improved process in a thaw and inject formulation in preparation for a larger-scale, late-stage clinical trial.
 
In February 2021, we announced an exclusive agreement with Neurgain Technologies, Inc. (“Neurgain”), to evaluate a novel delivery system for OPC1. Preliminary assessment of prototypes revealed promising compatibility with OPC1 product while simplifying the surgical procedure by providing surgeons with an instrument that is small, simple to use, and would not require stopping the patient’s ventilator to perform the injection, allowing for flexibility with accurate delivery to the injury site. We continued to evaluate the Neurgain device throughout 2021 and 2022. We have submitted an RMAT package to the FDA to support the use of a new delivery device, along with a protocol synopsis for a small safety study in both subacute and chronic patients. We intend to submit an IND amendment during 2023 for a human safety clinical study to validate the device (DOSED – Delivery of Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells for Spinal Cord Injury: Evaluation of a Novel Device) and an additional submission to support the use of the device in a late-stage clinical study to follow.
 
We are actively working both on expanding our existing and establishing new collaborative partnerships with SCI patient engagement and advocacy organizations, with the overarching goals of enhancing awareness of SCI and elevating the patient’s voice in the treatment development process.
 
VAC Platform
 
VAC is our immuno-oncology platform using dendritic cells loaded with antigens for the treatment of cancer. Cancer afflicts millions worldwide and represents one of the largest unmet clinical needs with current treatment options providing limited efficacy and a wide range of potentially debilitating side effects. As the most potent type of antigen-presenting cell in the body, dendritic cells instruct the human body’s immune system to attack and eliminate harmful pathogens and unwanted cells, including cancer cells.
 

14 | P a g e
------------

 

To provide a more targeted treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we are currently developing VAC2 as an allogeneic, or non-patient specific, cancer vaccine designed to stimulate patient immune responses to an antigen, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), which is commonly expressed in cancerous cells but is not usually found in normal adult cells. VAC2 is produced by our pluripotent cell technology using a directed differentiation method and is comprised of a population of mature dendritic cells to which the hTERT antigen was introduced via an mRNA construct which is loaded into the dendritic cell via electroporation. The VAC1 autologous program, which preceded VAC2 but relied on the same antigen, served as proof of concept behind our approach to utilize dendritic cell vaccines targeting telomerase to treat cancer.
 
Using pluripotent cells as the starting material for VAC production offers certain advantages. Compared to technologies that rely on the use of a patient’s own blood, our pluripotent cell technology provides a path to a more scalable system for the production of a large number of vaccine doses, lower manufacturing costs, greater product consistency, and off-the-shelf availability. In addition, we believe that as an allogeneic therapy, VAC has the potential to stimulate a more robust immune response through an adjuvant effect resulting from the partial immune mismatch between the VAC cells and patients receiving the therapy. We believe that VAC can be used as a platform technology that can be modified to carry a diverse number or type of antigen, including patient-specific tumor neo-antigens.
 
In September 2014, Asterias initiated clinical development of VAC2 by entering into a Clinical Trial and Option Agreement (the “CRUK Agreement”) with Cancer Research UK (“CRUK”) and Cancer Research Technology Limited (“CRT”), a wholly owned subsidiary of CRUK, under which CRUK agreed to fund Phase 1 clinical development of VAC2 in NSCLC. CRUK was responsible, at its own cost, for manufacturing clinical grade VAC2 and for carrying out the Phase 1 clinical trial of VAC2. In April 2022, we announced that CRUK had completed patient enrollment in the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of VAC2 for the treatment of NSCLC. All eight patients completed dosing in the initial aspect of the trial and CRUK is currently conducting analyses of various samples collected per protocol.
 
As previously reported, VAC2 demonstrated potent and specific induction of immune response in all patients dosed and analyzed to date, with high levels of peripheral antigen-specific immunogenicity observed at multiple time points. Importantly, VAC2 appeared to be well tolerated with no unexpected adverse events (AEs) and no dose-limiting toxicity, serious adverse events (SAEs) or AEs.
 
We completed the transfer of all cGMP manufacturing processes, including the establishment of cell banks and the VAC2 process development and manufacturing for clinical studies, to our cell therapy manufacturing facility in Jerusalem, Israel.
 
In April 2021, Lineage entered into a worldwide license and development collaboration agreement with ITI. See “—Collaborations—ITI Collaboration Agreement,” below.
 
Throughout 2022, we focused on improving the manufacturing process for VAC to provide a reliable supply for potential future clinical studies and commercial development. We submitted a pre-IND package to the FDA in the third quarter of 2022 and have received important feedback that will help guide any future full IND submission(s). We also continue to evaluate additional opportunities for the introduction of new VAC candidates based on internally identified or partnered tumor antigens to expand the VAC platform.
 
Auditory Neurons
 
The Auditory Neurons program was established in 2022 with the goal of advancing auditory neuron transplant therapy as a treatment option for hearing loss conditions. The initial focus of this program is on the treatment of auditory neuropathy spectrum disorders (ANSD), a group of conditions characterized by the loss of auditory neuron function where the sound is not transmitted properly from the cochlea (inner ear) to the brain. Based on our proprietary technology platform, we have developed a unique differentiation process for generating auditory neurons (ANP1), which are planned to undergo preclinical testing this year to assess their safety and delivery system. In February 2023, we reported that preclinical testing of ANP1 had begun through a collaboration with the University of Michigan and Yehoash Raphael, Ph.D., The R. Jamison and Betty Williams Professor of Otolaryngology, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and Lab Director at the University of Michigan Kresge Hearing Research Institute.

Photoreceptors 
 
The Photoreceptor program is developing the process of directing the differentiation of human pluripotent cells into clinical-grade transplantable photoreceptor precursors/cells (PRCs) and to show their further differentiation, integration, and function after transplantation into the subretinal space of animal models of photoreceptor degeneration. Photoreceptor degeneration is the hallmark of a variety of retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Currently, the only approved treatments are gene therapies which treat specific genetic defects that lead to RP. Our PNC1 program is aimed to replace damaged photoreceptors regardless of the origin of degeneration. We hope to be able to present top-line preclinical data once the appropriate intellectual property submissions have been made and as data become available.
Collaborations
 
To accelerate the discovery and advancement of transplanting specific cell types into the body, we have entered into, and intend to seek additional opportunities to form collaborations with a diverse group of strategic partners. We have entered collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, government agencies, academic laboratories, and research institutes with resources and expertise in diverse areas in an effort to advance our discovery and development platforms and will continue to evaluate such collaborations.
 
One key principle of our approach to collaborations is to share rewards and risks of conducting large-scale clinical trials and commercializing a product, but also to provide the broadest patient population with the earliest access to our therapies.
 
Roche Collaboration Agreement 
 
On December 17, 2021, Lineage entered into the Roche Agreement, pursuant to which Lineage granted to Roche exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize retinal pigment epithelium cell therapies, including its proprietary cell therapy known as OpRegen, for the treatment of ocular disorders, including advanced dry AMD with GA.
 
Under the terms of the Roche Agreement, Roche will assume responsibility for further clinical development and commercialization of OpRegen, Lineage will be responsible for completing activities related to the ongoing clinical study Phase 1/2a open-label, dose-escalation clinical safety and efficacy study in patients with advanced dry AMD with GA, for which enrollment is complete, and performing certain manufacturing and process development activities.
 
Roche paid Lineage a $50.0 million upfront payment (which was received in January 2022) and Lineage is eligible to receive up to an additional $620.0 million in certain developmental, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments. Lineage is also eligible for tiered double-digit percentage royalties on net sales of OpRegen. All milestone payments, and royalty payments, due under the Roche Agreement are subject to the existence of certain intellectual property rights that cover OpRegen at the time such payments would otherwise become due, and the royalties on net sales of OpRegen are subject to financial offsets based on the existence of competing products.
 
Unless earlier terminated by either party, the Roche Agreement will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of all of Roche’s payment obligations under the Roche Agreement. Roche may terminate the Roche Agreement in its entirety, or on a product-by-product or country-by-country basis, at any time with advanced written notice. Either party may terminate the Roche Agreement in its entirety with written notice for the other party’s material breach if such party fails to cure the breach. Either party also may terminate the Roche Agreement in its entirety upon certain insolvency events involving the other party.

Lineage is obligated to pay to the IIA (as defined below) approximately 24.3% of the upfront payment and of any future payments Lineage receives under the Roche Agreement, up to an aggregate cap on all payments to IIA, such cap growing over time via interest accrual until paid in full, which currently stands at approximately $91.2 million. In addition, pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated License Agreement, dated June 15, 2017, between our foreign subsidiary located in Jerusalem, Israel, Cell Cure Neurosciences Ltd. (“Cell Cure”), and Hadasit Medical Research and Development Ltd. (“Hadasit”), as amended, and a letter agreement entered into between Cell Cure and Hadasit on December 17, 2021, Cell Cure is obligated to pay to Hadasit (i) a maximum of 21.5% of the upfront payment (subject to certain reductions) and of any milestone payments Lineage receives from Roche under the Roche Agreement, and (ii) up to 50% of all royalty payments (subject to a maximum payment of 5% of net sales of products) Lineage receives from Roche under the Roche Agreement. In accordance with the foregoing obligations, from the $50.0 million upfront payment Lineage received from Roche in January 2022, Lineage paid $12.1 million to the IIA and $8.9 million to Hadasit. See “—Grants from Government Entities,” below, and Note 14 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information related to our obligations to the IIA and Hadasit.
 ITI Collaboration Agreement 
 
On April 16, 2021, Lineage entered a worldwide license and development collaboration with ITI (the “ITI Agreement”). Lineage is the sole and exclusive owner of the rights to the VAC platform and has licensed to ITI patents and materials for the development and commercialization of a novel cancer immunotherapy agent derived from this platform utilizing an antigen provided by ITI.
 
Under terms of the ITI Agreement, Lineage is entitled to initial fees totaling up to $2.0 million, which we have received $1.0 million , and up to an additional $67.0 million in development and commercial milestones across multiple indications. Lineage will also be eligible to receive royalties of up to 10% on net sales of future products. ITI has received a research and development grade of the VAC-CMV product and is evaluating its next steps. 
 
Grants from Government Entities 
 
Grants from the Israeli Innovation Authority
 
Under the Israeli Encouragement of Research, Development and Industrial Initiative Technology Law, 5744-1984, as amended, and related regulations (collectively, the “Innovation Law”), research and development programs which meet specified criteria and are approved by the Israel Innovation Authority (the “IIA”) are eligible for grants of up to 50% of the project’s expenditure, as determined by the research committee, in exchange for the payment of royalties from the revenues generated from the sale of product candidates and related services developed, in whole or in part pursuant to, or as a result of, a research and development program funded by the IIA. The royalties are generally at a range of 3.0% to 5.0% of revenues until the entire IIA grant is repaid, together with an annual interest generally tied to an interest rate index.
 
Under the Innovation Law, the manufacture of product candidates developed with government grants is required to be performed in Israel. The transfer of manufacturing activity outside Israel may be subject to the prior approval of the IIA, and if approved, may increase the royalties payable to the IIA, in certain cases substantially. The amount of the increase in the royalties payable depends on the percentage of manufacturing activity that occurs outside Israel.
 
The know-how developed within the framework of the Innovation Law plan may not be transferred to third parties outside Israel without the prior approval of a governmental committee chartered under the Innovation Law. The IIA approval to transfer know-how created, in whole or in part, in connection with an IIA-funded project to a third party outside Israel where the transferring company remains an operating Israeli entity is subject to payment of a redemption fee to the IIA calculated according to a formula provided under the Innovation Law that is based, in general, on the ratio between the aggregate IIA grants to the company’s aggregate investments in the project that was funded by these IIA grants, multiplied by the transaction consideration. The transfer of such know-how to a party outside Israel where the transferring company ceases to exist as an Israeli entity is subject to a redemption fee formula that is based, in general, on the ratio between the aggregate IIA grants to the total financial investments in the company, multiplied by the transaction consideration. The redemption fee in case of transfer of know-how to a party outside Israel is generally based on the ratio between the aggregate IIA grants received by the company and the company’s aggregate research and development expenses. The fee is multiplied by the transaction consideration, and the maximum amount payable to the IIA in case of transfer of know-how outside Israel will not exceed six times the value of the grants received plus interest. In the event that the receiver of the grants ceases to be an Israeli corporation such payment shall not exceed six times the value of the grants received plus interest, with a possibility to reduce such payment to up to three times the value of the grants received plus interest if the research and development activity remains in Israel for a period of three years after payment to the IIA.

The restrictions under the Innovation Law, including restrictions on the sale, transfer or licensing to a non-Israeli entity of know-how developed as part of the programs under which the grants were given, continue to apply even after the repayment of royalties in full by the grant recipient.
 
Part of Cell Cure’s research and development efforts have been financed, partially, through grants that it has received from the IIA and when we acquired our holdings in Cell Cure, we undertook in writing, vis-à-vis the IIA, to comply with, and to ensure the compliance by Cell Cure with, the Innovation Law. We therefore must comply with the requirements of the Innovation Law and related regulations. To date, through a series of separate grants beginning in 2007, Cell Cure received a total of $15.4 million from the IIA to support the OpRegen program. See Note 14 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.
 
Grants from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine
 
The clinical development of OPC1 has been supported by $14.3 million of grants from CIRM, a state agency established to fund stem cell research and development of new stem cell-based treatments. The terms of our grant award from CIRM require royalty payments to the California State General Fund based on net commercial revenue from the sale of any product, drug or service arising from CIRM-funded research as follows: 0.1% per $1.0 million of funds granted for the earlier of 10 years or nine times the award amount that has been paid. In addition, a 1% royalty will be owed on net commercial revenue in excess of $500 million per year until the last to expire patent covering a CIRM-funded invention, if any, contributed towards the commercialization of the product.
Other Programs
 
We may elect to develop additional product candidates currently in the earliest stages of development and which cover a range of therapeutic areas. Generally, these product candidates are still conceptual but are based on the same pluripotent platform technology and would employ a similar guided cell differentiation and transplant approach as our current clinical-stage products.

Patents and Trade Secrets
 
We seek to protect and rely on our proprietary cell-based therapy platform and associated development and manufacturing capabilities and derived product candidates through a variety of methods, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our platform technologies and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on contractual obligations with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. For example, in addition to protecting our proprietary rights with patents, we rely on unpatented trade secrets, improvements, know-how and innovation, and we take steps necessary to protect these rights, including through confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the United States and internationally. We may also file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements on our clinical products, clinical product candidates, and related technologies. There are no assurances that any of our intellectual property rights will guarantee complete or adequate protection or market exclusivity for our products and product candidates. We also enter into collaborative and other similar arrangements with third parties, such as license agreements, to in-license and/or out-license intellectual property rights. Our financial success will be dependent, in part, on our ability to obtain rights to commercially valuable patents, to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to operate without infringing any intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, we assess our patents and pending applications covering our products and product candidates. If we determine that any patents or patent applications no longer provide adequate or necessary protection, we may transfer or abandon such patents and patent applications to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.
 
We own or license, directly or through our subsidiaries, patent families that include several hundreds of U.S. and international patents and patent applications. We cannot be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending applications will result in issued patents.
 
OpRegen®
 
We have rights to issued U.S. and international patents and pending patent applications covering OpRegen. The issued patents have expiration dates ranging from 2028 to 2036. The pending applications, if issued, will have estimated expiration dates ranging from 2028 to 2042. These U.S. and international issued patents and pending applications also include those in-licensed from Hadasit, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hadassah Medical Organization. We also solely own pending U.S. and international patent applications relating to a cryopreserved thaw-and-inject formulation. The U.S. patent applications, and any filed international patent applications based on the PCT applications, if issued, will have estimated expiration dates in 2038. Pursuant to the Roche Agreement, we have licensed these patent rights to Roche to further develop and commercialize RPE cell therapies, including OpRegen (see “—Collaborations—Roche Collaboration Agreement” above).
 
OPC1
 
We have numerous U.S. and international issued patents and pending patent applications that are relevant to neural cells, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, including patent families acquired from Geron Corporation (“Geron”) that are directed to the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, including human embryonic stem (“hES”) cells, into various neural cell types, as well as various culture and purification methods. Additionally, there are four patent families with pending patent applications owned by us directed to improved methods of producing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell compositions, and methods of treatment of spinal cord injury using oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. The estimated expiration dates of the four patent families with pending applications owned by us range from 2036 to 2043. The commercial success of OPC1 depends, in part, upon our ability to exclude competition for this product with the existing patent portfolio, regulatory exclusivity, undisclosed know-how and/or trade secrets, or a combination of these barriers to entry.

VAC Platform 
 
We have numerous U.S. and international issued patents and pending patent applications that are relevant to dendritic cells, including patent families acquired from Geron or in-licensed from third parties that are directed to the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, including hES cells, into hematopoietic progenitor cells and immature and mature dendritic cells. In addition, these patent rights include a patent family with claims directed to immunogenic compositions comprising antigen-presenting dendritic cells and methods of eliciting an anti-telomerase immune response in a subject by administering to the subject such compositions. The expiration dates of the patents, and the estimated expiration dates of the pending applications, acquired from Geron or in-licensed to us range from 2022 to 2029. We also solely own pending U.S. and international patent applications relating to VAC and VAC processes with estimated expiration dates, if issued, from 2041 to 2043. The commercial success of VAC products depends, in part, upon our ability to exclude competition in these products with this patent portfolio, regulatory exclusivity, undisclosed know-how and/or trade secrets, or a combination of these barriers to entry.
 
Auditory Neurons 
 
We have a pending U.S. provisional patent application for our ANP1 program. It is anticipated that this provisional patent application will be converted to a U.S. utility patent application and one or more international patent applications in 2023 and, if issued, would have estimated patent expiration dates of 2043.
Photoreceptors 
 
We have pending U.S. and international patent applications for our PNC1 program. These pending patent applications include a patent family licensed from Hadasit and a patent family solely owned by Lineage. The pending patent applications licensed from Hadasit, if issued, would have estimated patent expiration dates of 2038. The pending patent applications owned by Lineage, if issued, would have estimated patent expiration dates of 2036. We also have a pending U.S. provisional patent application jointly owned with Hadasit. It is anticipated that this provisional patent application will be converted to a U.S. utility patent application and one or more international applications in 2023 and, if issued, would have estimated patent expiration dates of 2043.
General Risks Related to Obtaining and Enforcing Patent Protection
 
Because patent applications are confidential until a patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not know if our competitors have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our products. In addition, if competitors file patent applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in interference/derivation proceedings or litigation to determine the right to a patent. Litigation and interference/derivation proceedings are unpredictable and expensive, such that, even if we are ultimately successful, our results of operations may be adversely affected by such events. Accordingly, there is a risk that any patent applications that we file and any patents that we hold or later obtain could be challenged by third parties and be declared invalid in view of third-party patent applications and/or patents. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes’ reviews or other proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We may also face challenges to our patent and regulatory protections covering our products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics and biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or regulatory exclusivity. Litigation, interference, oppositions, inter partes’ reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. The outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed any amounts that we may accrue on our financial statements as a reserve for contingent liabilities. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products and services.
 
The enforcement of patent rights often requires litigation against third-party infringers, and such litigation can be costly to pursue. Even if we succeed in having new patents issued or in defending any challenge to issued patents, there is no assurance that our patents will be comprehensive enough to provide us with meaningful patent protection against our competitors.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 78 employees, of which 25 were employed by Lineage and 53 were employed by Cell Cure and work in Israel. Of the 78 employees, 70 were employed on a full-time basis and eight were employed on a part-time basis. Eleven employees hold Ph.D. degrees in one or more fields of science or doctorates in medicine. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Manufacturing
 
Manufacturing of pluripotent-derived products is complex and requires the use of innovative technologies to handle living cells. Manufacturing these products requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose and specific quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary. Currently, all of our cGMP manufacturing processes, including cell banking and product manufacturing for our cell therapy product candidates, are conducted at our facility in Jerusalem, Israel. The facility, which includes process development laboratories and a cGMP manufacturing facility, is designed and equipped to enable simultaneous cGMP processes and to produce a range of cell therapy products for human use in clinical trials as well as at a scale suitable for commercial launch.
 
Our process development and manufacturing are designed to address the complexity of manufacturing cell-based therapies with a specific focus on the reproducibility and scale of the manufacturing process. To this end each of our manufacturing processes contains predefined steps that are controlled by a specific set of control tests that allow us to follow up the progression of production according to the manufacturing plan, We implement a variety of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional culture conditions to address the specific requirements of our pre-defined differentiation processes of the pluripotent cell into a functional cell product.
 
We obtain key components required for the manufacture of our cell therapy product candidates from third-party manufacturers and suppliers, which include, in some instances, sole source manufacturers and suppliers. We do not currently have long-term commitments or supply agreements in place to obtain certain key components used in the manufacture of our cell therapy product candidates.
 
Licensed Technology and Product Development Agreements
 
Lineage has obtained the right to use various technologies that we believe have great potential in our product development efforts, and that may be useful to other companies that are engaged in the research and development of products for human therapeutic and diagnostic use.
Second Amendment to Clinical Trial and Option Agreement and License Agreement with Cancer Research UK 
 
In March 2020, Lineage and its wholly owned subsidiary Asterias entered into a Second Amendment to Clinical Trial and Option Agreement (the “CTOA Amendment”) with CRUK and CRT, which amends the Clinical Trial and Option Agreement entered into between Asterias, CRUK and CRT dated September 8, 2014, as amended September 8, 2014. Pursuant to the CTOA Amendment, Lineage assumed all obligations of Asterias and exercised early its option to acquire data generated in the Phase 1 clinical trial of VAC2 in non-small cell lung cancer being conducted by CRUK.
 
Either party may terminate the CRT License Agreement for the uncured material breach of the other party. CRT may terminate the CRT License Agreement in the case of Lineage’s insolvency or if Lineage ceases all development and commercialization of all products under the CRT License Agreement.

WARF Agreements
 
We have rights to certain U.S and international issued patents, pending patent applications, and stem cell lines with the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (“WARF”) under a Commercial License and Option Agreement entered into between Lineage and WARF in January 2008 and a Non-Exclusive License Agreement entered into between Asterias and WARF in October 2013 (collectively, the “WARF Agreements”).
 
Under the WARF Agreements, we have a worldwide non-exclusive license under certain WARF patents and WARF-owned primate (including human) stem cell lines covered by such patents for use in internal research, and to make, use and sell products that are used as research tools and products that are discovered or developed through our internal research using such patents and stem cells. We paid upfront license fees and have agreed to additional payments upon the attainment of specified clinical development milestones, royalties on sales of commercialized products, and, subject to certain exclusions, a percentage of any payments that we may receive from any sublicenses that we may grant to use the licensed patents or stem cell lines.
 
The WARF Agreements will terminate with respect to licensed patents upon the expiration of the last licensed patent to expire and with respect to licensed cell lines until terminated by a party. We may terminate the WARF Agreements at any time with prior written notice, and WARF may terminate the WARF Agreements upon a breach. We have agreed to indemnify WARF and certain other designated affiliated entities from liability arising out of or relating to the death or injury of any person or damage to property due to the sale, marketing, use or manufacture of products that are covered by the licensed patents, licensed stem cell lines or inventions or materials developed or derived from the licensed patents or stem cell lines.
 
Royalty Agreement with Geron
 
In connection with Asterias’s acquisition of Geron’s stem cell assets in October 2013, we entered into a royalty agreement with Geron (the “Royalty Agreement”) pursuant to which we agreed to pay Geron a 4% royalty on net sales by us or any of our affiliates or sales agents of any products that we develop and commercialize that are covered by the patents Geron contributed to us. In the case of sales of such products by a person other than us or one of our affiliates or sales agents, we will be required to pay Geron 50% of all royalties and cash payments received by us or by our affiliate in respect of a product sale. The Royalty Agreement will terminate at the expiration or termination date of the last issued patent contributed by Geron under the Royalty Agreement. We estimate that the latest patent expiration date will be in 2029.
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, quality, approval, safety, efficacy, distribution, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, marketing, import/export and promotion of drugs, biologics, and medical devices. Authorities also heavily regulate many of these activities for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”).
 
FDA and Foreign Regulation of Therapeutic Products
 
The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs, biologics or medical devices, depending upon such factors as the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition, and the interaction of the product with the human body. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs, biologics and medical devices, among other things, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and implementing regulations. In addition, establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”) are subject to additional regulations, including registration and listing requirements and current good tissue practices. Certain proposed cell therapy products will be reviewed by the FDA staff in its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Office of Therapeutic Products (“OTP”).
 
Our domestic human drug and biologic products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate, an IND submission must be made to the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. Each clinical trial is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution.
 

22 | P a g e
------------

 

Phase 1 clinical trials are conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers or volunteers with the target disease or condition to assess safety and dosage. Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with the target disease or condition in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary safety and preliminary efficacy, in which case it is referred to as a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Phase 3 clinical trials are large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials and are conducted with patients afflicted with the target disease or condition in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the clinical trial based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the intended patient population. The clinical trial sponsor is required to report adverse events to the FDA and IRB in accordance with FDA laws and regulations. Monitoring of all aspects of the trial to minimize risks is a continuing process.
 
No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the U.S. until an appropriate New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) has been approved by the FDA. Submission of the application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. If an application is accepted for filing, following the FDA’s review, the FDA may grant marketing approval, or deny the application by way of a complete response letter if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to FDA approval. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured or perform an establishment file review of the site. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with the requirements of current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications including good tissue practices (“GTPs”) to the extent applicable. GMPs are FDA regulations that detail minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing of a drug product. GTPs are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require HCT/P establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. To maintain compliance with cGMPs, GTPs, and GCPs, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 
To date, the FDA has not granted marketing approval to any pluripotent stem cell-based therapeutic products, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may subject our product candidates to additional or more stringent review than drugs or biologics derived from other technologies.
 
The FDA offers several programs to expedite development of products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. A drug is eligible for designation as an RMAT if: the drug is a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product or any combination product using such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act; the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition.
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation is a separate process from seeking an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
 

23 | P a g e
------------

 

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same drug biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 
Combination Products
 
Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products comprised of two or more regulated components or parts such as a biologic and a device. When regulated independently, biologics and devices each have their own regulatory requirements. However, the regulatory requirements for a combination product comprised of a biologic administered with a delivery device can be more complex, because in addition to the individual regulatory requirements for each component, additional combination product regulatory requirements may apply. The Office of Combination Products at the FDA coordinates the review of such products and determines the primary mode of action of a combination product. The definition and regulatory requirements for combination products may differ significantly among countries in which we may seek approval of our product candidates.
 
FDA Regulation of Manufacturing
 
The FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, human tissue and cell products, and medical devices, requiring that they be produced in compliance with cGMP and cGTP. See “Manufacturing.” The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA, a material change is made to manufacturing equipment or to the location or manufacturing process, additional regulatory review may be required. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect the equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes of manufacturers following an initial approval. If, as a result of those inspections, the FDA determines that equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against the manufacturer, including suspension of manufacturing operations. Issues pertaining to manufacturing equipment, facilities or processes may also delay the approval of new products undergoing FDA review.
 
FDA Regulation of Advertising and Product Promotion
 
The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used to market pharmaceutical and biologic products. Claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA, a BLA, or an amendment to an NDA or a BLA, and must be consistent with the FDA-approved labeling and dosage information for that product.
 
Pharmaceutical and biologic products may be promoted only for the approved indications in accordance with the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label may be subject to significant liability. However, physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments but the FDA does restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 

24 | P a g e
------------

Foreign Regulation
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Federal Funding and State Regulations
 
Effective July 7, 2009, the NIH adopted guidelines on the use of hES cells in federally funded research. The central focus of the guidelines is to assure that hES cells used in federally funded research are derived from human embryos that were created for reproductive purposes, are no longer needed for this purpose, and are voluntarily donated for research purposes with the informed written consent of the donors. hES cells that were not derived in compliance with the guidelines, are not eligible for use in federally funded research.
 
The State of California has adopted legislation and regulations that require institutions that conduct stem cell research to notify, and in certain cases obtain approval from, a Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee (“SCRO Committee”) before conducting the research. Under certain California regulations, all hES cell lines used in our research must be acceptably derived. California regulations further require certain records to be maintained with respect to stem cell research and the materials used. Lineage programs that involve the use of stem cells have been reviewed by a SCRO Committee to confirm compliance with federal and state guidelines.
 
The hES cell lines that we use are all on the NIH registry of lines that have been reviewed and meet standards for federal funding grants. All of our research programs utilize stem cells from established and well-characterized cell lines and which are capable of self-renewal and expansion through normal cellular division (mitosis).

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations impose obligations on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, and their subcontractors that use, disclose, access, or otherwise process individually identifiable protected health information, with respect to protecting the privacy, security, and transmission of protected health information. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for covered health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties. Additionally, HITECH created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Privacy and Data Security Laws
 
In the ordinary course of our business, we may collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share (collectively, processing) personal data and other sensitive information, including data we collect about trial participants in connection with clinical trials. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security requirements related to data privacy, security, and protection under federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards. Compliance with such requirements increases the cost and complexity of doing business and non-compliance may result in, among other penalties and sanctions, substantial monetary fines. The data privacy, security, and protection laws to which we may be subject include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), Israel’s Protection of Privacy Law 5741-1981, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (“UK”) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), and the ePrivacy Directive. In addition, several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws, including Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah.

The CCPA and EU GDPR are examples of increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal data processing, which increase compliance obligations and exposure for noncompliance. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal data and a requirement to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data. Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for certain data breaches. Under the CPRA, effective January 1, 2023, California residents also have the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, establish restrictions on personal data retention, expand the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action. A new California Privacy Protection Agency was also established to implement and enforce the new law. U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data. The EU GDPR applies to any company established in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances. Moreover, under the EU GDPR, government regulators may impose temporary or definitive bans on data processing, as well as fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of a company’s annual global revenue, whichever is greater. Further, individuals may initiate litigation related to processing of their personal data. In addition, Israel’s Protection of Privacy Law 5741-1981 and the regulations promulgated thereunder impose certain obligations with respect to the manner personal data is processed, and government regulators may issue fines or sanctions for non-compliance.
 
Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws, which could make it more difficult to transfer information across jurisdictions (such as transferring or receiving personal data that originates in the EU or in other foreign jurisdictions). Existing mechanisms that facilitate cross-border personal data transfers may change or be invalidated. For example, absent appropriate safeguards or other circumstances, the EU GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA, such as the United States, that the European Commission does not consider to provide an adequate level of data privacy and security. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” (“SCCs”), that are designed to be a valid mechanism to facilitate personal data transfers out of the EEA to these jurisdictions. Currently, these SCCs are a valid mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the EEA, but there exists some uncertainty regarding whether the SCCs will remain a valid mechanism. Additionally, the SCCs impose additional compliance burdens, such as conducting transfer impact assessments to determine whether additional security measures are necessary to protect the at-issue personal data. In addition, Switzerland and the UK similarly restrict personal data transfers outside of those jurisdictions to countries, such as the United States, that do not provide an adequate level of personal data protection, and certain countries outside Europe (e.g., Israel) have also passed or are considering laws requiring local data residency or otherwise impeding the transfer of personal data across borders.
 
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
A variety of federal and state laws prohibit fraud and abuse. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. These contractors include Recovery Audit Contractors, Medicaid Integrity Contractors and Zone Program Integrity Contractors. In addition, CMS conducts Comprehensive Error Rate Testing audits, the purpose of which is to detect improper Medicare payments. Any overpayments identified must be repaid unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger universe of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the federal Anti- Kickback Statute is broad and may prohibit certain common activities within the healthcare industry, the Office of Inspector General for HHS has issued a series of statutory exceptions and regulatory “safe harbors.” However, these exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although payment and business practices that meet the requirements of a safe harbor are not treated as offenses under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of their facts and circumstances. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”) codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.
 
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens on behalf of the government, through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims.
 
HIPAA also created new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 
Many states have laws similar to the federal laws described above and the state laws may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing, and state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.

Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above, or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including sanctions, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with medical products. Accordingly, market acceptance of medical products can depend on the extent to which third-party coverage and reimbursement is available from government health administration authorities, private healthcare insurers and other healthcare funding organizations. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Pharmaceutical companies may be required to provide specified rebates or discounts on the products it sells to certain government funded programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and those rebates or discounts have increased over time. The ACA increased many of these mandatory discounts and rebates required and imposed a new branded prescription pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers fee payable each year by certain pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers.
 
Outside of the United States, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded healthcare programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.

In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional, and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”), among other things, removes penalties for not complying with ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Moreover, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and other litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA.‌
 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031, except for a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Further, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Congress is considering additional health reform measures.
 
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempted to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The implementation of the rule was delayed until 2032 by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries. The Most Favored Nation regulations mandate participation by identified Medicare Part B providers and will apply in all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021, and ending December 31, 2027. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021 CMS published a final rule that rescinds the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. Further, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order that included multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to President Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform. The plan sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles.

In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law by President Biden. The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D, which is a program available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 permits the Secretary of the HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years.
 
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

Marketing
 
We do not have established marketing, sales or distribution infrastructure or capabilities. In order to commercialize any of our product candidates if approved for commercial sale, we must either establish a sales and marketing organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities or collaborate with third-parties that have sales and marketing experience. As we move our product candidates through development toward regulatory approval, we intend to evaluate options for each product candidate’s commercialization strategy. These options include building our own sales force and other commercial infrastructure, entering into strategic marketing partnerships with third parties, out-licensing the product to other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, and combinations of these strategies.

Competition
 
The cell therapy industry is characterized by rapid innovation, intense and dynamic competition with a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, manufacturing capabilities, scientific knowledge, and experience in the field of cell therapy provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, as well as standard-of-care treatments, new products undergoing development and combinations of existing and new therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies, including combinations thereof, that may become available in the future.
 
As mentioned above, some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, such as larger research and development staff and well-established marketing and salesforces, or may operate in jurisdictions with lower standards of evidence to bring products to market. For example, we are aware that some of our competitors, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Novo Nordisk A/S, Novartis AG, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co Inc., Gilead Sciences Inc., Astellas Pharma Inc., Bayer AG, BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., Sana Biotechnology Inc., Senti Biosciences Inc., Iveric Bio Inc., Apellis Pharmaceuticals Inc., Century Therapeutics Inc., and Allogene Therapeutics Inc., may be conducting clinical trials for therapies that could compete with our cell therapy programs.
