ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
THE BUSINESS
 
Corporate History and General Information
 
CannAssist International Corp. was originally named Iris Grove Acquisition Corporation ("Iris Grove ") and incorporated on May 17, 2017 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions.
 
In July 2017, Iris Grove Acquisition Corporation filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-12g pursuant to Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and became a public reporting company. In June 2018, the Company effected a change in control of Iris Grove Acquisition Corporation. As part of that change in control, the then officers and directors of Iris Grove resigned, the Company redeemed 20,000,000 shares of the then 20,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding. Mark Palumbo was appointed the sole officer and director of the Company and the Company issued an aggregate of 4,200,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Palumbo and a group of investors. In addition, the Company changed its name to CannAssist International Corp.
 
The Company's corporate offices are located at 412 North Main Street, Buffalo, Wyoming 82834. The Company's email address is info@xceptorllc.com, and its website is xceptorcbd.com. The Company’s telephone number is 760-990-3091.
 
Business Combination with Xceptor LLC
 
On July 12, 2018, CannAssist International Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), entered into a share exchange acquisition agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with Xceptor LLC, a private company organized under the laws of Wyoming (“Xceptor”). Under the Acquisition Agreement, the Company issued to the members of Xceptor a total amount of 3,000,000 shares of its common stock, valued at $0.0001 per share, in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Xceptor. Mr. Mark Palumbo, who is the officer, director and majority shareholder of the Company, was an officer and member of Xceptor LLC prior to the Acquisition. As a result of the Acquisition, Xceptor became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company had taken over its operations and business plan. Prior to the Acquisition, the Company had no ongoing business or operations. Just prior to the business combination on July 12, 2018, Mark Palumbo, the Company’s sole officer and director currently and just prior to the business combination, was the owner of 60% of the outstanding membership interests of Xceptor LLC and also was the owner of 3,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company (which constituted 71% of the 4,200,000 total number of shares of the common stock of the Company then issued and outstanding just prior to the business combination on July 12, 2018). Since the Company and Xceptor were entities under common control prior to the Acquisition, the transaction is accounted for as a restructuring transaction.
 
Background
 
The Company has only recently emerged from its status as a development-stage company, and it has limited operating history and is expected to experience losses in the near term. The Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Business Overview
 
CannAssist produces and sells its cannabidiol ("CBD") product, “Cibidinol,” which is formulated based on a process developed by its founder Mark Palumbo. CBD is a non-psychoactive compound found in hemp and cannabis. CannAssist’s initial research and development work, aimed at enhancing the bioavailability of desired molecular structures, resulted in the creation of a line of CBD products, most notably its CBD product, Cibidinol. Cibidinol will be available in a line of consumable and topical products that the Company believes will make enhanced CBD products more available and accessible to consumers.

The Products and Process
 
The Company’s CBD product Cibidinol is made from “hemp,” which is defined as “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.” CannAssist's product offerings are based on formulation and manufacturing processes that are intended to enhance the bioavailability of CBD. Enhanced bioavailability is important as CBD and related compounds are oil-based and thus are not easily absorbed into the body. CannAssist's process is intended to allow for quicker absorption and reduced dosage requirements.
 
CannAssist intends to produce and distribute its product, Cibidinol, and a number of consumable and topical products in various delivery forms including capsules, sublingual drops, films, troches, lotions, creams, sprays, powders and suppositories. We are currently preparing pre-clinical trials for our CBD products with a target date for commencement of the tests in 2019. In addition to Cibidinol, we sell products using essential oils that utilize the same process as Cibidinol.
 
CannAssist intends to provide a line of CBD infused products that are produced with the Company's process of enhancing bioavailability. It is CannAssist's intent to create and maintain a robust product line. CannAssist’s research and development will also focus on studying adjunctive materials to use with the CBD product including (but not limited to) vitamins, anti-oxidants, sleep aids, and other ingredients.
 
Plan of Operation and Presence in the Market 
 
CannAssist manufactures and distributes its products at facilities located in Carrollton, Texas, located at 2210 Hutton Drive, Carrollton, Texas 75006. The Company has shifted its focus from research and development to the commercialization of its products. The Company currently offers a topical lotion containing Cibidinol and plans to launch more products in the near future (which are currently under development). We sell our products directly online through our established website found at xceptorcbd.com. We currently have four active sales contractor distributors with plans to add two more sales representatives by the end of next year.
 
Over the next twelve months, CannAssist plans to solidify its market presence and position by enhancing current and developing new strategic relationships. Products will be sold through distributors and wholesalers and through a significant online market presence. CannAssist will also evaluate the generation of additional revenue streams through the licensing of its manufacturing processes to strategic partners. Specifically, in 2019, the Company plans to expand its product line by adding scents and flavors and concentration levels to its existing products, establish strategic partnerships with farms and other suppliers and engage in clinical studies in connection with its products.  
 
There is no assurance that the Company’s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital, or if additional capital is needed, that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. Accordingly, given the Company’s limited cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company will be unable to implement its business plans and proposed operations unless it obtains additional financing or otherwise is able to generate revenues and profits. The Company may raise additional capital through sales of debt or equity, obtain loan financing or develop and consummate other alternative financial plans. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer and several shareholders may fund the Company’s operations, if needed, during the next 12 months or until the Company can generate an ongoing source of capital sufficient to independently continue its operations.
 
The Company anticipates that it would need approximately $4,500,000 over the next 12 months to continue as a going concern, satisfy its capital commitments and continue its operations in accordance with its current business plan, which will be used to fund expenses related to operations, office supplies, travel, salaries and other incidental expenses. Management believes that this capital would allow the Company to meet its operating cash requirements, cover overhead cost and general liabilities of the Company, and allow the Company to achieve overall sustainable profitability by facilitating the Company’s business.

Pricing
 
We will price our products using a formula that accounts for all Costs of Goods Sold (“COGS”) a sales margin as applied to these costs from 7.5 - 8.5 times COGS.
The Market – CBD Products
 
According to the Brightfield Group (“Brightfield”), the hemp-derived CBD market will reach sales of $22 billion by 2022, as compared to $591 million in 2018. According to Brightfield, main drivers of growth would be:
 

· | Increased investment.
--+----------------------


· | The popularity of hemp CBD versus pharmaceutical products as wellness trends continue.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The evolution of distribution channels.
--+----------------------------------------


· | The expansion of the offering – driven by more product types and constant innovation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
According to Brightfield, 55% of CBD users purchase their CBD products at storefront dispensaries, 31% through local delivery services, and 17% online. Most of the remainder of CBD products are sourced from friends, dealers and cooperatives (8-9% each). Among CBD users, 80% use CBD products at least once a week, and about 41% use them every day. Approximately 4% of CBD consumers are occasional users, turning to CBD products less than once a month. Over half of CBD users have bought 1-2 CBD products over the last two weeks, and roughly 17% have bought 3 or more over the same time period. CBD users tend to enjoy having low or micro-doses of CBD (10 mg or less), once or twice per day.
 
According to Brightfield, the demographic age of CBD users are as follows: the largest group (nearly one third) between ages 35 and 49, and the 26-34 and 50-64 age, ranges each making up 20-25% of the market. Among CBD users, hemp-derived CBD users lean slightly older, more likely to fall into the 50-64 age range, and less likely to fall into the 26-34 age range. In general, significantly more CBD users are female (55%) than male (44%), with that figure being driven up by hemp-derived CBD users, 59% of whom were female. CBD users reflect the general population in terms of income, but within their ranks, slightly more hemp-derived CBD users fall into the lower-income groups (employed but making less than $40K). CBD users are generally well-educated - only 1.3% have not (yet) received their high school diplomas, whereas 15.4% have a graduate or post-grad degree completed. Nearly half of CBD users have a Bachelor’s Degree or beyond. CBD users are the most likely to be married – with 43% having spouses. At least 37% are married among all respondents, and this is the most common status. Just over 30% of CBD users are single.
 
Customer Profile 
 
Among companies that we believe will purchase products from CannAssist, Management will target customers with the following demographic profile when implementing its marketing campaigns:
 

· | Operates as a distributor or manufacturer of consumable goods
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Is a brand firm that is looking to enter the CBD products market
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Generates revenues in excess of $10 million per year
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | Will spend $100,000 to $1.5 million per year via purchase orders.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Also, consumers will have direct online access to CannAssist’s products. CannAssist will target consumers who frequently use social media, make general and healthcare purchases through online marketplaces, and perform web searches for healthcare and lifestyle information.
 
Marketing and Sales Strategy
 
Management intends on using a number of sales and marketing strategies to ensure market share and sales volume.
 

5
-


CannAssist intends to market its products by building a large word-of-mouth referral network once the business establishes a strong brand name and by maintaining extensive relationships with third party cosmetics and consumables manufacturers and distributors.
 
CannAssist intends to develop an independent sales network that will operate on a commission basis. At this time, Management is developing a commission schedule that will provide agents with a range of commissions depending on the volume and type of business secured. Management expects to have three to four independent sales agents.
 
CannAssist’s Management Team, and its sales agents will frequently attend trade shows and industry forums to formalize and secure incremental and new revenue sources.
 
CannAssist is developing preferred pricing models for distributors, manufacturers, and partners to drive volume in desired product segments and to ensure consistent and predictable sales sources.
 
Competition
 
The current market place currently consists of collectives, dispensaries, licensed pain management clinics, and related entities that are licensed to sell THC and CBD based products. There are also a number of online vendors that provide diverse inventories of CBD infused products. Most states explicitly allow for the sale of CBD products that have been produced from industrial hemp and cannabis with limited quantities of psychoactive ingredients. As such, larger corporations that are able to strictly adhere to these manufacturing standards are entering the market with consumable and topical products that feature CBD as one of the primary ingredients.
 
We believe that one of the main competitive advantages that CannAssist will have over its competition is that the business is able to increase the bioavailability of CBD through what we believe to be a unique manufacturing process. We believe that this will remain as one of the strongest advantages that CannAssist will have throughout the life of the business. Furthermore, we believe that this technology additionally advances a more consumer accessible costing.
 
Suppliers, Distributors and Other Strategic Partners
 
We purchase materials to formulate our CBD products from GenCanna Global USA, Inc. and Isodiol International Inc.
 
The Company will lease production and R&D space from Cosmetic Innovations (CI) and CI will provide some outsourced production services. The Company has not yet entered into a formal agreement with CI, but plans to do so in the near future.
Employees
 
CannAssist has 2 employees.

Intellectual Property
 
The Company does not currently hold any intellectual property or trade secret protection on any aspects of its business. The Company had been assigned ownership rights to a provisional patent (Application Number 62/581,605) with regard to the invention “Carbohydrate and cannadibiol complex” that lapsed in November 2018. The patent filing focused on the processes involved to create the complex between the Cannabidiol and the carbohydrate. This complex is the product we call Cibidinol. The resulting material Cibidinol is intended to significantly elevate the bioavailability of the Cannabidiol. The Company currently plans on attempting to obtain patents, copyright, trademarks and/or service marks on its products; provided, there can be no assurance that the Company can obtain effective protection against unauthorized duplication or the introduction of substantially similar products.
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulation
 
The Company’s CBD products are subject to various state and federal laws regarding the production and sales of hemp-based products. Section 12619 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (“2018 Farm Bill”) removed “hemp,” as defined in the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (the “1946 Agricultural Act”), from the classification of “marijuana,” which is generally prohibited as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”). Under the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill), the term “hemp” means “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.” As a result of the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, and since the Company believes that its CBD products contain parts of the cannabis plant with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis, the Company believes that its CBD products are not governed by the CSA and, ergo, would not be subject to prosecution thereunder because the Company believes that its CBD products contain “hemp” within the meaning of the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill) and do not contain any “marijuana” as prohibited under the CSA (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill); provided, however, there is a lack of legal protection for hemp-based products that contain more than 0.3 percent THC and there is a risk that the Company would be subject to prosecution under the CSA in the event that its CBD products are found to contain more than 0.3 percent THC.
 
Furthermore, the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill) provides additional regulations regarding the production of hemp-based products and there is the risk that the Company’s CBD products may be found to be in violation of these regulations. Specifically, the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill) contains provisions relating to the shared state-federal jurisdiction over hemp cultivation and production, whereby states and Indian tribes have been delegated the broad authority to regulate and limit the production and sale of hemp and hemp products within their borders. Under the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill), a plan under which a State or Indian tribe monitors and regulates the production of hemp shall only be required to include “(i) a practice to maintain relevant information regarding land on which hemp is produced in the State or territory of the Indian tribe, including a legal description of the land, for a period of not less than 3 calendar years; (ii) a procedure for testing, using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration levels of hemp produced in the State or territory of the Indian tribe; (iii) a procedure for the effective disposal of—(I) plants, whether growing or not, that are produced in violation of this subtitle; and (II) products derived from those plants; (iv) a procedure to comply with enforcement procedures [ ]; (v) a procedure for conducting annual inspections of, at a minimum, a random sample of hemp producers to verify that hemp is not produced in violation of [applicable law]; (vi) a procedure for submitting the information [ ], as applicable, to the Secretary of Agriculture (the “Secretary”) not more than 30 days after the date on which the information is received; and (vii) a certification that the State or Indian tribe has the resources and personnel to carry out the practices and procedures described in clauses (i) through (vi).” Further, a hemp producer in a State or the territory of an Indian tribe for which a State or Tribal plan is approved shall be determined to have negligently violated the State or Tribal plan, including by negligently— “(i) failing to provide a legal description of land on which the producer produces hemp; (ii) failing to obtain a license or other required authorization from the State department of agriculture or Tribal government, as applicable; or (iii) producing Cannabis sativa L. with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.” A hemp producer that negligently violates a State or Tribal plan 3 times in a 5-year period shall be ineligible to produce hemp for a period of 5 years beginning on the date of the third violation. If the State department of agriculture or Tribal government in a State or the territory of an Indian tribe for which a State or Tribal plan, as applicable, determines that a hemp producer in the State or territory has violated the State or Tribal plan with a culpable mental state greater than negligence— “(i) the State department of agriculture or Tribal government, as applicable, shall immediately report the hemp producer to —(I) the Attorney General; and (II) the chief law enforcement officer of the State or Indian tribe, as applicable.” In the case of a State or Indian tribe for which a State or Tribal plan is not approved, the production of hemp in that State or the territory of that Indian tribe shall be subject to a plan established by the Secretary to monitor and regulate that production. A plan established by the Secretary under shall include— “(A) a practice to maintain relevant information regarding land on which hemp is produced in the State or territory of the Indian tribe, including a legal description of the land, for a period of not less than 3 calendar years; (B) a procedure for testing, using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration levels of hemp produced in the State or territory of the Indian tribe; (C) a procedure for the effective disposal of—(i) plants, whether growing or not, that are produced in violation of [applicable law]; and (ii) products derived from those plants; (D) a procedure to comply with the enforcement procedures; (E) a procedure for conducting annual inspections of, at a minimum, a random sample of hemp producers to verify that hemp is not produced in violation of this subtitle; and (F) such other practices or procedures as the Secretary considers to be appropriate. The Secretary shall also establish a procedure to issue licenses to hemp producers. In the case of a State or Indian tribe for which a State or Tribal plan is not approved under applicable law, it shall be unlawful to produce hemp in that State or the territory of that Indian tribe without a license issued by the Secretary. A violation of a plan established by the Secretary shall be subject to enforcement and the Secretary shall report the production of hemp without a license issued by the Secretary to the Attorney General. In the event that the Company’s CBD products are found to be in violation of these regulations, the Company may become subject to enforcement action as provided for in the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill) and may become subject to prosecution thereunder.

 Furthermore, the Company’s CBD products are subject to the application of laws relating to health and safety of our products. Specifically, the Company’s CBD products may be governed by the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) as a drug. The FD&C Act is intended to assure the consumer, in part, that drugs and devices are safe and effective for their intended uses and that all labeling and packaging is truthful, informative, and not deceptive. The FD&C Act and FDA regulations define the term drug, in part, by reference to its intended use, as “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease” and “articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.” Therefore, almost any ingested or topical or injectable product that, through its label or labeling (including internet websites, promotional pamphlets, and other marketing material), that is claimed to be beneficial for such uses will be regulated by FDA as a drug. The definition also includes components of drugs, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients. The FD&C Act defines cosmetics by their intended use, as "articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body...for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance." See FD&C Act, sec. 201(i). Among the products included in this definition are skin moisturizers, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, eye and facial makeup preparations, cleansing shampoos, permanent waves, hair colors, and deodorants, as well as any substance intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product. Under the FD&C Act, cosmetic products and ingredients, with the exception of color additives, do not require FDA approval before they go on the market. Drugs, however, must generally either receive premarket approval by FDA through the New Drug Application (NDA) process or conform to a "monograph" for a particular drug category, as established by FDA's Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drug Review. These monographs specify conditions whereby OTC drug ingredients are generally recognized as safe and effective, and not misbranded. Certain OTC drugs may remain on the market without an NDA approval until a monograph for its class of drugs is finalized as a regulation. However, once FDA has made a final determination on the status of an OTC drug category, such products must either be the subject of an approved NDA (see FD&C Act, sec. 505(a) and (b), or comply with the appropriate monograph for an OTC drug. The Company’s CBD topical lotion has a NDC code 72519-101-11 and can be referred to as a pain cream. It uses Methyl Salicylate as a monographed pain reliever at monographed levels. All of the Company’s other products are cosmetic or ingestible forms with no claims subject to pre-approval by the FDA.

 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
In April, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:
 
Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies;
 
Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;
 
Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings;
 
Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and
 
Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements.
 
In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of
 
(i) the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,
 
(ii) the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company’s IPO;
 
(iii) the company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or
 
(iv) the company becoming a “larger accelerated filer” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.
 
Financial Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:
 
(i) audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years;
 
(ii) selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited;
 

10
--


(iii) executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies.
 
(A smaller reporting company is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter)
 
However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.
 
The JOBS Act also exempts the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.
 
The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company’s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.
 
Internal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
 
Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.
 
Other Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO.
 
Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.
 
Election to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.
 
The JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period.
 
Reports to Security Holders
 
In July 2017, the Company (as Iris Grove Acquisition Corporation) filed a Form 10-12G general registration of securities pursuant to the Exchange Act and is a reporting company pursuant such Act and files with the SEC quarterly and annual reports and management shareholding information. The Company intends to deliver a copy of its annual report to its security holders, and will voluntarily send a copy of the annual report, including audited financial statements, to any registered shareholder who requests the same.

PLAN OF OPERATION
 
Business Plan and Potential Revenue
 
The Company produces a CBD product, Cibidinol, and other products and plans to generate revenues from sales of its products.
 
For the next few months, the Company will be focusing on marketing and identifying customers to sell its products.
 
There is no assurance that the Company’s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital, or if additional capital is needed, that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. Accordingly, given the Company’s limited cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company will be unable to implement its business plans and proposed operations unless it obtains additional financing or otherwise is able to generate revenues and profits. The Company may raise additional capital through sales of debt or equity, obtain loan financing or develop and consummate other alternative financial plans. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer and several shareholders may fund the Company’s operations, if needed, during the next 12 months or until the Company can generate an ongoing source of capital sufficient to independently continue its operations.
 
The Company anticipates that it would need approximately $4,500,000 over the next 12 months to continue as a going concern, satisfy its capital commitments and continue its operations in accordance with its current business plan, which will be used to fund expenses related to operations, office supplies, travel, salaries and other incidental expenses. Management believes that this capital would allow the Company to meet its operating cash requirements, cover overhead cost and general liabilities of the Company, and allow the Company to achieve overall sustainable profitability by facilitating the Company’s business.
