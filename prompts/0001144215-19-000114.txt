Industry Overview
Based on industry sources and government information, we estimate that in fiscal 2019 the size of the North American lighting and building management solutions market we serve (also referred to herein as “addressable market”) was over $20 billion and similar to the prior year as the addressable market was estimated to be down modestly to flat compared with fiscal 2018. The addressable market includes non-portable luminaires as defined by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association; poles for outdoor lighting; emergency lighting fixtures; daylighting; lighting controls; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”) controls; and building management controls, software, and systems. This market estimate is based on a combination of external industry data and internal estimates and excludes portable and vehicular lighting fixtures and certain related lighting components, such as non-integrated lighting ballasts and lamps. A source of demand for the lighting and building management industry is attributed to the renovation and retrofit of less efficient lighting and building management systems. While the precise size of the North American market is not known, we estimate the potential size of the installed base of lighting and building management solutions to be over $500 billion.
We operate in a highly competitive industry that is affected by volatility from a number of general business and economic factors, such as, but not limited to, gross domestic product growth, employment levels, credit availability, building costs, building occupancy rates, imports and trade, energy costs, and commodity costs, including tariffs. Our market is based on non-residential and residential construction, both new as well as renovation and retrofit activity, which is sensitive to the volatility of these general economic factors. We are not aware of any data that accurately quantifies the split of the non-residential lighting market between new construction and renovation and retrofit activity; however, recent trends developed from industry sources and our estimates indicate that renovation and retrofit activity represents a growing proportion of the total non-residential lighting market. Construction spending on commercial, institutional, industrial, and infrastructure projects has a material impact on the demand for our lighting and building management solutions. Demand for our lighting and building management solutions sold through certain retail channels is highly dependent on economic drivers, such as consumer spending and discretionary income, along with housing construction and home improvement spending.
Our market is influenced by: the development of new lighting technologies, including solid-state lighting, electronic drivers, embedded lighting controls, and more effective optical designs and lamps; federal, state, and local requirements for updated energy codes; incentives by federal, state, and local municipal authorities, as well as utility companies, for using more energy-efficient lighting and building management solutions; and design strategies and technologies addressing sustainability and facilitating smarter buildings and cities. We are a leading provider of integrated lighting and building management solutions based on these technologies and utilize internally developed, licensed, or acquired intellectual property. Solid-state lighting and digital building management systems provide the opportunity for lighting and building management systems to be integrated in a manner allowing for an optimal platform for enabling the IoT that collects and exchanges data to increase efficiency as well as provide a host of other economic benefits resulting from data analytics and other features. We expect that the industry’s addressable market is likely to meaningfully expand due to the benefits and value creation provided by intelligent networked lighting, building management systems, and the IoT. New entrants, including both well-established as well as new software and technology companies, therefore continue to develop capabilities and solutions that are both complementary as well as competitive to those of traditional industry participants.

In addition, there are a variety of other professionals who can represent a significant influence in the product and solutions specification process for any given project. These generally include building owners, federal, state, and local governments, contractors, engineers, architects, and lighting designers.
Manufacturing and Distribution
We operate  manufacturing facilities, including eight facilities in the United States, six facilities in Mexico, two facilities in Europe, and two in Canada. We utilize a blend of internal and outsourced manufacturing processes and capabilities to fulfill a variety of customer needs in the most cost-effective manner. Certain critical processes, such as reflector forming and anodizing, high-end glass production, surface mount circuit board production, and assembly are performed (not exclusively) at company-operated facilities, offering the ability to differentiate products through superior capabilities. Other components, such as LEDs, certain LED drivers, lamps, sockets, and ballasts are purchased primarily from third-party vendors. Our investment in our production facilities is focused primarily on improving capabilities, product quality, and manufacturing efficiency as well as environmental, health, and safety compliance. We also utilize contract manufacturing from U.S., Asian, and European sources for certain products. The following table shows the percentage of finished goods manufactured and purchased in fiscal 2019 by significant geographic region.

 | Manufactured | | Purchased | | Total
United States | | % | | 7 | % | 26 | %
Mexico | 60 | % | | — | % | 60 | %
China | — | % | | 11 | % | 11 | %
Others | 3 | % | | — | % | 3 | %
Total | 82 | % | | 18 | % | 100 | %

We operate six facilities in Mexico, which are authorized to operate as Maquiladoras by the Ministry of Economy of Mexico. Maquiladora status allows us to import certain items from the United States into Mexico duty-free, provided that such items, after processing, are exported from Mexico within a stipulated time frame. Maquiladora status, which is renewed periodically, is subject to various restrictions and requirements, including compliance with the terms of the Maquiladora program and other local regulations, which have become stricter in recent years.
Lighting and building management solutions are delivered directly from manufacturing facilities or through a network of strategically located distribution centers, regional warehouses, and commercial warehouses in North America using both common carriers and a company-managed truck fleet. For international customers, distribution methods are adapted to meet individual customer or country requirements. During fiscal 2019, net sales initiated outside of the U.S. represented approximately 11% of total net sales. See the Supplemental Disaggregated Information footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the geographic distribution of net sales, operating profit, and long-lived assets.
Research and Development
Research and development (“R&D”) is defined as the critical investigation aimed at discovery of new knowledge and the conversion of that knowledge into the design of a new product or significant improvement to an existing product. We invest in the development of new products and solutions as well as the enhancement of existing offerings with a focus on improving the performance-to-cost ratio and energy efficiency. We also develop software applications and capabilities to enhance data analytics offerings. R&D expenses consist of compensation, payroll taxes, employee benefits, materials, supplies, and other administrative costs, but do not include all new product development costs. For fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, research and development expense totaled $74.7 million, $63.9 million, and $52.0 million, respectively.
Competition
We experience competition based on numerous factors, including features and benefits, price, brand name recognition, product quality, product and system design, energy efficiency, customer relationships, and service capabilities. The market for lighting and building management solutions and services is competitive and continues to evolve through acquisitions and consolidation of niche manufacturers. Certain global and more diversified manufacturers may provide a broader product offering utilizing electrical, lighting, and building management products as well as pricing benefits from the bundling of various offerings. In addition, there have been a growing number of new competitors, including lower cost Asian imports, small startup companies, and global electronics, technology, and software companies, offering competing solutions, sometimes deploying different technologies. Asian imports have also increased competition within the lighting market. 
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to numerous comprehensive laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous substances, as well as solid and hazardous wastes, and to the remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, permits and environmental controls are required for certain of our operations to limit air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation by issuing authorities. On an ongoing basis, we allocate resources, including investments in capital and operating costs relating to environmental compliance. Environmental laws and regulations have generally become stricter in recent years, and federal, state, and local governments domestically and internationally are considering new laws and regulations, including those governing raw material composition, carbon dioxide and other air emissions, end-of-life product dispositions, and energy efficiency. We are not aware of any pending legislation or proposed regulation related to environmental issues that would have a material adverse effect on us. The cost of responding to future changes, however, may be substantial.
Raw Materials
Our production requires certain raw materials, including certain grades of steel and aluminum, electrical and electronic components, plastics, and other petroleum-based materials and components. In fiscal 2019, we purchased approximately 90,000 tons of steel and aluminum. We estimate that approximately 7% of purchased raw materials are petroleum-based. Additionally, we estimate that approximately six million gallons of diesel fuel were consumed in fiscal 2019 through our distribution activities. We purchase most raw materials and other components on the open market and rely on third parties to provide certain finished goods. While these items are generally available from multiple sources, the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of materials and tariffs on certain materials, particularly imports from China, as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials, components, and sourced finished goods.
We do not currently engage in or expect to engage in significant commodity hedging transactions for raw materials, though we have and will continue to commit to purchase certain materials for a period of up to 12 months. We monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including quality, service, and price. We currently source raw materials and components from a number of suppliers, but our ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of our products and services may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers.
Backlog Orders
We produce and stock quantities of inventory at key distribution centers and warehouses throughout North America and to a much lesser degree, certain European markets. The backlog of orders at any given time is affected by various factors, including seasonality, cancellations, sales promotions, production cycle times, and the timing of receipt and shipment of orders, which are usually shipped within a few weeks of order receipt. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of future shipments.
Intellectual Property
We own or have licenses to use various domestic and foreign patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property related to our products, processes, and businesses. These intellectual property rights are important factors for our businesses. We rely on copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws as well as agreements, restrictive covenants, and internal processes and controls to protect these proprietary rights. Despite these protections, unauthorized parties may attempt to infringe on our intellectual property. As of August 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,500 active United States and foreign patents. While patents and patent applications in the aggregate are important to our competitive position, no single patent or patent application is individually material to us.
Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our business exhibits some seasonality, with net sales being affected by weather and seasonal demand on construction and installation programs, particularly during the winter months, as well as the annual budget cycles of major customers. Because of these seasonal factors, we have experienced, and generally expect to experience, our highest sales in the last two quarters of each fiscal year.
Our lighting and building management solutions are sold to customers in both the new construction as well as renovation and retrofit markets for residential and non-residential applications. The construction market is cyclical in nature and subject to changes in general economic conditions and fiscal policies. Sales volume has a major impact on our profitability. Economic downturns and the potential decline in key construction markets may have a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating income. Additionally, tariffs have caused pull forwards of customer orders to avoid price increases.
Employees
As of August 31, 2019, we employed approximately 12,000 associates, of which approximately 4,200 were employed in the United States, approximately 7,200 in Mexico, and approximately 600 in other international locations, including Europe, Canada, and the Asia/Pacific region. Union recognition and collective bargaining arrangements are in place or in process, covering approximately 8,000 persons (including approximately 1,700 in the United States). Union recognition and collective bargaining arrangements covering approximately 6,800 persons will expire within the next fiscal year, primarily due to annual negotiations of union contracts in Mexico. The remaining arrangements will expire after the next fiscal year and relate to approximately 1,200 persons employed within the United States. We believe that we have a good relationship with both our unionized and non-unionized employees.
