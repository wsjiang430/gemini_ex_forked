Overview
 
Venus Concept Inc. (referred to herein, together with its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise denotes, as the “Company,” “Venus Concept,” “us,” "our" or “we”) is an innovative global medical technology company that develops, commercializes and delivers minimally invasive and non-invasive medical aesthetic and hair restoration technologies and related services. Our systems have been designed on cost-effective, proprietary and flexible platforms that enable us to expand beyond the aesthetic industry’s traditional markets of dermatology and plastic surgery, and into non-traditional markets, including family and general practitioners and aesthetic medical spas. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a substantial majority of our systems delivered in North America were in non-traditional markets.
 
We have had recurring net operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $224.1 million and $180.4 million, respectively. Until we generate revenue at a level to support our cost structure, we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. In order to continue our operations, we must achieve profitability and/or obtain additional equity investment or debt financing. Until we achieve profitability, we plan to fund our operations and capital expenditures with cash on hand, borrowings and issuances of capital stock. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $11.6 million and $30.9 million, respectively. 
 
While the impact of COVID-19 on our business has largely subsided, we continue to closely monitor all COVID-19 developments, including its impact on our customers, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners, and distribution channels. In addition, the global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has recently experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including increases to inflation rates, rising interest rates, foreign currency impacts and declines in consumer confidence, and declines in economic growth. All these factors point to uncertainty about economic stability, and the severity and duration of these conditions on our business cannot be predicted.

Products and Services
 
We derive revenue from the sale of products and services. Product revenue includes revenue from the following:
 

• | the sale, including traditional sales and subscription-based sales, of systems, inclusive of the main console and applicators/handpieces (referred to as system revenue);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | marketing supplies and kits;
--+-----------------------------


• | service revenue; and
--+---------------------


• | replacement applicators/handpieces.
--+------------------------------------

 
Service revenue includes revenue derived from our extended warranty service contracts provided to our existing customers.
 
Systems are sold through traditional sales contracts, our subscription model, and through distributors. In the third quarter of 2022 we commenced an initiative to reduce our reliance on system sales sold under subscription agreements in the United States. This strategic shift is designed to improve cash generation and reduce our exposure to defaults and increased bad debt expense given the increasingly challenging economic environment caused by the coexistence of high inflation and high interest rates.

We generate revenue under our subscription-based business model and from traditional system sales. Venus Concept Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours ("Venus Ltd.") commenced a subscription-based model in North America in 2011. Our subscription model is also available in targeted international markets in which we operate directly. Approximately 42% and 51% of our total system revenues were derived from our subscription model in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We currently do not offer the ARTAS iX system under the subscription model. For additional details related to our subscription model, see Item 1. Business – Subscription-Based Business Model. 
 
Our subscription model includes an up-front fee and a monthly payment schedule, typically over a period of 36 months, with approximately 40% to 45% of total contract payments collected in the first year. To ensure that each monthly payment is made on time and that the customer’s system is serviced in accordance with the terms of the warranty, every product purchased under a subscription agreement requires a monthly activation code, which we provide to the customer upon receipt of the required monthly payment. These recurring monthly payments provide our customers with enhanced financial transparency and predictability. If economic circumstances are appropriate, we provide customers in good standing with the opportunity to “upgrade” into our newest available or alternative Venus Concept technology throughout the subscription period. This structure can provide greater flexibility than traditional equipment leases secured through financing companies. We work closely with our customers to provide business recommendations that improve the quality of service outcomes, build patient traffic and improve financial returns for the customer’s business.
 
We have developed and received regulatory clearance for twelve novel aesthetic technology platforms, including our ARTAS and NeoGraft systems. We believe our ARTAS and NeoGraft systems are complementary and give us a hair restoration product offering that can serve a broad segment of the market. Our medical aesthetic technology platforms have received regulatory clearance for a variety of indications, including treatment of facial wrinkles in certain skin types, temporary reduction of appearance of cellulite, non-invasive fat reduction (lipolysis) in the abdomen and flanks for certain body types and relief of minor muscle aches and pains in jurisdictions around the world. 
 
In the United States, we have obtained 510(k) clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for our Venus Viva, Venus Viva MD, Venus Legacy, Venus Versa, Venus Velocity, Venus Bliss, Venus Bliss Max, Venus Epileve, Venus Fiore, AI.ME, ARTAS and ARTAS iX systems. Outside the United States, we market our technologies in over 60 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Because each country has its own regulatory scheme and clearance process, not every device is cleared or authorized for the same indications in each market in which a particular system is marketed.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we operated directly in 15 international markets through our 12 direct offices in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Spain, Germany, Australia, China, Hong Kong, and Israel. 
 
Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 were $99.5 million and $105.6 million, respectively. We had a net loss attributable to Venus Concept of $43.7 million and $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We had an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $25.4 million and $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Market Overview
 
Aesthetic Procedures 
 
The market for aesthetic procedures is large, growing, global in scale, and comprised of both surgical and non-surgical procedures. The International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery reported approximately 30.4 million cosmetic procedures worldwide in 2021. Total cosmetic procedures worldwide in 2021 was comprised of approximately 12.8 million surgical cosmetic procedures and approximately 17.6 million non-surgical cosmetic procedures. Total non-surgical procedures worldwide in 2021 included approximately 12.9 million injectable procedures – primarily neurotoxin and hyaluronic acid fillers – with the remaining 4.7 million non-surgical, non-injectable procedures worldwide in 2021 representing annual addressable procedure opportunity for our minimally invasive and non-invasive medical aesthetic technologies.
Hair Restoration Procedures
 
According to the “2022 Practice Census Results Report” from the International Society of Hair Restoration (“ISHRS”), an estimated 703,183 patients worldwide had a surgical hair restoration procedure in 2021 and estimated the global market for surgical hair restoration treatments totaled $4.5 billion in 2021.
 
We believe several factors are contributing to the growth in the aesthetic and hair restoration markets, including:
 

• | Continuing focus on body image and appearance. Both women and men continue to be concerned with their body image and appearance. Additionally, since the emergence of COVID-19, people spend more time viewing their unfiltered, real-time images through videoconferencing which increases the growing demand for aesthetic procedures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wide acceptance of aesthetic procedures. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (“ASAPS”), in 2021, people in the U.S. spent more than $14.6 billion on combined surgical and non-surgical aesthetic procedures. The number of non-surgical procedures has increased, growing 44% from 2020 to 2021, and the number of surgical procedures growing 54% over the same period.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broader availability of minimally and non-invasive procedures. Technological developments have resulted in the introduction of a broader range of safe, effective, easy-to-use, and low-cost minimally invasive and non-invasive aesthetic procedures, with fewer side effects. This has resulted in wider adoption of aesthetic procedures by practitioners. According to the ASAPS, nonsurgical procedures were performed more often in 2021 than surgical procedures. There has also been a market shift to less invasive hair restoration procedures such as follicular unit extraction ("FUE") surgery which, according to ISHRS, is the most common method among males (75.4%), followed by strip/linear harvesting (21.3%) and combination strip and FUE (3.3%). The most common type of procedure among female patients is also FUE (57.0%) followed by strip/linear harvesting (41.7%).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased physician focus and changing practitioner economics. Managed care and government payor reimbursement restrictions in the United States, and similar payment-related constraints outside of the United States, are motivating practitioners to establish or expand their elective aesthetic practices with procedures that are paid for directly by patients. As a result, in addition to traditional aesthetic providers, non-traditional providers have begun to perform these procedures.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasingly affordable treatment solutions. New, lower cost technologies combined with procedure pricing pressures will broaden the patient population for minimally invasive and non-invasive aesthetic procedures, which we believe will continue to contribute to increased market demand.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aesthetic Solutions
 
Traditional Aesthetic Treatment Options and Their Limitations
 
We believe that several limitations have restricted the growth of traditional aesthetic technologies and that patients who do not require significant skin tightening, cellulite reduction, circumferential reduction or body contouring will explore non-invasive alternatives to minimize the pain, expense, downtime, and surgical risks associated with current invasive procedures. Most existing non-invasive procedures are based on various forms of directed energy treatments, such as Radiofrequency (“RF”), Intense Pulsed Light (“IPL”), lasers using various wavelengths, shockwave therapy or ultrasound.
 
Most traditional aesthetic technologies present several limitations, including surgical risks, potentially painful and medication-dependent surgical recovery, pain and discomfort, potentially undesired results. In addition, traditional aesthetic technologies are limited in efficacy by the relative skill and technique of the operator, and patient access to invasive treatments is often limited by cost. 
 
Our Aesthetic Technology Solutions 
 
We have designed a suite of medical aesthetic systems that use our proprietary multipolar pulsed technology ("(MP)2") technology to address the limitations of existing medical aesthetic technologies and procedures. Our systems have the following characteristics:
 

• | Non-invasive. Our systems use technologies that are primarily non-invasive. Our core (MP)2 technology combines multipolar RF and magnetic pulse synthesizers to homogenously raise temperature over the entire treatment area and multiple skin layers. Controlled, targeted, uniform heat distribution and the ability to maintain clinically acceptable therapeutic temperature for the entire treatment results in no heat spikes (thermal surges) and eliminates the need for topical cooling agents.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy-to-use and delegable technology. We believe that the effective use of our aesthetic systems is not technique-dependent and requires limited training and skills to obtain successful aesthetic results. This allows physicians to leverage their own time and increase throughput since procedures can be performed by non-physician operators, subject to local regulations. We design our systems to be easy to operate with this benefit in mind.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Results for broad range of skin types. Our (MP)2 technology uses proprietary algorithms that harness the benefits of both RF and Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy (“PEMF”) therapy. This resulting energy matrix penetrates multiple layers of skin, raising temperature homogenously and effectively. We believe this type of skin penetration improves treated conditions and provides visible results for a broad range of skin types.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology enables products to be designed for affordability. Our technology enables us to focus on designing and manufacturing products at an affordable cost. We offer our products at competitive prices without sacrificing quality, while maintaining our margin objectives. Our competitive prices and subscription model also allow our customers the ability to offer more affordable treatment options to patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Advantages for the Aesthetic Market
 

• | Expands potential market. Our subscription-based model enables us to sell to both traditional and non-traditional customers without the involvement of third-party lenders, which allows us to reach many customers who choose not to purchase competitors’ aesthetic products because of the barriers associated with equipment financing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintains strong customer relationships. Our “high-touch” customer philosophy leads to continuous interactions with our customers and enables us to cultivate strong and long-term relationships.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Controls secondary market resales. Our 30-day activation code technology also reduces the risk that our products will be resold in the secondary market without authorization. This allows us to control the various distribution channels for our products and maximize the value of our products after purchase.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Opportunities for access to the newest available Venus Concept’s technology and revenue enhancement. Where the conditions are appropriate, our customers have the opportunity to upgrade into our newest available or alternative technology. In addition, our customers participate in the most current marketing and branding activities we offer. Our quarterly educational webinars, online promotions events, and periodic remote consultations lead to continuing client interaction and the ability to expand the client’s business and service offerings.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Advantages for Our Customers in the Aesthetic Market
 

• | Return on investment. By spreading payments over a 36-month period, our subscription-based model is designed to help our customers achieve positive cash-flow from their investment in our systems, thus reducing a portion of implementation risk and concerns associated with large initial capital outlays.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expansion of services. Our aesthetic systems allow customers to expand the services offered within their practices. A majority of our systems can be used to treat more than one clinical indication, and some products can be purchased as a modular platform that can be modified to match the needs of a growing aesthetic business. To the extent we are successful in receiving FDA and other clearances for additional clinical indications, the value of our modular platform technologies to customer practices may be further enhanced.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage physician time and clinic infrastructure. Subject to the local laws of each state in the United States and in other jurisdictions, our physician customers may delegate these non-invasive procedures to nurse practitioners, technicians, and other non-physician trained operators as long as the systems are operated under the physician supervision. We believe that this creates leverage to save physician time and requires the use of less practice infrastructure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer Business Development program. Our customer business development program offers marketing and clinical support to our customers. These services focus on improving practice or clinic revenue performance, as well as the customers’ overall financial and business metrics. In addition, we provide remote educational programs that focus on driving best practices and increasing clinical and economic performance of our customers.

Hair Restoration Solutions
 
The treatments for hair loss can broadly be divided between non-surgical options and surgical procedures.
 
Non-Surgical Options
 
Traditional non-surgical options for hair loss include prescription therapeutics and non-prescription remedies. In the United States, the FDA has authorized two prescription therapeutics for hair loss: Rogaine which is applied topically, and Propecia, a pharmaceutical ingested in pill form. Both Rogaine and Propecia have several drawbacks, including limited efficacy in some individuals, potential side effects and the need for strict patient compliance for the treatment to have meaningful effect.
Surgical Procedures
 
Surgical procedures to address hair loss, specifically follicular unit transplantation (“FUT Strip Surgery”) and FUE, continue to evolve and become more popular. FUE is significantly less invasive than FUT Strip Surgery, which requires the physician to surgically remove a large strip of the patient’s scalp and implant individual hair follicles from the strip into the patient’s scalp. This procedure results in a linear scar at the donor area. In a FUE procedure, the physician or technician removes individual hair follicles from the patient’s scalp without removing a strip of tissue. Because a strip of the patient’s scalp is not removed, a FUE procedure avoids a long linear scar and reduces the post-operative pain and numbness associated with strip surgery. FUE can be performed with manual hand-held punches, automated hand-held devices (e.g., NeoGraft) ("Manual FUE") or robotically with the ARTAS System.
Limitation of Traditional Hair Loss Treatment Options
 
While FUT Strip Surgery and Manual FUE can provide significant, long-term results in restoring hair, there are several limitations associated with these procedures, including the demanding training and major investment of time required for a physician or technician to become proficient, the labor intensive nature of the procedures, the ability of physician or technician to effective create sites for hair follicle implantation, and the risk of inconsistence of physician or technician performance.

Our Hair Loss Treatment Solutions
 
The ARTAS Solution
 
We believe the ARTAS System addresses many of the shortcomings of other hair restoration procedures. The ARTAS System is capable of robotically assisting a physician through many of the most challenging steps of the hair restoration process, including the dissection of hair follicles, site planning and recipient site making. We believe, with this assistance, the ARTAS System can help shorten the often-long learning curve for both physicians and technicians to become proficient in performing hair restoration procedures. In addition, we believe that by assisting the physician and technicians with many of the repetitive tasks associated with the hair restoration procedures, the ARTAS System can make hair restoration procedures less labor intensive and can reduce operator fatigue, thereby reducing inconsistent results. Further, we believe the ARTAS System’s site making functionality, which includes an enhanced imaging system and sophisticated algorithms, helps physicians avoid damaging existing follicles and enables them to create a more natural, aesthetically pleasing outcome for the patient. In March 2018, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to expand the ARTAS technology to include implantation of harvested hair follicles into our ARTAS iX System for sale in the United States. As of December 1, 2022, the ARTAS iX conforms to the European Union’s (“EU”) “Low Voltage Directive” which allows us to affix the CE Mark and market the ARTAS iX system in the EU.
 
We strategically market the ARTAS System to hair restoration surgeons, dermatologists, plastic surgeons and aesthetic physicians. We believe we can reach our target physician customers effectively through focused marketing efforts. These efforts include participation in trade shows, scientific meetings, educational symposiums, webinars, online advertising and other activities. For physicians who purchase the ARTAS System, we provide comprehensive clinical training and practice-based marketing support. For example, we believe we help our physician customers increase the number of procedures performed by assigning a business development manager (“BDM”) to aid in building the physician-customer’s hair restoration practice. Support from a BDM includes assistance with recruitment, consultation, and conversion of patients. Additionally, BDMs deploy patient marketing materials, assist with social media and digital marketing strategies, and provide other marketing and sales support.
 
Advantages of the ARTAS Procedure 
 
Patient Value
 
We believe the ARTAS System significantly improves the patient experience and outcome in hair transplantation procedures in the following ways:
 

• | The ARTAS procedure provides patients with a minimally invasive, less painful alternative to FUT Strip Surgery. The ARTAS System has a faster recovery time and avoids the long linear scar at the back of the patient’s head.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Through the ARTAS System, the dissection of grafts is performed in a manner that leaves only small pinpoint scars that heal faster and are less detectable than the larger post-operative linear scar that would be produced from FUT Strip Surgery. As a result, an ARTAS procedure can, in many cases, offer a shorter recovery time and can enable patients to resume their daily lifestyle faster than with strip surgery. In addition, the ARTAS procedure allows patients to wear their hair shorter without a noticeable scar.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ARTAS site making functionality translates the physician-patient site design onto the patient’s recipient area. The ARTAS System’s enhanced imaging system and sophisticated algorithms enable the ARTAS System to rapidly create recipient sites at precise depths, replicate pre-existing hair angles, avoid damaging the healthy pre-existing hair and adjust the distribution of the recipient sites to optimally fill in the transplantation area. We believe these elements can contribute to a superior aesthetic outcome.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Physician Value
 
We believe the ARTAS System provides physicians with compelling economic benefits and enables physicians to achieve consistent reproducible results. As a result, we believe the ARTAS procedure also offers an attractive addition to existing dermatology, plastic surgery or aesthetics practices whether they do or do not currently provide hair restoration procedures in the following ways:

• | We believe the ARTAS System and ARTAS 3D pre-operative planning software application provide compelling benefits for physicians. The ARTAS System’s image-guided robotic capabilities allow physicians to perform procedures with fewer staff than what might be required for a traditional FUT Strip Surgery or a Manual FUE procedure. With the robotic assistance provided by the ARTAS System, we believe physicians and technicians will be able to perform the complicated, repetitive and often tedious task of dissecting hair grafts with less fatigue and greater productivity than would be possible in a Manual FUE procedure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hair restoration procedures are generally paid for by the patient and do not involve the complexity of securing reimbursement from third-party payors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As we provide high quality training for physicians and their clinical teams on the use of the ARTAS System and because the robotic system and its intelligent algorithms assist these teams in performing hair restoration procedures, we believe we can significantly shorten the learning curve necessary for hair transplantation procedures using the ARTAS System. This shortened learning curve can reduce barriers to entry for a new hair restoration practice. It can also ease the adoption of a new technology into existing practices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Clinically-Established Results

Four peer-reviewed clinical publications have demonstrated the quality and consistency of grafts produced by the ARTAS System. One published study indicated average damage rates for the hair follicles, or transection rates, with the ARTAS System were as low as 6.6%, with a second study documenting average transection rates as low as 4.9% in a separate population of patients. The third study documented that the ARTAS System can be programmed by the physician to select follicular units with larger groupings of hairs while skipping single hair grafts, which allows physicians to choose particular follicular units depending on the hair density they are trying to achieve, providing a clinical benefit as measured by the increase in hairs per harvest of 17% and as measured by the increase in hairs per graft of 11.4%. Results were statistically significant with a p-value less than 0.01. This study also demonstrates the ability of robotic follicular unit graft selection to increase the number of hairs a physician can extract for each incision made in the donor area. The fourth study demonstrated that FUE cases larger than 2,500 grafts, or mega-sessions, are possible using the ARTAS System. These peer-reviewed publications demonstrate the reproducibility and consistency of dissection results from the ARTAS System in a diverse group of patients, even as the system is used by different clinicians. To our knowledge, there are no other peer-reviewed clinical publications that demonstrate the reproducibility of results utilizing other products in FUE or strip surgery procedures. We continue to encourage scientific research in the study of hair restoration to improve our technology, solutions, enhance understanding of our industry and educate physicians on the capabilities of the ARTAS System.
 
    9 

  

The NeoGraft Solution
 
We believe that NeoGraft offers a technology solution that complements our robotic hair restoration system and provides an alternative to FUT Strip Surgery and Manual FUE procedures for our customers and their patients.
Patient Value 
 

• | Unlike traditional FUT Strip Surgery procedures, the NeoGraft system is minimally invasive. In a FUE procedure using NeoGraft, rather than surgically removing a portion of the patient’s scalp, each hair graft is individually dissected from the scalp for transplantation. Because a strip of the patient’s scalp is not removed, a FUE procedure avoids a long linear scar and reduces the post-operative pain and healing process, reducing the risk of potential infection and pain.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In addition to treating male pattern hair loss for patients with black and brown straight hair, the NeoGraft may also be used for women and people with curly or light-colored hair.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NeoGraft can be used for fine tuning of small, specific areas of the scalp, temples and temporal peaks.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Physician Value
 

• | The highly ergonomic mechanical NeoGraft system works as a natural extension of the surgeon's hand, allowing for faster and more accurate harvesting of hair follicles. NeoGraft patients may reach their goal with less time in the procedure room or fewer FUE procedures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our NeoGraft system is a lower priced option to our ARTAS System making it a feasible alternative for physicians who do not perform a large volume of hair restoration surgeries.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leading global provider of minimally invasive and non-invasive medical aesthetic and hair restoration technologies and their complimentary products. To achieve this goal, we intend to:

• | Broaden our portfolio of product offering. We continue to invest in and leverage the extensive energy-based technology developed by our experienced research and development team in Israel, and we believe that collaboration with the experienced robotic research and development team in the United States will bring new and innovative technology solutions to the hair restoration and non-invasive and minimally invasive categories of aesthetic medicine.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Apply robotic technologies to new applications. Our research and development teams in Israel and the United States continue to collaborate on the development of new and innovative technology solutions to the non-invasive and minimally invasive categories of aesthetic medicine. We are working on robotically assisted minimally invasive solutions for aesthetic procedures that are primarily treated by surgical intervention, including the AI.ME platform for which we received FDA 510(k) clearance for fractional skin resurfacing in December 2022. In addition, we commenced enrollment for our multicentered clinical trial for treatment of wrinkles on the cheeks in March 2022 and will be working over the coming year with our key clinical advisors in evaluating several new potential clinical applications including treatment of loose skin, stria and scars. We also believe that robotics, machine vision and artificial intelligence can provide significant improvements in the delivery of a broad range of non-invasive and minimally aesthetic procedures. We are currently investigating a number of internal development programs and partnering opportunities for the application of our robotics technologies in a wide range of aesthetic procedures.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hair restoration market. We continue to focus on providing a complete set of products and services to the hair restoration market. With ARTAS and NeoGraft, we believe that our hair restoration product offering serves a broad segment of the market.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand FDA (and other regulatory agencies) cleared indications for our products. We intend to seek additional regulatory clearances from the FDA and other national regulatory bodies and to extend the scope of our existing FDA clearance and CE Mark certifications. Additionally, we intend to expand the scope of marketable indications for our technologies in other markets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand into non-traditional markets. We intend to continue to market our systems to providers of aesthetic services in the large and under-penetrated non-traditional aesthetic market. We believe the ease of use of our technologies makes our systems suitable for adoption by physicians and other providers in non-traditional markets, including general and family practitioners and aesthetic medical spas.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhance our international operations. We have built a direct sales force through wholly owned subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Spain, Germany, Israel, Australia and China, with a majority-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong and a strong and growing network of international distributors and strategic partners. We have implemented a strategy to bolster our sales and marketing capabilities internationally and believe we are well positioned to continue to grow our revenue from customers located outside North America.

Our Aesthetic Technologies 
 
We use a variety of technologies that allow us to expand into non-traditional physician markets. One differentiating technology is our proprietary (MP)2 technology. Our (MP)2 technology is applicable to a wide range of non-invasive skin tightening, wrinkle reduction, body contouring, cellulite, and fat reduction, which have been cleared in the United States, Canada, and Europe, and we have commenced our entrance into the rapidly growing feminine wellness market both domestically and internationally. We also currently have solutions based on other technologies such as fractional ablative RF, IPL and laser technologies, affording a broader set of solution options to address key markets for hair removal, and vascular pigmented lesions, circumference reduction and fat reduction (lipolysis). As part of our strategy, our Venus Velocity, Venus Viva, Venus Viva MD, Venus Fiore, Venus Bliss, Venus Bliss Max, Venus Epileve, ARTAS and NeoGraft systems come with integrated internet of things capabilities.
Our (MP)2 Proprietary Technology 
 
Our proprietary (MP)2 technology employs both PEMF and multipolar RF energy in a synergistic manner. (MP)2 is noninvasive and because (MP)2 disperses heat equally across the treatment area, it does not produce potentially painful localized heat spikes, and unlike other devices employing RF, (MP)2 does not require local cooling during treatment.
 
PEMFs energy is created by running short pulses of electrical current through metal coils, which results in the formation of electromagnetic fields. Electromagnetic fields, in turn, influence the behavior of charged particles, including various biomolecules, within the range of the electromagnetic field to cause one or more desired effects at the cellular level. The non-thermal impact of PEMF therapy is used for aesthetic application requiring enhanced collagen synthesis, for treatment of wounds, and in the management of postsurgical pain and edema.
 
RF energy, on the other hand, delivers radiofrequency energy that manifests itself as heat within various layers of the skin. The heat generated in the tissue by application of RF energy directly affects fibroblasts, extra cellular matrix and fat cells, thereby triggering natural wound healing processes of the skin and resulting in synthesis of new collagen and elastin fibers. In addition, under predetermined conditions, the heat causes contraction of collagen fibers and lipolysis. In our (MP)2 technology, we employ a multipolar matrix of RF circuits to produce heat, which is distributed evenly across the treatment area and volume in a proprietary pattern, which results in the quick and uniform heating of the skin layers without overheating any particular area of the skin.

Elements of (MP)2 Technology 
 


Benefits of (MP)2 Technology 
 
Our proprietary (MP)2 technology enables medical and aesthetic practitioners to offer a wide range of non-invasive skin tightening and body contouring solutions with a technology that is cleared for various indications by the FDA, Health Canada and the EU (CE Mark). Additional benefits of using our (MP)2 technology include: 
 

• | Delivery of RF energy in a uniform manner. The volumetric homogeneous distribution of heat reduces localized temperature spikes and eliminates the requirement to use a cooling aid, resulting in comfortable treatments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ergonomic handpieces designed to increase comfort and reduce operator fatigue. The (MP)2 technology offers a user-friendly interface designed to facilitate intuitive operation, and in most cases does not require an extensive training process.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Additional Key Technologies 
 
In addition to our core (MP)2 technology, we have technologies that use fractional RF (delivery of ablation and coagulation to pre-determined fractions of the skin), IPL and laser technologies that allow us to address key markets for skin resurfacing, wrinkle reduction, body contouring, noninvasive lipolysis and circumference reduction, hair removal, acne treatment and treatment of vascular and pigmented lesions. In offering these solutions in the markets where we have marketing clearances or approvals, our goal is to provide improved technologies that are safe and effective for their intended uses and economically viable for our customers.
Fractional Ablative RF 
 
Fractional ablative/coagulative techniques improve the appearance of skin surfaces by micro-injuring the skin in a fractional manner to trigger a healing response in the treated area. This both tightens the skin and elicits collagen formation, thus rejuvenating the skin surface. Because our fractional RF technology does not use lasers or other light technologies, which are skin color dependent, fractional RF can be used on patients of all skin tones. Fractional RF technology has been incorporated into our Venus Viva applicator, supported by our Venus Viva, Venus Viva MD and Venus Versa systems.
Intense Pulsed Light 
 
Our IPL devices employ non-laser high intensity light sources as part of a high-output flash lamp to produce a broad wavelength of non-coherent light, usually in the 400 to 1200 nm range, that may be further filtered to narrower bands per specific absorption coefficients of predetermined chromophore targets and may be applied to remove unwanted hair as well as vascular and pigmented lesions.
 
We have incorporated IPL technology into our Venus Versa system to expand that treatment offering and to build a modular, upgradable platform that affords a comprehensive solution for common aesthetic treatments. Specifically, the IPL capability permits users of the Venus Versa systems to offer their patients the service options of removing unwanted hair, treating acne vulgaris, and treating vascular and pigmented dermal lesions.

Diode Lasers 
 
Diode laser technology is a recognized technology for hair removal and lipolysis. The Venus Velocity and Venus Epileve systems achieve hair removal, permanent hair reduction and treatment of ingrown hair using the diode laser. Both devices employ the laser energy to the treatment area through a chilled sapphire light guide that conductively cools the skin surface simultaneously with the delivery of laser energy that is absorbed in the hair follicle pigment, thereby maintaining a lower temperature in the epidermis to enhance the comfort of the procedure and avoid potential epidermal damage while destroying the hair for hair removal. The Venus Velocity and the Venus Epileve systems allow us to expand our offering in the hair reduction market, which is one of the most popular non-invasive energy-based aesthetic procedures in the United States.
 
Our laser technology is also incorporated into our Venus Bliss and Venus Bliss Max devices. The diode laser system is intended for non-invasive lipolysis of the abdomen and flanks in individuals with a Body Mass Index of 30 or less. The 1064 nm laser emission performs hyperthermic treatment of the subcutaneous tissue layers and generates an injury to adipocytes (fat cells) through direct heating. The disrupted fat cells and other cellular debris are then removed through the body naturally.
 
Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) 
 
Electrical Muscular Stimulation (“EMS”) employs electrical pulses of predetermined frequencies, durations, and intensities for elicitation of healthy muscle contraction. EMS employs its cycled stimuli of muscles’ warm up contraction/relaxation of the treated area via two electrodes. We have incorporated EMS technology into Bliss Max and our upcoming Astera device to create comprehensive multi-treatment body solutions.
 
Micro-Coring
 
Micro-coring employs a mechanical rotating needle assembly for fractional removal of portions of epidermal and dermal layers of the skin. The sub-millimetric excised skin columns are evacuated from the skin using a vacuum and the triggered demarcated wound healing process results in fractional skin resurfacing through the mechanisms of re-epithelization and deposition of newly synthesized collagen. The micro-coring procedure has been initially used in the ARTAS device for harvesting and implantation of hair follicles. In skin treatment, micro-coring is used by our robotic AI.ME device for fractional skin resurfacing.
 
Our Robotic Technology
 
We believe our robotic technology has improved multiple phases of the hair transplantation procedure, which include harvesting, recipient site making and implantation.
 
Harvesting
 
During the harvesting phase of an ARTAS hair restoration procedure, the robotic arm and integrated vision system work in tandem to identify the optimal hair follicles to be used in the procedure. The ARTAS vision system uses proprietary algorithms to identify individual hair follicles, growth angle, density, thickness, length and follicle grouping and to determine which grafts to dissect and the optimal order in which they should be dissected. The algorithms recalculate 60 times per second, accommodating patient movement, to provide the physician with accurate up-to-date information during the course of the procedure. We believe these assessments directly correlate to the quality of the outcome, the state of the donor area and the potential viability for subsequent harvesting for future transplantation procedures.
 
Once optimal hair follicles for transplant are identified by the ARTAS vison system, these follicles are dissected using a sharp needle to score the epidermis and a punch, coaxial with the needle, to separate the graft from the surrounding tissue. In the final step of the harvesting phase, the grafts are removed by the physician or the technician, cleaned, inspected, and prepared for implantation. During the procedure, the physician can customize the dissection incisions by choosing a needle and punch that will produce 0.8mm, 0.9mm or 1.0mm incisions.
 
The needle travels at speeds that produce targeted precision and a cleanly scored incision. In a clinical setting, the ARTAS System has been shown to move from graft to graft at a rate of approximately one to three seconds, thereby enabling the ARTAS System to dissect a graft every two to five seconds, or approximately 720 to over 1,800 grafts per hour. 
 
    14 

  

Recipient Site Making 
 
Prior to the ARTAS System, creating sites to receive harvested grafts was performed manually using a hand-held tool or needle to create hundreds or thousands of tiny incisions in the scalp. This is a critical step as it creates the hair pattern in which the harvested grafts will grow.
 
The ARTAS System site making functionality incorporates artificial intelligence and robotics precision to strategically make surgical incision sites for implanting hair follicles, while identifying and avoiding injuring healthy follicles in proximity of the implantation sites. This allows the patient’s hair to look more natural and prevents damaging existing healthy hair in the transplant area which we believe results in patients with more hair than if the sites were created manually.
 
Robotic recipient site making is performed by the physician, who develops the ARTAS System treatment plan, or map, identifying where to make the incisions on the patient’s scalp. The treatment plan is prepared using three-dimension modeling software that takes a picture of the patient’s recipient area and generates a three-dimensional map that is utilized by the ARTAS System. With entry angle accuracy, consistency and precise depth control, the ARTAS System creates the recipient sites using a small solid core needle or a blade at a rate of approximately 2,500 to 3,000 sites per hour, which is significantly faster than the approximately 1,500 sites per hour achieved manually.
 
Implantation
 
Customers utilizing an ARTAS iX System can utilize the robotic functionality of the system to assist in implanting the dissected follicles. We believe this robotic implantation functionality will help further shorten the learning curve, improve the consistency and reproducibility of results by protecting permanent hair, reduce inconsistencies associated with manual implantation, potentially reduce the amount of time each graft spends outside of the scalp and decrease the overall time required for implantation.

Products in Development 
 
Our ongoing research and development activities are primarily focused on improving and enhancing our current technologies, products, and services, as well as expanding our current product offering with the introduction of new products for different aesthetic, medical and hair restoration applications. We are currently developing the following products and technologies:
 
Skin Resurfacing on the AI.ME Platform
 
The skin resurfacing technology contained in our AI.ME platform is intended to provide a non-surgical alternative to lift and tighten skin for procedures typically requiring surgical intervention. It uses mechanical vision, artificial intelligence and robotics to achieve the intended outcomes. The punches utilized for coring are designed not to leave scars on tissue. The skin will be contracted and smoothed after coring by applying a flexible patch to the area which will allow healing of the skin with predefined directional effect. 
 
Venus Astera
 
We are working on the next generation of the well-established Venus Legacy product line. This device is intended to extend the capabilities of the original Venus Legacy system product line by combining (MP)² and VariPulse technologies with real-time thermal feedback and ATC to provide homogeneous heating to multiple tissue depths while allowing for adjustable pulsed suction to further support deep energy penetration. This will result in enhanced lymphatic drainage and improved circulation stimulation. The device will come with both hand-held and hands-free applicators which will include (MP)² and EMS technologies.
Other Developments

Technical and Clinical Support 
 
We warranty our products against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of one year, with certain other products carrying a different warranty correlating to the number of uses the product undergoes or based upon the perishability of the product. Once the warranty expires, our customers have the option of purchasing an extended warranty service contract, which is typically for a term of one to three years.
 
    24 

  

We maintain a technical and clinical support team to field inquiries, troubleshoot product issues, facilitate sales activities and support the commercial activities of our direct offices and its international distributors. We provide immediate response technical support to our physician customers and distributors year-round. In the event that an issue arises, our technical support personnel will work with our customers to determine if a technical issue may be resolved over the telephone or requires a service visit. In markets where we do not have our own service engineers, the service and support of our products is managed by our independent distributors. In order to maximize customer “up time,” we proactively deploy replacement systems, modules, and components to strategic hubs worldwide.
 
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 
 
We have our own research and development centers in Yokneam, Israel, and San Jose, California and use three ISO-certified contract manufacturers in Karmiel, Israel, Mazet, France and Weston, Florida. We assemble the ARTAS System in San Jose, California, while reusable and disposable kits are assembled exclusively for us by NPI Solutions, Inc. (“NPI”) based in Morgan Hill, California.
 
We work closely with our manufacturers and perform final quality control testing using our own employees stationed in the manufacturing facilities around the world. Having over 85% of the production of our systems in close proximity to our research and development and operations facilities enables us to control the entire process from product development through manufacturing and final testing, allowing us to provide advanced, high-quality systems as well as the flexibility to create customized solutions for our customers. 
 
Manufacturing facilities that produce medical devices intended for distribution in the United States and internationally are subject to regulation and periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies. In the United States, we are required to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulations (“QSR”), which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage, and shipping of our products. In international markets, we are required to obtain and maintain various quality assurance and quality management certifications. We conform with and are in full compliance with ISO:13485:2016, CE (MDD→ MDR) and MDSAP.
 
We maintain a quality system designed to be compliant with quality system management and QSR and have procedures in place to ensure that all products and materials we purchase conform to our specifications, including evaluation of suppliers, and where required, qualification of the components supplied. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to support our operations.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As of December 31, 2022, our trademark portfolio included the following trademark registrations, pending trademark applications or common law trademark rights, among others: Venus Viva®,Venus Viva® MD, Venus Legacy®, Venus Concept®, Venus Versa®, Venus Fiore®, Venus Freedom™, Venus Bliss™, Venus Bliss Max™, NeoGraft®, Venus Glow™®, ARTAS®, ARTAS iX®, and AI.ME™. We continue to file new trademark applications in many countries to protect our current and future products and related slogans.
 
License Agreement with HSC Development LLC and James A. Harris, MD
 
In July 2006, we entered into a license agreement (the “HSC License Agreement”) with HSC Development LLC, or HSC, and James A. Harris, M.D., as amended, pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize products covered by any of the licensed patent rights or that incorporate the licensed technology in the field of performance of hair removal and implantation, including transplantation, procedures using a computer controlled system in which a needle or other device carried on a mechanized arm is oriented to a follicular unit for extraction of same, or to an implant site for implantation of a follicular unit, or some combination thereof. Under the HSC License Agreement, we developed the ARTAS System to be utilized as a robotic system to assist a physician in performing hair restoration procedures. In consideration for the license, we issued to HSC 25,000 shares of our common stock, prior to the Company’s 1-for-10 reverse stock split, and paid HSC a one-time payment of $25,000. The license grant is perpetual, and the license agreement does not provide a right for HSC or Dr. Harris to terminate the HSC License Agreement. The licensed patents cover, in general, a method and device for the extraction of follicular units from a donor area on a patient. The method includes scoring the outer skin layers with a sharp punch, and then inserting a blunt punch into the incision to separate the hair follicle from the surrounding tissue and fatty layer. The method and device significantly decrease the amount of follicular transection and increase the rate at which follicular units can be extracted. There are other embodiments not herein disclosed. The licensed patents will expire from 2025 through 2030.
 
Competition
 
The medical technology and aesthetic product markets are highly competitive and dynamic and are characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation. Demand for our systems is impacted by the products and procedures offered by our competitors. Certain of our systems also compete against conventional non-energy-based treatments, such as neurotoxins and dermal fillers, chemical peels, and microdermabrasion. In the United States, we compete against companies that have developed minimally invasive and non-invasive medical aesthetic procedures. Outside of the United States, likely due to less stringent regulatory requirements, there are more aesthetic products and procedures available in international markets than are cleared for use in the United States. Sometimes, there are also fewer limitations on the claims our competitors in international markets can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them. As a result, we may face a greater number of competitors in markets outside of the United States. We also compete generally with medical technology and aesthetic companies, including those offering products and services unrelated to skin treatment. Recently, there has been consolidation in the aesthetic industry leading to companies combining their resources, which increases competition and could result in increased downward pressure on our system prices.
 
    26 

  

In the surgical hair restoration market, we consider our direct competition to be FUT Strip Surgeries and Manual FUE procedures. Many of our surgical device and equipment competitors have greater capital resources, sales and marketing operations and service infrastructures than we do, as well as longer commercial histories and more extensive relationships with physicians. FUT Strip Surgery and some Manual FUE procedures have a greater penetration into the hair restoration market, due in part to having a longer history in the market. Our indirect competition in the hair restoration market also includes non-surgical treatments for hair loss, such as prescription therapeutics, including Propecia, and non-prescription remedies, such as wigs, hair pieces and spray-on applications.
 
We believe that our competitors’ systems compete largely based on the following factors:
 

• | company and product brand recognition;
--+---------------------------------------


• | effective marketing and education;
--+-----------------------------------


• | sales force experience and access;
--+-----------------------------------


• | product support and service;
--+-----------------------------


• | technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pricing and revenue strategies;
--+--------------------------------


• | product reliability, safety and durability;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | ease of use;
--+-------------


• | consistency, predictability and durability of aesthetic results; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | procedure costs to patients.
--+-----------------------------

Government Regulation
 
The design, development, manufacture, testing and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, including the FDA, and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies.
 
Regulation by the FDA 
 
In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. The FDA enforces the FDCA, and the regulations promulgated pursuant to the FDCA.
 
Each medical device that we wish to distribute commercially in the United States requires marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution unless an exemption applies. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorizations applicable to a device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval (“PMA”). The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II, or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness for its intended use(s). Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls and include life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, devices of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
 
Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from the FDA. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA approval or approval of a de novo reclassification petition prior to commercial marketing. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to nine months but can take longer. For products requiring PMA approval, the regulatory process generally takes from one to three years or more, from the time the application is filed with the FDA and involves substantially greater risks and commitment of resources than either the 510(k) clearance or de novo processes.
     27 

  

510(k) Clearance 
 
To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for PMA approval, commonly known as the “predicate device.” A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval.
 
We have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals were not required.
 
PMA Approval 
 
A PMA application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process and is found ineligible for de novo reclassification. PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. A PMA application must also include, among other things: a complete description of the device and its components; a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device; and proposed labeling. Approval of FDA review of an initial PMA application may require several years to complete.
 
Clinical Trials 
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support the FDA’s approval of a premarket approval application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearances. If a device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the device sponsor may need to file an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) application with the FDA and obtain an IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a “non-significant risk” device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards (“IRB”). Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
 
Similarly, in Europe a clinical study must be approved by the local ethics committee and in some cases, including studies of high-risk devices, by the ministry of health in the applicable country. In the EU, physico-chemical tests carried out on the medical device may be necessary in order to obtain the CE mark. These tests must be performed by accredited laboratories for Class II b and III medical devices. The reports and tests are required to be filed in a technical file submitted to the notified body for validation of and obtaining the CE mark. Regulation 2017/745 (the "MDR") applicable as of May 2021 in the EU will significantly strengthen the requirements for clinical evaluation (EC). The clinical evaluation for Class II b and Class III medical devices will be based on a critical evaluation of relevant scientific publications, the results of all available clinical investigations as well as the consideration of other medical devices with the same purpose. Regulation 2017/745 notably requires the manufacturer to carry out a post-marketing safety monitoring plan, which includes post-marketing clinical follow-ups (SCAC) in order to update information about the devices marketed throughout its life cycle, and notably any adverse effects.
 
Post-market Regulation 
 
Any devices that are manufactured or distributed pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA, QSR requirements, labeling and marketing regulations, clearance or approval of product modifications, medical device reporting regulations, correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, Unique Device Identifiers compliance, the FDA’s recall authority, and post-market surveillance activities and regulations.
 
    28 

  

We may be subject to similar foreign laws that may include applicable post-marketing requirements such as safety surveillance. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. A failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of products. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions. For additional information on these potential actions and other governmental regulation risks, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulation” included elsewhere in this report.
 
Fraud and Abuse Regulations 
 
Federal and state governmental agencies subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of medical device manufacturers by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements they may have with physicians and other potential purchasers of their products. Violations may result in substantial civil penalties, including treble damages, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. The Federal False Claims Act also contains “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions that allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the government.
 
Venus Concept’s products, and treatment using our products, are not reimbursable by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs, or by commercial insurance. As a result, many federal and state fraud and abuse statutes do not apply to Venus Concept.

Compliance with applicable United States and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data security requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country.
 
Many foreign countries have similar laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Foreign laws and regulations may vary greatly from country to country. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties, or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
 
There has been a recent trend of increased foreign, federal, and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals, such as physicians, and entities. However, certain foreign countries and the U.S. states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties, or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
 
Foreign Government Regulation 
 
The regulatory review process for medical devices varies from country to country, and many countries also impose product standards, packaging requirements, environmental requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices. Each country has its own tariff regulations, duties, and tax requirements. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject a company to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, criminal prosecution, or other consequences.
 
    29 

  

European Economic Area 
 
In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our devices are required to comply with the Essential Requirements set forth in Annex I to the Council Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices, commonly referred to as the Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with the Medical Devices Directive entitles a manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements and to obtain the right to affix the CE mark to medical devices, they must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body, which is an organization designated by the competent authorities of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. The notified body typically audits and examines products’ Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements. Following the issuance of this a CE Certificate of Conformity, Venus Concept can draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark to the products covered by this CE Certificate of Conformity and the EC Declaration of Conformity. We have successfully completed several notified body audits since our original certification in December 2009. Following these audits, our notified body issued ISO 13485:2016 Certificate and CE Certificates of Conformity allowing it to draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark to certain of our devices since 2019 MDSAP Certificate.
 
After the product has been CE marked and placed on the market in the EEA, a manufacturer must comply with a number of regulatory requirements relating to:
 

• | registration of medical devices in individual EEA countries;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | pricing and reimbursement of medical devices;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | establishment of post-marketing surveillance and adverse event reporting procedures;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | field safety corrective actions, including product recalls and withdrawals; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | interactions with physicians.
--+------------------------------

 
In 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation, which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member States, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of the EEA member State laws implementing them, in all the EEA member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.
 
The Medical Devices Regulation is now effective. The new regulations will, among other things:
 

• | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    30 

  

To the extent that our products have already been certified under the existing regulatory framework, the MDR allows us to market them provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid. Under article 120(2) MDR, certificates issued by notified bodies before May 25, 2017 will remain valid until their indicated expiry dates. By contrast, certificates issued after May 25, 2017 will be void at the latest by May 27, 2024. Accordingly, before that date, we will need to obtain new CE Certificates of Conformity. Furthermore, the regulation introduces UDI, i.e. a bar code that must be placed on the label of the device or on its packaging, and manufacturers will be obligated to file adverse effects reports via the Eudamed platform in case there is an increase in the frequency or severity of incidents related to the medical device.
 
Environmental Regulation 
 
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Although the costs to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations have not been material, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits.
Data Privacy and Data Security 
 
We are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and data security, both in the United States and internationally. New global privacy rules are continually being enacted and existing ones are being updated and strengthened. Failure to comply with any privacy or data security laws or regulations or any security incident or breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized access, use or disclosure of sensitive or confidential patient or consumer information, whether by us, one of our business associates or another third-party, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to: material fines and penalties; damages; litigation; consent orders; and injunctive relief. For additional information on the risks we face with regard to data privacy and security, please see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report.
 
Because the laws and regulations continue to expand, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to evolving (and at times inconsistent) governmental interpretation, compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, orders to stop noncompliant activities, or orders to stop doing business in a jurisdiction.
 
We are also subject to evolving international laws on data transfer, data localization and electronic marketing. The rules on data transfer will apply when we transfer personal data to group companies or third parties outside of certain geographies. For example, there is currently litigation challenging companies’ data transfers using the EEA’s standard contractual clauses and use of third-party cookies. It is uncertain whether such transfers will be invalidated by the European courts. These changes may require us to find alternative bases for the compliant transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States to change vendors, or to arrange for local storage of personal data and we are monitoring developments in this area. 
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 384 full-time employees. Of the total number of employees, 139 were based in the United States, 76 based in Canada, 64 based in Israel, and 105 in the rest of the world. Of the total number of full-time employees as of December 31, 2022, approximately 98 were direct sales representatives and sales management. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 120 full-time employees were direct sales representatives and sales management.
