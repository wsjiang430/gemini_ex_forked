Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview of Our Company
Wheels Up is a leading provider of on-demand private aviation in the U.S. and one of the largest private aviation companies in the world. Wheels Up offers a complete global aviation solution with a large, modern and diverse fleet, backed by an uncompromising commitment to safety and service. Customers can access membership programs, charter, aircraft management services and whole aircraft sales, as well as unique commercial travel benefits through a strategic partnership with Delta Air Lines. Wheels Up also offers freight, safety and security solutions and managed services to individuals, industry, government and civil organizations.
Wheels Up is guided by the mission to connect private flyers to aircraft, and one another, through an open platform that seamlessly enables life’s most important experiences. Powered by a global private aviation marketplace connecting its base of over 12,000 members and customers to a network of more than 1,500 safety-vetted and verified private aircraft, Wheels Up is widening the aperture of private travel for millions of consumers globally. With the Wheels Up mobile app and website, members and customers have the digital convenience to search, book and fly.
Our Strategic Outlook
We have looked to take advantage of our opportunities by elevating the following priorities:
Difficult to Replicate Platform
The investments we have made since our inception in our brand, fleet, service and technology, including through our recent acquisitions, have advanced our development of a comprehensive platform that we believe would take years and significant investment of capital to replicate in its scale and breadth of offering. 
Aspirational Lifestyle Brand
We have built an industry-leading brand that creates broad consumer awareness, attracts new customers and allows us to generate deep engagement with our current members and non-member flyers. Our marketing strategy utilizes a variety of owned, earned and paid media channels. We attempt to target our marketing to consumers who have reasonably predictable demographic or lifestyle attributes similar to those of our current members that are indicative of potential or current private flyers. We utilize targeted, digital marketing to reach new customers and drive awareness. In addition to our targeted marketing efforts, we also invest in certain marketing opportunities that we believe provide high visibility and enable us to connect our brand to programs and events popular with our target customers, with a goal of creating a “halo effect” on the Wheels Up brand. Examples of this include our activation 
with ESPN’s College GameDay each weekend during the college football season and our sponsorships of each of the Capital One’s “The Match” golf tournaments. Our brand is enhanced through partnerships with numerous brand ambassadors, including athletes, entertainers and musicians.
Wheels Up provides its members with a lifestyle program that enhances the member experience beyond our core aviation offerings. Our events include celebrations around popular sports and cultural events, as well as more intimate gatherings hosted by our Wheels Up Ambassadors. Popular examples of Wheels Down events include our members-only hospitality house in Augusta, Georgia during the week of The Masters® golf championship and pop-up celebrations during various notable events. Partnerships with certain of the world’s top lifestyle brands provide our members with benefits and special offers in the areas of fashion, travel, leisure, fitness and more. Core and Business members also receive complimentary access to a full-service concierge through our partnership with Four HundredTM, and a complimentary year of membership in Inspirato®, a subscription-based luxury vacation platform. 
Proprietary Technology, Algorithms and Data Ecosystem
In an industry that historically used intuition and basic industry-wide data to drive strategy and decision-making, we are moving from intuition to algorithm. Technology and data science will be the foundation of all of our operations and strategic decision making. We have invested significantly in extending our technology platform to support a growing end-to-end marketplace that is intended to make it easy to search, book and fly. Our marketplace platform comprises three main elements: intuitive digital front-end interfaces; a middle tier supported by data-driven optimization and pricing algorithms; and a back-end featuring a comprehensive flight operations platform, with connectivity to a network of third-party operators, supported by our proprietary cloud-based flight management system, UP FMS. Each of the elements of our marketplace platform relies upon and fuel a powerful data ecosystem containing data generated from within our systems, as well as from external industry sources.
Strategic Relationship with Delta 
In January 2020, we entered into a long-term Commercial Cooperation Agreement (as amended, the “CCA”) with Delta. We have seen this relationship drive significant value through certain strategic initiatives, such as offering Delta Medallion status and SkyMiles to Wheels Up members, co-marketing to top Delta customers and collaboration across Wheels Up and Delta Corporate Sales teams. Delta is also a significant stockholder in Wheels Up and Delta has the right to designate two members of the Wheels Up board of directors (the “Board”). The participation of Delta on our Board adds tremendous strength, breadth of experience and industry expertise to our leadership team.
Development and Integration Strategy
Since May 2019, we have completed multiple strategic transactions to accelerate our marketplace strategy of making private aviation more accessible.
•Scaling our “Asset-Right” Fleet of Aircraft — We expanded the breadth and depth of our fleet with the addition of owned, leased, and managed aircraft across all cabin class categories.
•Broadening and Streamlining our Capabilities — We acquired direct control over our owned and leased fleet operations with a nationwide footprint, added in-house maintenance capabilities, including heavy maintenance, and diversified our operations with the addition of aircraft management, wholesale flight operations and special mission capabilities.
•Acquisition and Integration of Air Partner — In April 2022, we acquired Air Partner plc (“Air Partner”), a United Kingdom-based international aviation services group with operations in 18 locations across four continents. We believe that Air Partner’s international capabilities provide us the opportunity to extend additional benefits to our members flying internationally, as well as access a new base of charter and cargo customers due to Air Partner’s longstanding relationships built over its 60-year history.
•Driving Additional Customer Demand — We added thousands of flyers to our platform, including retail, corporate and wholesale customers. Additionally, our strategic relationship with Delta provides exposure to high-value Delta individual and corporate customers.
•Adding Advanced Proprietary Technology — In 2022, we completed the transition of our entire owned aircraft fleet to our UP FMS system. UP FMS is also currently utilized by approximately 100 aircraft owners and operators, with close to 2,000 aircraft on the system. The UP FMS system facilitates fleet optimization and allows third party owners and operators to access Wheels Up demand. We expect UP FMS to attract more aircraft owners and operators to our marketplace, which we anticipate will drive additional benefits through fleet optimization and “Asset-Right” aircraft availability.
Our Business Model
Our Products and Services
While we offer numerous products and services to our customers and industry partners, we generate revenue within four main categories:
•Membership Revenue — We generate membership revenue from initiation and annual renewal fees across our Connect, Core and Business membership tiers. We believe this membership revenue is highly visible and largely recurring in nature.
•Flight Revenue — Flight revenue is generated by both member and non-member usage of flight services. Non-members include wholesale customers and customers who purchase using the Wheels Up mobile app and website. Flight revenue may also be generated through the use of pre-purchased amounts of dollar-denominated credits that can be applied to future costs incurred by members, including flight services, annual dues, and other incidental costs such as catering and ground transportation (“Prepaid Blocks”).
•Aircraft Management Revenue — Aircraft management revenue consists of management fees charged to aircraft owners, recovery of owner incurred expenses, including maintenance coordination, cabin crew and pilots, and recharging of certain incurred aircraft operating costs such as maintenance, fuel, landing fees and parking. We pass recovery and recharge amounts back to owners at either cost or a predetermined margin.
•Other Revenue — Other revenue consists of sales of whole aircraft, group charter revenue, cargo revenue, maintenance, repair and operations (“MRO”) revenue, fixed-base operator (“FBO”) revenue, safety and security revenue, flight management software subscriptions, sponsorships or partnership fees, and special missions revenue, including government, defense, emergency and medical transport.
Our Acquisition Strategy
Our acquisition strategy is an important part of Wheels Up’s business model. A substantial portion of our growth is attributable to strategic acquisitions of aircraft and businesses that provide private aviation or maintenance services. In 2022, we consummated the following strategic acquisitions:
•Aircraft Purchase Option Exercise — In January 2022, we entered into an agreement with Textron Financial Corporation to exercise our purchase option on 32 leased aircraft. The negotiated purchase price for all aircraft was $65.0 million, and we also received a reimbursement of approximately $6.1 million for unused maintenance reserves. The sale was completed in February 2022.
•Acquisition of Alante Air — In February 2022, we acquired Alante Air Charter, LLC (“Alante Air”), a Scottsdale, Arizona based private jet charter business. The total purchase price for Alante Air was $15.5 million, which was paid in cash. The acquisition added 12 Light jets to our controlled fleet.
•Investment in Tropic Ocean — In March 2022, we made a minority cash investment of $10.0 million in Tropic Ocean Investors LLC (“Tropic Ocean”) and entered into a multiyear commercial cooperation agreement. Tropic Ocean is one of the world’s largest amphibious airline and leading provider of last-mile 
private charter and scheduled service in Florida, the Northeastern U.S., the Bahamas, the Caribbean and beyond.
•Acquisition of Air Partner — In April 2022, we acquired Air Partner, a United Kingdom-based international aviation services group with operations in 18 locations across four continents. The total purchase price for Air Partner was $108.2 million, which was paid in cash.
We believe that strategically expanding our operations, whether through the purchases of aircraft or existing operating businesses with similar characteristics, creates economies of scale and allows us to develop more attractive product and service offerings for our members and customers. In addition, we believe that strategic acquisitions and dispositions of aircraft allow us to better manage our fleet of aircraft, and optimize maintenance operations and aircraft availability. We believe that our management team’s market presence and ability to identify acquisitions that we believe are attractive or present growth opportunities will continue to be an important part of our success.
Membership Model
We provide private aviation services through our innovative membership program, offering three membership tiers — Connect, Core and Business — which are collectively designed to address a spectrum of private aviation consumers from those with occasional usage to the most frequent of flyers. Each program requires members to pay an initiation fee and annual dues and provides access to one of the world’s largest combined fleets of owned, leased, managed and third-party aircraft. Our membership model offers a simplified on-ramp to private flying with less complexity and lower up-front cost compared to traditional competitive private aviation programs. 
In addition to their initiation fee and annual dues, members pay for their flights based on a fixed quoted amount at time of booking. Depending on membership type and method of payment, the cost of a flight is generally either dynamically priced by our proprietary pricing engine, manually priced, or based on a capped hourly rate that provides qualifying members with price protection on our busiest, high demand days. For trips that are charged based on a capped hourly rate, the cost of the trip is calculated by multiplying the applicable capped hourly rate (based on cabin class) by the estimated flight and taxi time with minimum flight hours for each cabin class.
Connect Membership
Our Connect membership is our lowest cost membership tier. The Connect membership offers variable dynamic pricing on a per trip basis, flight products designed for lower pricing and more flexibility in their schedule, and want to participate in an enhanced lifestyle program of events, experiences and member benefits.
Core Membership
Our Core membership is designed for private flyers who place a premium on the convenience and flexibility of guaranteed aircraft availability on all aircraft types on short notice, want price protection through capped hourly rates on the busiest industry days and want to participate in an enhanced lifestyle program of events, experiences and member benefits.
Business Membership
Our Business membership is designed to serve a broad spectrum of demands from our Business members, including those for whom we are the primary provider of private flights, and others for whom we may be a supplementary solution to their own aircraft operations. The flexibility of our offering provides our business customers the ability to manage their travel needs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by selecting the specific type of aircraft that our customers believe is most appropriate. As with Core members, Business members receive guaranteed aircraft availability on all aircraft types on short notice and price protection through capped hourly rates on the busiest industry days. 
Prepayment for Flights — Prepaid Block Programs
Core and Business members can prepay for future flights with the purchase of a Prepaid Blocks. A Prepaid Block is a pre-purchased amount of dollar-denominated credits that can be applied to future costs incurred by 
members, including flight services, annual dues, and other incidental costs such as catering and ground transportation. We offer a similar pre-payment option to our Connect members. 
Prepaid Blocks afford members with preferential terms and conditions that may include greater aircraft availability, access across cabin class categories, extended capped rate price protection and other member benefits such as Delta Medallion® status. We have generally experienced greater purchases of Prepaid Blocks from our members during the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year prior to effectiveness of pricing adjustments. We believe that Prepaid Blocks provide favorable benefits to our members, while also providing Wheels Up with demand forecasting opportunities.
Non-Member Flyers
Non-member flyers can sign up, ask questions, shop and book charter flights completely digitally using the Wheels Up mobile app and website. These flyers are not required to purchase a membership but may pay additional transaction fees not applicable to members. They also do not receive membership benefits. In addition, non-member flyers do not have the same aircraft availability guarantees as members and flights are priced dynamically. 
Wholesale Charter Customers
In addition to our retail offerings, we provide wholesale charter services to customers such as charter flight brokers and third-party operators. Our wholesale customers typically pay us an agreed fixed rate for a flight, which varies based on factors such as the aircraft type and date of the flight, and in turn sell the flight to their own retail customers. We historically provided wholesale charter services to customers in North America. However, with the acquisition of Air Partner in April 2022, we expanded our international wholesale charter capabilities and now provide our charter customers with global passenger, cargo, emergency and government services.
UP Global Response
In November 2022, we announced a partnership with AirMed International, a global leader in air medical transport, to bring an array of medical-travel services to our members and their families through our new UP Global Response membership offering. UP Global Response provides the member and up to 11 additional designated individuals with access to air medical transport from nearly any location in the world should they have a covered medical event while traveling more than 150 miles from home. The membership also includes access to a 24/7 global medical services referral hotline, and a transport of mortal remains benefit, among other features. We began offering the UP Global Response membership to our current and prospective members in January 2023.
Sales and Account Management
We have developed a sales organization to capitalize on the various lead generation efforts and customer acquisition channels of our business. Our sales organization includes the following teams: sales operations, sales directors, centralized inside sales, field sales, strategic enterprise sales, aircraft management sales, whole aircraft sales, corporate sales and charter sales.
We also have a Wheels Up account management team that is in regular contact with our members and educates members on the benefits of Wheels Up membership. Account managers serve as dedicated private aviation consultants for members with respect to evaluating options for specific flights and their overall Wheels Up relationship. In this capacity, our account management team plays a critical role in driving membership renewals and the purchase of Prepaid Blocks. This team also assists members in activating their Delta and other partner benefits.
With respect to our aircraft management business, we have a dedicated account management team that is responsible for the day-to-day management of our managed aircraft accounts and owner relationships.
Member Experience
Retention of our existing members is essential to the growth of our business. We drive retention by taking a holistic view of the member journey, from onboarding to member’s booking and flight experience and extending to every moment of member engagement thereafter. We believe each of these touchpoints is an essential element of the 
overall member experience. Member Experience solicits and aggregates feedback from members to share across the organization to ensure all teams are keeping a central focus on our members. Working cross-functionally with Sales, Finance, Product, Ops and Member Services, member experience is tasked with monitoring member engagement and ensuring high member satisfaction and low churn. 
Our Aircraft Fleet
Through targeted capital investments, cultivation of third-party operator relationships and recent transactions, we have aggregated a large and diverse fleet of owned, leased, managed and third-party operator aircraft.
Wheels Up Owned and Leased Aircraft (“1P Fleet”)
As of December 31, 2022, our owned and long-term leased aircraft fleet (excluding our 2P Fleet, as described below) was as follows:

Category | Owned | Leased | Total
Large Cabin Jets(1) | 0 | 2 | 2 
Super-Midsize Jets(2) | 22 | 30 | 52 
Midsize Jets(3) | 17 | 8 | 25 
Light Jets(4) | 38 | 23 | 61 
Turboprops(5) | 72 | 3 | 75 
Total | 149 | 66 | 215 

__________________
(1)Primarily consists of Gulfstream G-IVSP and G450 aircraft.
(2)Primarily consists of Cessna Citation X aircraft.
(3)Primarily consists of Cessna Citation Excel/XLS aircraft.
(4)Primarily consists of Cessna CJ3 and Hawker 400XP aircraft.
(5)Primarily consists of Beechcraft King Air 350i twin turboprop aircraft.
Our owned and leased aircraft operate as a “floating fleet,” meaning that they do not return to a home base. We believe this allows us to keep our aircraft positioned to most efficiently address our member flight requests, ensuring broad geographic coverage with the fleet and limiting costly repositioning flights. Lower repositioning costs can provide Wheels Up with a meaningful cost advantage on one-way and multi-city itineraries. In 2022, we transitioned all of our owned aircraft fleet to our UP FMS platform, which we believe will enhance our ability to optimize our fleet utilization and provide additional benefits to our “floating fleet” operations.
The majority of our owned aircraft fleet are painted in the blue and white Wheels Up livery with the “UP” insignia painted on the tail. We also own certain Beechcraft King Air 350i aircraft painted in special Wheels Up liveries to support special charitable causes, such as breast cancer awareness (pink), hunger awareness (orange) and veterans’ initiatives (camouflage).
Managed Aircraft (“2P Fleet”)
Our managed fleet is comprised of approximately 120 aircraft under our management, including Light, Midsize, Super-Midsize and Large Cabin jets. Under the terms of our management agreements, managed fleet aircraft may generally be used to fulfill Wheels Up member and non-member flights in addition to use by the aircraft owners. Aircraft owners typically pay us a management fee for services, including pilot hiring, flight operations, aircraft maintenance management and other administrative services. With respect to the use of these aircraft to fulfill member flights, the owner of the aircraft receives either a revenue share or a fixed hourly rate for all hours as payment.
Our managed aircraft each have a designated home base at airports across the country depending on the location preferred by the aircraft owner. After completing a flight, these aircraft return to their home base or are positioned to another location for their next revenue flight.
Third-Party Network Aircraft (“3P Fleet”)
We have access to over 1,200 aircraft in all private aircraft cabin classes through our network of safety vetted and verified third-party operators. To qualify to participate in the Wheels Up program, aircraft operators must satisfy our rigorous and stringent safety standards for aircraft, crew and operations. To become approved for use, the operator must complete a three-step assessment process that culminates with an on-site assessment to verify compliance with our standards. Additionally, the approved operator is subject to recurring on-site assessments every two years. As a final step, we verify compliance with our crew and aircraft standards using a safety database system for every flight. Under the terms of our agreements with approved third-party operators, they provide service to members and non-member flyers subject to continued compliance with our flight standards. We contract with operators to participate in our network for periods ranging from a single flight up to three years with compensation to the operator based on the cabin class or other unique characteristics of the aircraft.
Seasonality
The private aviation industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations and changes in general economic conditions. Our operations, including flight revenue, are typically favorably affected by increased utilization of our aircraft in the summer months and close in time to major U.S. holidays. 
Operations
Flight Operations
Our flight operations teams operate nationwide and are primarily responsible for providing services necessary to facilitate flight activity for our 1P Fleet and 2P Fleet. Our flight operations team includes certain flight scheduling and member services personnel either located on-site at certain airport locations or at our office locations. We believe that our dynamic flight operations team is vital to providing smooth experiences for our members and customers, and to ensure safe operation of our flights.
Air Carrier Operations
Wheels Up currently provides its passenger air carrier services through five Part 135 certificates across our consolidated subsidiaries.
Gama Aviation LLC (“Gama”) is a Part 135 operator. Gama is generally the Part 135 operator for Wheels Up branded aircraft, operates one of the largest fleets of managed business jets in the U.S. and provides aircraft management services, private aircraft charter services, and maintenance support to customers and partners nationwide. Gama’s subsidiary, Sterling Aviation, LLC, is also a Part 135 operator, and it provides aircraft management and charter air transportation services.
Mountain Aviation, LLC (“Mountain Aviation”) has a primary operating base at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport and operational bases in Alaska, Idaho, Texas, Wisconsin and New Jersey. It is a Part 135 operator and additionally holds a Part 145 repair station certificate. It provides private aircraft charter, aircraft management, and special mission services, including International Long-Range operations, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations, airdrop and low-cost, low-altitude operations, medevac/casevac and domestic flight operations.
Wheels Up Private Jets LLC (“WUPJ”) is a Part 135 operator and additionally holds a Part 145 repair station certificate. WUPJ provides aircraft management services, private aircraft charter services, and FBO and MRO services. It operates tech service centers at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (“CVG”) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, which provide comprehensive MRO facilities and services for aircraft operated by Wheels Up’s consolidated subsidiaries and WUPJ’s aircraft management customers. During 2021, we merged the operations of our subsidiary, Travel Management Company, LLC (“TMC”), with and into WUPJ. TMC was acquired by Wheels Up in 2019 and prior to its acquisition, was the largest wholesale-focused Part 135 operator of light jets in the U.S. supporting channel partners and businesses, including numerous third-party air carriers, across the private aviation industry.
In addition, Wheels Up Partners LLC (“WUP LLC”) is a Part 135 operator and the registered owner of all of our owned aircraft fleet not currently held for sale, including Wheels Up branded aircraft. During 2022, we merged our subsidiary, TWC Aviation, LLC, which held a Part 135 certificate, with and into WUP LLC as part of an internal reorganization intended to increase the efficiency of our operations and facilitate the 2022-1 Equipment Note Financing (as defined herein). We do not currently provide air carrier services directly through WUP LLC.
See “Principal Domestic Regulatory Authorities” for additional information on our Part 135 certificate operations.
Member Operations
Our Member Operations team is integral to our ability to provide flight services to our members and customers. The Member Operations team is primarily responsible for managing all non-flight aspects of a member’s or customer’s flight experience, including booking, special flight arrangements or services, destination transportation and post-flight follow-ups. In October 2022, we announced our plan to relocate significant elements of our Member Operations team from Columbus, Ohio to Atlanta, Georgia, which will include construction of a 34,000 square foot Member Operations Center (the “Atlanta Member Operations Center”) and the relocation of certain employees to the Atlanta area. Establishment of the new Atlanta Member Operations Center is expected to centralize our critical functions with the goal of better serving our members and customers. We anticipate that the new Atlanta Member Operations Center will be completed in mid-2023.
Air Partner Operations
On April 1, 2022, we acquired Air Partner, a United Kingdom-based international aviation services group with operations in 18 locations across four continents. Air Partner has been in business for over 60 years and provides an array of charter services to customers and businesses with global passenger, cargo, emergency and government services. We believe that Air Partner’s international capabilities provide us the opportunity to extend additional benefits to our members flying internationally, as well as access a new base of charter and cargo customers due to Air Partner’s longstanding relationships built over its 60-year history.
Fuel
Our operations are impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. We have pricing agreements with various fuel providers located across the U.S., pursuant to which we receive agreed upon pricing for fuel and handling/facility fees at each location. We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but sustainable aviation fuel is generally more difficult to obtain due to varying cost and our “floating fleet” model. 
Due to rising fuel prices, on April 9, 2022, we implemented a fixed hourly fuel surcharge to our customers ranging from $295 per hour to $895 per hour across our fleet. On May 2, 2022, we announced we would implement a new fuel surcharge framework effective June 1, 2022. The new fuel surcharge is applied when the cost of Jet A fuel, as published by the Argus U.S. Jet Fuel IndexTM, is more than $2.00 per gallon and is calculated based on estimated billable flight time. In addition, on May 2, 2022, we announced a carbon offset fee will be added to each hour of flight time effective June 1, 2022. The fee ranges from $20 per flight hour to $65 per flight hour.
Safety
Each and every day, our passengers trust us with their lives, and it is paramount that we consistently reinforce this trust with our actions and words. This begins with our uncompromising commitment to safety as our core value.
Safety is a cornerstone of our culture. We view compliance with Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) regulations as a minimum baseline for our commitment to safety. We go beyond FAA minimum requirements by setting higher safety standards in areas of pilot experience, certification (licensing), training, safety programs and many others.
Wheels Up has implemented Safety Management Systems (“SMS”), that go beyond FAA regulatory requirements, across our operating certificates. SMS is a means to identify hazards, mitigate the risk associated with those hazards, collect safety data and act on that data to improve the safety of our operations. Each SMS is managed 
by a Director of Safety and a team of dedicated professionals trained on the elements of SMS. A key component of our SMS is the Aviation Safety Action Program (“ASAP”). ASAP is a non-punitive safety program that enables employees such as pilots, maintenance technicians and dispatchers to report safety related events for review by Wheels Up and the FAA with the purpose of implementing corrective actions. Additional non-punitive safety reporting programs are in place for employees that are not covered by an ASAP.
In addition to our internal safety management efforts, the Wheels Up operating entities are voluntary participants in audits from a number of third-party safety organizations, including the Air Charter Safety Foundation, Wyvern, ARGUS, IS-BAO and independent audits by some of our corporate clients. These audits are opportunities to have outside experts review and contribute to the continuous improvement of our SMS.
Pilots
Every Wheels Up flight is operated by pilots that meet stringent training and flight-hour requirements, which are in excess of the FAA’s requirements and training criteria. Each captain is required to hold current FAA Airline Transport Pilot and First-Class Medical Certificates and is required to be FAA Pilot-in-Command Type-Rated in the aircraft they fly. 
Our pilot selection process screens all candidates for background and safety record. This screening process includes in-person technical interviews and written examinations, as well as a flight simulator assessment if appropriate. Successful candidates must also complete mandatory advanced aircraft ground and flight training in a full-motion simulator. This training is also completed annually. 
We have entered into agreements with multiple, industry leading third-party suppliers to provide factory authorized training for our pilots. These agreements provide training availability to Wheels Up throughout the year for both initial and recurrent pilot training in exchange for a fixed price per training slot. We recently took action to secure additional, nationwide training resources and aircraft simulator availability for our pilots.
Aircraft Maintenance and Repairs
We maintain and repair our owned, leased and managed aircraft to ensure the safety of our passengers, assets and the surrounding environment where we operate. Aircraft maintenance and repair consists of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance performed during line-maintenance and scheduled maintenance events. Our maintenance and repair process also includes procedures designed to maintain the FAA airworthiness certificate of each aircraft in good standing.
Line maintenance consists of daily and weekly scheduled maintenance inspections, including pre-flight, daily, weekly and overnight checks. Line maintenance also includes any unscheduled items requiring repair on an as-needed basis. Based on the location where line maintenance occurs, work may be performed by Wheels Up employees, as in the case of a Wheels Up facility or if performed by a Wheels Up mobile service unit (“MSU”) team, or by an FAA-authorized and Wheels Up vetted third-party maintenance provider.
Scheduled airframe maintenance inspections are defined by the applicable original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) maintenance inspection program and as a function of flight hours, flight cycles and/or calendar-based intervals. We attempt to package these airframe maintenance inspections into strategically timed maintenance periods, with the goal of minimizing maintenance downtime while meeting the OEM’s requirements. This work may be performed by Wheels Up or a qualified third-party maintenance provider. 
Scheduled engine hot section repairs and overhauls are performed in accordance with the OEM’s requirements and vary by engine model. Engine repairs and overhauls are primarily driven by engine hours, engine cycles and/or calendar-based intervals. Except for certain basic maintenance activities which Wheels Up is able to perform itself, engine maintenance, scheduled or unscheduled, is performed by Wheels Up’s contracted third-party maintenance providers. We are also a party to engine maintenance program agreements (the “Program Agreements”) covering certain engine maintenance and overhauls on Pratt & Whitney Canada, Corp. (“Pratt and Whitney”) and Rolls Royce aircraft engines for certain of our owned and leased aircraft.
In support of the maintenance of our fleet, we operate eight maintenance facilities under FAA Part 135 or Part 145 in support of our planned and unplanned maintenance activities where Wheels Up has both the capability and the capacity. Additionally, we have multiple MSUs located in key markets throughout the United States to perform line-maintenance work. To the extent Wheels Up does not have the capability and/or capacity to perform maintenance or repairs in-house, we have entered into agreements with certain qualified vendors to perform maintenance on our aircraft, aircraft components and engines, generally at agreed upon work-scopes and pricing. 
Competitive Landscape
The private aviation industry is highly fragmented. Because we offer products and services that address the needs of most private flyers, we compete with providers across all of the incumbent categories, including whole aircraft purchases, fractional programs, jet card providers and charter brokers. In addition, with respect to aircraft management, we compete with other companies that provide aircraft management services.
We are currently the only private aviation company in the U.S. whose common stock is listed on a national securities exchange. Other industry participants that are not currently publicly traded announced in 2022 potential transactions that may result in their equity securities being traded on a national securities exchange. While we believe we offer differentiated, dynamic services to customers through our membership model, we expect that competition in our industry from both private and public companies will continue to intensify.
The private aviation industry is also dependent on an ample supply of new and used aircraft, aircraft components and maintenance services. These assets and services are limited and also generally sought by our competitors, aircraft owners and other entities, such as governmental entities. Due to supply chain disruptions experienced by OEMs since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, delivery wait times for new aircraft have significantly increased, and prices for and availability of used aircraft and parts has increased significantly. We expect that these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future, which will increase the competition for assets required in our operations.
Historically, we have grown our operations through a combination of aircraft acquisitions and acquisitions of established private aviation businesses. Due to the increase in demand for new and used aircraft and parts, more participants in the private aviation industry are seeking transactions to acquire aircraft or established private aviation businesses. Although we believe we are well positioned to acquire assets in order to meet demand for our services, we expect that absent a significant shift in the industry or change in general economic conditions, the competitive landscape for aircraft acquisitions and acquisitions of established private aviation businesses will persist.
Government Regulation
We are subject to government regulation at local, state, federal and international levels. The scope of these regulations is exceedingly broad, covering a wide range of subjects that includes, but is not limited to, those summarized below.
Principal Domestic Regulatory Authorities
The following paragraphs summarize the roles of some of the most prominent domestic regulators of our business.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) is the principal regulator of economic matters in the aviation industry. As applied to our business, under Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (“14 C.F.R.”) Part 298, DOT oversees the operations of our subsidiaries that operate as air taxis (i.e., on-demand operators of small aircraft). This includes economic authority to conduct business as a type of air carrier, as well as consumer protection and insurance requirements that are applied to the conduct of such business. In 14 C.F.R. Part 380 (“Part 380”), DOT also approves and oversees the performance of public charters that may be arranged by a non-air carrier public charter operator for the purpose of offering to the public charter flights that will be performed by an identified air carrier at a predetermined date and time (in contrast to the on-demand, or as-needed/where-needed, character of our air taxi operations).
DOT also regulates how we advertise and hold out services. In 14 C.F.R. Part 295 (“Part 295”), DOT oversees the sale, holding out and arrangement of single entity charter air transportation (or the entire capacity of an aircraft, in contrast to public charter flights which are sold by the seat). We are subject to DOT jurisdiction as an “air charter broker” under Part 295 in offering and selling our membership program for single-entity charters and in acting as an agent for members in arranging flights. We are also subject to DOT’s jurisdiction as a “ticket agent” as defined by 49 U.S.C. Section 40102(a)(45). In every aspect of our business subject to DOT’s jurisdiction, we are subject to DOT’s statutory and regulatory authorities to prohibit and enforce against engaging in “unfair” or “deceptive” practices and unfair methods of competition pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Section 41712. DOT also promulgates and enforces consumer protection regulations to which we are subject.
Importantly, DOT also enforces U.S. laws governing the citizenship of air carriers. For our air carrier subsidiaries to maintain their air carrier licenses, registrations and other authorizations to hold out and operate services, we must ensure that DOT’s citizenship requirements are satisfied. This means that those air carriers must be under the actual control of U.S. citizens (as defined in 49 U.S.C. Section 40102(a)(15)), and must satisfy certain other requirements, including that each air carrier’s president/chief executive officer and at least two-thirds of its Board and other managing officers are U.S. citizens, and that at least seventy-five percent of its voting stock is owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by U.S. citizens. The amount of non-voting stock that may be owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens is limited as well.
The FAA is the principal regulator of safety matters in the aviation industry. The FAA’s regulations touch on many aspects of civil aviation, such as:
•the design and manufacturing of aircraft, engines, propellers, avionics and other key components (collectively the “aircraft,” as used below), including engine noise and other environmental standards;
•the inspection, maintenance, repair and registration of aircraft;
•the training, licensing or authorizing, and performance of duties by pilots, flight attendants and maintenance technicians;
•the testing of safety-sensitive personnel for prohibited drug use or alcohol consumption;
•the design, construction, and maintenance of runways and other airport facilities;
•the operation of air traffic control systems, including the management of complex air traffic at busy airport facilities;
•the certification and oversight of air carriers;
•the establishment and use of SMS by air carriers;
•the promotion of voluntary systems to encourage the disclosure of data that may aid in enhancing safety; and
•the oversight and operational control of air carriers by key personnel, including directors of operations, directors of maintenance, chief pilots, chief inspectors and directors of safety.
There are numerous FAA regulations that may impact our operations and business. They include but are not limited to the following Parts found in Title 14 of the C.F.R.
“Part 91” contains the general operating rules for flight safety. These rules govern all flight operations, including private and commercial operations, except to the extent that the commercial operations are subject to additional rules found in other parts of the FAA regulations.
“Part 135” contains additional rules that apply to commercial “on-demand” operations. “On-demand” operations include flights for which the departure location, departure time, and arrival location are specifically 
negotiated with the customer or the customer’s representative as well as passenger-carrying operations conducted as a public charter under Part 380. 
“Part 145” contains the rules that govern the performance of aircraft maintenance at certificated repair stations. These include requirements related to the quality of the facility, the qualifications of personnel and what type of repair or inspection work is authorized for performance there.
As the operator of our nation’s air traffic control system, the FAA has an especially important role to play in the management of air traffic, including congestion at the busiest airports and in the busiest air corridors. Also, in the case of a security threat, unusual environmental risk, or other emergency, the FAA has authority to shut down segments of airspace or even the entire U.S. airspace to civilian use, as occurred on September 11, 2001.
As an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) is the principal regulator of security matters in the aviation industry. Among other things, the TSA regulates the standard security programs in use by U.S. airports and aircraft operators. These programs include elements relating to the training of flight crews, checking the identity and screening of passengers, application of security watch lists and cooperation in threat assessments and responses.
Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), also an agency of DHS, is the principal regulator of customs and immigration matters affecting the aviation industry and enforcer of certain public health matters affecting the aviation industry. Whenever our air carrier operations include an international flight segment, we must provide CBP with an advance disclosure of passenger information, facilitate CBP’s inspection of baggage, and help ensure the proper disposal of any foreign-originating refuse on the aircraft. CBP also oversees entry and clearance into the U.S., including with respect to exports and imports, and issues landing rights approvals for aircraft arriving in the U.S. from abroad.
The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is the principal federal environmental regulator. In January 2021, the EPA promulgated new rules relating to the greenhouse gas emissions from carbon fuels used in aircraft engines. This will bring about a change in future aircraft engine designs and approvals and eventually require replacement of engines in future years. This area of regulation is not yet settled. It still is subject to change based on domestic and international laws and standards intended to address global environmental issues, making it impossible to say how such developments might impact our business in the future.
The vast majority of airports where we fly are owned and operated by state and local government entities. These airport authorities claim the right to impose certain safety, security and other regulations so long as they do not conflict with federal law. Airport authorities also have extensive property rights that empower them to impose conditions on leasing and using airport facilities. The terms on which an airport authority might lease or allow use of its property (or other property and services at an airport) can, at times, be on terms less favorable than would be customary for real estate or other transactions outside of an airport environment.
These regulatory authorities have the ability to stop a part or all of our business and flight operations such as by suspending or revoking our certifications or other authorizations. They also have the ability to impose monetary fines and other civil penalties and to make referrals for criminal prosecution. These actions may occur with little or no notice, depending on the circumstances as perceived by the regulators in their discretion.
Foreign Regulatory Authorities
Most foreign countries have their own regulatory authorities that parallel those found in the U.S. The complexity of interaction with the foreign regulators can be magnified by differences in language, culture, legal and social norms, tax and budgetary practices and perspective on economic development and competition.
Privacy and Data Protection
There are many requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction and other processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals. Because our technology platform is an integral aspect of our business and due to our international operations, compliance with laws 
governing the use, collection and processing of personal data is necessary for us to achieve our objective of continuously enhancing the user experience of our mobile application and marketing site.
We receive collect, store, process, transmit, share and use personal information, and other customer data, including health information, and we rely in part on third-parties that are not directly under our control to manage certain of these operations and to receive, collect, store, process, transmit, share and use such personal information, including payment information. A variety of federal, state, local, municipal and foreign laws and regulations, as well as industry standards (such as the payment card industry standards) govern the collection, storage, processing, sharing, use, retention and security of this information including but not limited to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are continually evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may not be harmonized, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As a result, our practices may not have complied or may not comply in the future with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations. The failure to comply with such data protection and privacy regulations can result in fines, penalties and the enforcement of any non-compliance, which could significantly impact our business operations.
Environmental
We are committed to reducing the environmental impact of our fleets, as well as the long-term effects of our overall operations. Over time, we expect to offset the carbon impact of our flight operations through the purchase and retirement of applicable carbon credits or via another established and vetted mechanism. We are also examining other sustainability initiatives, including the potential use of sustainable aviation fuel and long-range investments in other sustainability solutions, as well as operational improvements, sustainable practices at our facilities and a reduction in single-use plastics at our offices and aboard our aircraft. 
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and other intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property (including our technology and confidential information) through a combination of trademarks and trade secret protections, as well as contractual commitments and security procedures. 
We generally require our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements, and certain third parties to enter into non-disclosure agreements. We regularly review our technology development efforts and branding strategy to identify and assess the protection of new intellectual property. 
We own certain trademarks important to our business, such as the “Wheels Up” word and design marks. In addition, we currently own certain domain names, including “wheelsup.com”. 
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The unprecedented and rapid spread of COVID-19 led to economic and business uncertainties resulting from governmental restrictions on air travel, the implementation of quarantine and shelter-in-place orders, the cancellation of large public events and suspending in-person meetings and the closure of popular tourist destinations. In response, we developed and implemented Wheels Up Safe Passage™ — a suite of enhanced cleaning and operational protocols to help ensure the safety of our passengers and pilots through best-available sanitization practices and adherence with up-to-date health guidelines. We continue to utilize these best practices for the protection of our passengers, pilots and employees.
Human Capital Resources
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, Wheels Up and its affiliates had 3,111 employees, including 3,005 full-time employees, and 106 part-time employees. We employ approximately 1,000 pilots across our aircraft fleet. Approximately 87% of our employees are based in the U.S. and the remaining approximately 13% in Europe and 
other territories. Our employee base consists of non-exempt and exempt employees in corporate functions, as well as pilots, other crew members and maintenance positions. Due to the nature of our operations, many of our employees work on-site or remotely to facilitate and support our operations. Our corporate employees generally enjoy flexible working arrangements; however, we encourage certain employees located in the New York City area to attend in-office events and to work in the office on a hybrid basis to promote a strong working and social culture. Wheels Up and its affiliates have not had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining agreements. Wheels Up considers its employee relations to be good. 
Human capital strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, and are overseen by the Board and the Compensation Committee of the Board. Our culture is customer centric and focused on ensuring we are the most trusted technology company in the private aviation and lifestyle marketplace. We aim to maximize the potential of our human capital resources and deliver quality service through a motivating work environment. Employees are encouraged to achieve more through innovation and an entrepreneurial spirit. 
We strive to recruit from amongst the best talent in the industry and reward them appropriately. Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop high-quality management, operations, technology, and other personnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Specifically, there has been increased competition for experienced pilots in the private aviation industry. In an effort to help make Wheels Up the employer of choice for pilots, during September 2021, we were the first private aviation company to offer broad-based equity ownership to our pilots. The ability to provide pilots with equity, along with increasing other compensation and benefits, is a unique advantage. We believe that our attractive compensation programs and favorable working conditions were integral to reaching our initial pilot hiring goals in 2021 and 2022.
Our annual Culture Check Up survey enables us to obtain confidential feedback directly from our workforce to see if we need to make changes or enhancements to a variety of topics such as diversity, equity and inclusion, (“DEI”) engagement, learning and cultural development. 
We want all of our employees to feel like true owners of Wheels Up. Therefore, timely, informative and engaging communication is critical. Through regular updates from the executive leadership team, our biweekly newsletter and intranet news portal What’s Up and recurring all-hands meetings, our objective is to ensure employees are aware of our performance, priorities and path forward. 
In March 2023, we announced the adoption of a restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) as part of the Company’s previously announced focus on delivering positive Adjusted EBITDA in 2024. The Restructuring Plan is intended to streamline the Company’s organization and reduce headcount in areas of the business that do not directly impact the Company’s operations or its customers’ experiences. Excluded from these actions were key operationally focused employee groups such as pilots, maintenance and operations-support personnel.
Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Our success requires the inclusion of ALL — we strive to empower, engage, and celebrate diversity, authenticity and inclusion of all genders, sexual orientations, races, ethnicities, religions, and other identities and cultures. Our goal is to maximize the impact of the Wheels Up team by attracting, engaging, and retaining the most talented, dedicated and passionate people in the marketplace. As a result, we are focused on expanding customer acquisition and maximizing corporate growth through the development and execution of an inclusive strategy that amplifies values, while prioritizing cultural sensitivity across a diverse target audience (i.e., female, BIPOC, LGBTQ+ and other diverse groups).
We have developed our DEI “Guiding Principles” to help ensure alignment across our internal and external programs/processes. Wheels Up has also established a dedicated role within the human resources team to drive our multi-year DEI strategy focused on attracting, engaging, retaining and elevating diverse talent, establishing equitable people practices and creating an inclusive culture. Our current efforts in amplifying DEI include: 
•Establishing target diversity scorecard metrics around talent acquisition, talent movement/management, and employee engagement throughout our entire organization – from our entry level employees, all the way to the Executive Leadership Team. 
•The prioritization of diversifying our candidate pipeline through partnership investments with external organizations including Women Aviation International, National Gay Pilot Association, Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals, RedTail Flight Academy and the U.S. Military.
•DEI focused employee engagement events that will help elevate the knowledge and understanding of diverse communities and inclusive practices.
In addition, Wheels Up has taken a progressive approach in the provision of comprehensive benefits including: 
•Multiple counseling sessions offered through Employee Assistance programs, that support employees and their families’ mental and emotional well-being;
•Health plan coverage for infertility assistance; 
•Domestic partner health plan coverage;
•Health plan coverage for gender reassignment surgery; and
•Parental Leave for both birth and non-birthing parents, including adoption or foster care.
Wheels Up is proud of its DEI initiatives, as we are committed to gaining equity via the development of educational programs and inclusive efforts that will help democratize our industry.
Our Social Impact Initiatives
Wheels Up Cares
Through our Wheels Up Cares initiative, we are committed to supporting philanthropic organizations and initiatives that affect and matter to our company, members, customers, stakeholders, families, friends and communities. The Wheels Up Cares fleet comprises five custom painted Beechcraft King Air 350i aircraft; each plane represents a specific cause of importance for our members, customers and employees. Each aircraft is active in our fleet and flying members daily and serves as a flying symbol of awareness for a specific cause and Wheels Up’s commitment to being a force for good in the communities where we live and work.
Meals Up Partnership with Feeding America
Our Meals Up initiative was created in partnership with Feeding America to help combat the growing levels of food insecurity in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. This effort has already raised and inspired the equivalent of nearly 90 million meals for Feeding America.
