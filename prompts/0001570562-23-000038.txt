Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a performance beauty company with a customer-centric approach to delivering breakthrough products in the self-pay aesthetic market.
Our first commercial product is Jeuveau®, which is a proprietary 900 kilodalton, or kDa, purified botulinum toxin type A formulation indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines, also known as “frown lines,” in adults. Our primary market is the self-pay aesthetic market, which includes medical products purchased by physicians and other customers that are then sold to consumers or used in procedures for aesthetic indications that are not reimbursed by any third-party payor, such as Medicaid, Medicare or commercial insurance. We believe we offer customers and consumers a compelling value proposition with Jeuveau®. Currently, BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) is the neurotoxin market leader, and prior to the approval of Jeuveau®, was the only known 900 kDa botulinum toxin type A complex approved in the United States. We believe aesthetic physicians generally prefer the performance characteristics of the complete 900 kDa neurotoxin complex and are accustomed to injecting this formulation. 
United States
In February 2019, we received the approval of our first product Jeuveau® (prabotulinumtoxinA-xvfs) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In May 2019, we commercially launched Jeuveau® in the United States.
In November 2021, we announced the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial designed to investigate a higher strength dose of Jeuveau® in the glabellar lines. We completed our patient enrollment in the clinical study evaluating the “extra-strength” dose in the second quarter of 2022 and the trial is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. If this indication is approved by the FDA after our completion of all necessary clinical trials and regulatory submissions (including a Phase III clinical trial), we will have the opportunity to offer an extra-strength dosage option, which may make Jeuveau® the first multi-strength neurotoxin and give customers and consumers increased treatment options.
International 
In August 2018, we received approval from Health Canada for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adult patients under 65 years of age. We began marketing Jeuveau® in Canada in October 2019 through our distribution partner, Clarion Medical Technologies, Inc., or Clarion.
In September 2019, we received approval from the European Commission, to market Jeuveau® in all 27 European Union, or EU, member states plus the United Kingdom, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. In January 2021, we received a positive decision from the European Commission to add the 50 unit product to the existing approval obtained in September 2019. We commercially launched Jeuveau® in Great Britain in September 2022, in Germany and Austria in February 2023, and we are finalizing plans for entering additional countries in Europe as part of a phased rollout. 
In January 2023, we received approval from the Australian Therapeutics Good Administration, or TGA, for regulatory approval of our neurotoxin in Australia.
Our Market 
Our primary market is self-pay aesthetic healthcare, which includes medical products purchased by physicians that are then sold to consumers or used in procedures for aesthetic indications that are not reimbursed by any third-party payor, such as Medicaid, Medicare or commercial insurance. By focusing on the self-pay medical aesthetics market, we believe we are not exposed to reimbursement risk associated with a reliance on payments from such third-party payors, and we are subject to fewer regulations that place limits on the types of marketing and other interactions we have with physicians.
According to Medical Insight’s The Global Aesthetic Market Study, within the self-pay aesthetic market, the global aesthetic neurotoxin market is estimated to grow to approximately $6.4 billion in 2026 and the U.S. aesthetic neurotoxin market is expected to grow to approximately $3.7 billion in 2026. According to Clarivate Aesthetic Injectables Market Insights, the European aesthetic neurotoxin market is expected to grow to approximately $662 million in 2026.
We believe the growth in the medical aesthetics market is driven by a number of factors, including:
•increased use by millennials who are increasingly seeking medical aesthetic treatments and utilizing neurotoxins as an entry point for aesthetic procedures due to their minimally invasive nature;
•an aging population together with an increasing life expectancy, which is resulting in more consumers with a desire for improved appearance and well-being over a longer period of time; 
•rising disposable income, with the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reporting that real disposable income in the United States increased approximately 19% from December 2012 to December 2022;
•growing awareness, utilization and acceptance of elective or minimally invasive aesthetic procedures; and
•continued innovation and improved accessibility to these treatments due to an increase in the number of physicians who perform these procedures.
Within the multiple age groups that receive aesthetic neurotoxin treatments, we strategically focus our marketing efforts on the millennial segment which is the largest cohort in the U.S. population. In 2019 there were estimated to be approximately 73 million millennials, defined as individuals born between 1981 and 1996. We believe that approximately 1.7 million females between the age of 30 and 39, which includes many individuals we define as millennials, are considering neurotoxins in the next twelve months.
Our Competitive Strengths 
We offer physicians and consumers a compelling value proposition because:
•Jeuveau® offers the market the first known 900 kDa neurotoxin alternative to BOTOX. The manufacture of both Jeuveau® and BOTOX starts with a 900 kDa complex, includes adding the excipients human serum albumin, or HSA, and sodium chloride, and finishes by vacuum drying. We believe Jeuveau® is the only known neurotoxin product in the United States with a 900 kDa neurotoxin complex other than BOTOX. We also believe an important component of competitiveness in the neurotoxin market relates to the characteristics associated with the 900 kDa complex and the potential of the accessory proteins to increase the effectiveness of the active toxin portion of the complex.
•Enhanced level of physician-customer interaction through a self-pay, aesthetic-only marketing strategy. We have elected to specifically target the self-pay aesthetic market. With a reduced regulatory burden compared to third-party payor reimbursed therapeutic products, there is a number of benefits that market participants in reimbursed markets are unable to achieve, such as an enhanced level of interaction with our physician-customers. Jeuveau® is the only U.S. neurotoxin without a therapeutic indication. We believe pursuing an aesthetic-only non-reimbursed product strategy creates meaningful strategic advantages in the United States, including pricing and marketing flexibility. We utilize this flexibility to drive market adoption through programs such as promotional events, co-branded marketing programs and pricing strategies.
•We offer a unique technology platform. We provide a simple, personal and connected experience for physicians utilizing our proprietary technology platform. We have built and continue to improve our platform with the goal of limiting friction and enhancing the overall experience for physicians and ultimately consumers. We are modernizing the customer engagement with our proprietary “Evolus Practice” app. We not only leverage technology for operational efficiency, but more importantly, to enhance a customer’s experience. We believe the combination of a highly specialized sales force and our technology platform is an effective and competitive model. 
•Results from our TRANSPARENCY global clinical program in more than 2,100 patients provides robust data to physicians evaluating the purchase of Jeuveau®. We believe the comprehensive TRANSPARENCY clinical data set, including a head-to-head Phase III study comparing Jeuveau® and BOTOX, provides physicians with confidence in recommending Jeuveau® to their patients.
•Our management team has significant experience and expertise in medical aesthetics. Our management team has extensive experience in self-pay healthcare markets, in the development, market launch and commercialization of major medical products, execution and integration of business development transactions and understanding of the regulatory environment of the healthcare markets. Key members of our leadership team have also served in relevant senior leadership positions with leading aesthetic companies.
Our Strategy
We launched Jeuveau® in the United States with our own specialty sales organization now consisting of over 100 positions between representatives, management and other sales employees and in Canada through our distribution partner, Clarion. We launched in Great Britain in September 2022, in Germany and Austria in February 2023 and plan to launch in additional European countries and Australia. We plan to expand our product offerings over time through in-licensing, partnerships and acquisitions and by launching our products internationally. The key components of our strategy are:
•Pursue an aesthetic-only strategy to enhance marketing and pricing flexibility along with improving transparency for our customers.
•Launch directly or partner outside of the United States to reach and serve physicians and consumers in those territories. 
•Leverage our differentiated digital platform to efficiently open new accounts, personalize the purchasing process and efficiently deploy marketing programs at scale, including co-branded media.
•Establish a leading medical aesthetics company with a diversified product offering by in-licensing technology, developing partnerships and potentially acquiring products.
Jeuveau® Overview
Jeuveau® is an injectable formulation of a 900 kDa botulinum toxin type A complex designed to address the needs of the large and growing facial aesthetics market.
Jeuveau® contains a 900 kDa botulinum toxin type A complex produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The active part of the neurotoxin is the 150 kDa component, and the remaining 750 kDa of the complex is made up of accessory proteins that we believe help with the function of the active portion of the toxin. Jeuveau® has the same mechanism of action as other type A botulinum toxins. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, botulinum toxin causes a chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in localized reduction of muscle activity. Botulinum toxin type A specifically blocks peripheral acetylcholine release at presynaptic cholinergic nerve terminals by cleaving SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within the nerve endings leading to denervation and relaxation of the muscle.
TRANSPARENCY: Evolus Clinical Development for Glabellar Lines
TRANSPARENCY was a comprehensive five-study clinical development program for Jeuveau® and was used to meet the regulatory requirements for a Biologics License Application, or BLA, in the United States, a Marketing Authorisation Application, or MAA, in the EU, and a New Drug Submission, or NDS, in Canada, for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. The TRANSPARENCY program, which was developed in consultation with the FDA, Canadian, and European regulatory bodies, included three multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled, single dose Phase III studies titled EV-001, EV-002 and EVB-003. Treatment of the Glabellar lines was based on a 4-point photonumeric Glabellar Line Scale, or GLS, where 0=no lines, 1=mild lines, 2=moderate lines and 3=severe lines.
U.S. Phase III Clinical Trials – Composite End Point Versus Placebo
The two identical U.S. Phase III studies, EV-001 and EV-002 (the “U.S. Phase III Studies”), enrolled a combined 654 adults who had moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown. Subjects were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single treatment of either Jeuveau® or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects classified as responders on Day 30. A subject was considered a responder only if both the investigator and the subject independently agreed that there was a 2 point improvement or greater on the GLS from Day 0 to Day 30 at maximum frown. This type of endpoint where both the investigator and subject must agree is known as a composite endpoint.
Both of the U.S. Phase III studies met the primary endpoint of superiority over placebo. The percentages of responders in the intent to treat population were:
•EV-001: 1.2% placebo, 67.5% Jeuveau®, with an absolute difference between the groups of 66.3%, 95% CI (59.0, 72.4)
•EV-002: 1.3% placebo, 70.4% Jeuveau®, with an absolute difference between the groups of 69.1%, 95% CI (61.5, 75.1)
EU Phase III Clinical Trials – Head-to-Head Comparison of Jeuveau®, Botox and Placebo
The EVB-003 study was the third Phase III safety and efficacy study in the TRANSPARENCY Program and compared the efficacy of Jeuveau®, Botox and Placebo. The study was conducted in Europe and Canada and enrolled 540 adults who (i) the investigator assessed to have moderate to severe glabellar lines and (ii) who felt their glabellar lines had an important psychological impact, such as on their mood, anxiety or depressive symptoms. Subjects were randomly assigned in a 5:5:1 ratio to receive a single treatment of 20 units of Jeuveau®, 20 units of BOTOX or placebo.
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects classified as responders on Day 30. A responder was a subject with a GLS score of 0 or 1, as assessed by the investigator at maximum frown. The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint in the EVB-003 study showed the superiority of Jeuveau® over placebo, and established non-inferiority of Jeuveau® to BOTOX. The percentages of responders for the primary efficacy endpoint were:
•4.2% in the placebo group, 95% CI (0.0, 9.8);
•82.8% in the BOTOX group, 95% CI (78.1, 87.5); and
•87.2% in the Jeuveau® group, 95% CI (83.0, 91.5).
A confidence interval, or CI, is a range of values in which, statistically, there is a specified level of confidence where the result lies. As an example, in the results above for this Phase III study, the results indicate that there is a 95% level of confidence that the responder rate for placebo was between 0.0% and 9.8%, which we express as: 95% CI (0.0, 9.8). 
The absolute differences between the treatment groups were:
•83.1% between Jeuveau® and placebo groups, 95% CI (70.3, 89.4), (p<0.001), indicating Jeuveau® was superior to placebo; and
•4.4% between Jeuveau® and BOTOX groups, 95% CI (-1.9, 10.8), with non‑inferiority of Jeuveau® versus BOTOX concluded based on the lower bound of the 95% CI for the absolute difference exceeding -10.0%.

TRANSPARENCY Safety Evaluations
Safety was studied across all five studies that made up the TRANSPARENCY Clinical Program. Jeuveau® was relatively well tolerated with no drug related serious adverse events, or SAEs. Most adverse events were mild and the labeling information for Jeuveau® lists the most common adverse reactions as headache (9.3%), eyelid ptosis (2.0%), upper respiratory tract infections (3%) and increase white blood cell count (1%).
Pipeline
Phase II “Extra-Strength” Clinical Trial
In November 2021, we announced the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial designed to investigate a higher strength dose of Jeuveau® in the glabellar lines. This planned glabellar line study is a controlled, randomized, prospective, double blind, three-arm trial following patients out to a maximum of 12 months. Three-arms will be enrolled: the currently approved 20 units of BOTOX and 20 units of Jeuveau® compared to 40 units of “extra-strength” Jeuveau®. 
In January 2023, we announced positive interim results from the Phase II clinical trial. The interim data analysis of the “extra-strength” formulation of Jeuveau® demonstrated a median duration of at least 26 weeks based on the time for patients to return to their original glabellar line scale score (baseline) and the duration of at least one point improvement on the same scale. The safety results included 33 adverse events, 88% of which rated as mild and 12% of which rated at moderate. There were no severe or serious adverse events observed in the safety results. The trial is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023, and final results will be presented in the second half of 2023. 
Manufacturing
Daewoong Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., or Daewoong, manufactures and supplies Jeuveau® to us. Daewoong has over 70 years of experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products and is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in South Korea. Daewoong constructed a facility in South Korea where Jeuveau® is produced. We believe this facility will be sufficient to meet demand for Jeuveau® for the foreseeable future. The FDA conducted a current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, and pre-approval inspection of the facility in November 2017 in connection with our BLA for Jeuveau®. The UK Medicines 
and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, also completed an inspection of the manufacturing facility in February 2018 in connection with our Marketing Authorisation Application, or MAA. The U.S. FDA approval of Jeuveau® in February 2019 included approval to manufacture Jeuveau® at Daewoong’s facility.
Daewoong License and Supply Agreement
In 2013, we entered into the Daewoong Agreement, which has been amended from time to time, pursuant to which Daewoong agreed to manufacture and supply Jeuveau® and grant us an exclusive license to import, distribute, promote, market, develop, offer for sale and otherwise commercialize and exploit Jeuveau® for aesthetic indications in the United States, EU, United Kingdom, members of the European Economic Area, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, certain members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, and South Africa, as well as co-exclusive distribution rights with Daewoong in Japan. Under the Daewoong Agreement, we are required to make certain minimum annual purchases in order to maintain the exclusivity of the license. If we fail to meet these purchase requirements, Daewoong may, at its option, convert the exclusive license for such covered territory to a non-exclusive license. These minimum purchase obligations are contingent upon the occurrence of future events, including receipt of governmental approvals and our future market share in various jurisdictions. Under the Daewoong Agreement, Daewoong is responsible for all costs related to the manufacturing of Jeuveau®, including costs related to the operation and upkeep of its manufacturing facility, and we are responsible for all costs related to obtaining regulatory approval, including clinical expenses, and commercialization of Jeuveau®.
The initial term of the Daewoong Agreement expires September 30, 2023, and automatically renews for unlimited additional three-year terms if we meet certain performance requirements. We expect to meet these performance requirements. The Daewoong Agreement will terminate (A) upon written notice by either us or Daewoong upon a continuing default that remains uncured within 90 days (or 30 days for a payment default) by the other party, or (B) without notice upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of our company.
Under the Daewoong Agreement, we are the sole owner of any marketing authorization and clinical trial results we pursue in a covered territory. However, if we do not renew the Daewoong Agreement or upon termination of the Daewoong Agreement due to a breach by us, we are obligated to transfer our rights to Daewoong.
Impact of Settlement Agreements
In February 2021, we settled litigation claims related to a complaint against us filed by Allergan, Inc. and Allergan Limited (together, “Allergan”) and Medytox, Inc. (“Medytox”) in the U.S. International Trade Commission related to Jeuveau® (the “ITC Action”) and certain related matters by entering into a Settlement and License Agreement with Medytox and Allergan, which we refer to as the U.S. Settlement Agreement, and another Settlement and License Agreement with Medytox, which we refer to as the Medytox Settlement Agreement. We refer to the U.S. Settlement Agreement and the Medytox Settlement Agreement collectively as the Medytox/Allergan Settlement Agreements.
We have completed all obligations to Allergan and the majority of our obligations to Medytox under the Medytox/Allergan Settlement Agreements. These completed obligations consisted of (i) cash payments of $35.0 million in multiple payments to Allergan and Medytox, of which we paid $15.0 million in the third quarter of 2021, $15.0 million in the first quarter of 2022, and $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2023, (ii) royalty payments to Allergan and Medytox on the sale of Jeuveau®, based on a certain dollar amount per vial sold of Licensed Products by or on our behalf in the United States, from December 16, 2020 through September 16, 2022, (iii) royalty payments to Medytox, from December 16, 2020 to September 16, 2022, of a low-double digit percentage of net sales of Jeuveau® sold by us or on our behalf in territories we have licensed outside the United States, and (iv) the issuance of 6,762,652 shares of our common stock to Medytox.
Going forward, our remaining obligation will be to pay Medytox a mid-single digit royalty percentage on net sales of Jeuveau® in the United States and all territories we have licensed outside the United States through September 16, 2032. 
Competition
Our primary competitors are companies offering injectable dose forms of botulinum toxin. There are only five approved injectable botulinum toxin type A neurotoxins in the United States, including Jeuveau®. There are also other injectable botulinum toxin type A products being developed for the U.S. market. We believe the primary competing products in this market include BOTOX, Dysport, Xeomin and Daxxify:
•BOTOX, marketed by Allergan, received FDA approval in 2002 for glabellar lines. Allergan (now AbbVie) was the first company to market neurotoxins for aesthetic purposes.
•Dysport, marketed by Galderma S.A., or Galderma, received FDA approval in 2009 for glabellar lines.
•Xeomin, marketed by Merz Pharma GmbH & Co., or Merz, received FDA approval in 2011 for glabellar lines.
•Daxxify, marketed by Revance Therapeutics, Inc., or Revance, received FDA approval in late 2022 for glabellar lines.
Additionally, Hugel Inc., has submitted a BLA to the FDA for an injectable botulinum toxin type A neurotoxin. If the Hugel BLA is approved, we expect the competition in the U.S. injectable botulinum toxin market to further increase. Most of our primary competitors are also approved to sell injectable botulinum toxin type A neurotoxins in Europe and other markets that we may enter.
In addition to the companies commercializing and developing neurotoxins, there are other products and treatments that may indirectly compete with Jeuveau®, such as dermal fillers, laser treatments, brow lifts, chemical peels, fat injections and removal and cold therapy. We compete with various companies that have products in these medical aesthetic categories. Among these companies are Allergan (now AbbVie), Sanofi, Revance, Sun Pharma, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., or Valeant, Mentor Worldwide LLC, a division of Johnson & Johnson, Merz, Galderma, and Skinceuticals, a division of L’Oreal SA. In addition, we are aware of other companies also developing and/or marketing products in one or more of our target markets, including competing injectable botulinum toxin type A formulations that are in various phases of development in North America for the treatment of glabellar lines. 
Seasonality
Historically, given the limited history of the commercialization of Jeuveau®, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the impact of the ITC remedial orders, we have not observed significant seasonality in our net revenues up to the second half of 2022. However, we are aware that historically the aesthetic neurotoxin market generally experiences higher revenue in the second and fourth calendar quarters as compared to the first and third calendar quarters. 
Government Regulation in the United States
We operate in a highly regulated industry that is subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Our business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws including the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHS Act, among others. Biologics and medical devices are subject to regulation under the FFDCA and PHS Act.
In the United States, cosmetics, dietary supplements, biopharmaceutical products and medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FFDCA, PHS Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, regulatory approval, license or clearance, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of these products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending license or marketing applications, warning letters and other enforcement actions, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
FDA Marketing Approval
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an investigative new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use, according to the FDA’s regulations, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements including those for the protection of human research subjects and their health and other personal information;
•submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety;
•purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
•potential FDA audits of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once a BLA is approved, a product is subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as product manufacturing, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with applicable regulations such as cGMP and the Quality System Regulation. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Other Regulation of the Healthcare Industry
While we do not currently have plans for our neurotoxin product to be covered by insurance or government reimbursement programs, if we were to offer reimbursable products, we could be subject to federal laws and regulations covering reimbursable products, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law and Physician Payment Sunshine Act. These laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:
•The Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program;
•The Federal False Claims Act which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government;
•The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;
•The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits certain payments made to foreign government officials;
•The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making 
any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; 
•The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which require that certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report to the CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians, which is defined broadly to include other healthcare providers, teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
•State and foreign law equivalents of the foregoing and state laws regarding pharmaceutical company marketing compliance, reporting and disclosure obligations.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Government Regulation in Europe
In the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is composed of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA.
There are two types of MAs:
•The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
•National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. 
Because we are a biotechnology medicinal products company, we are eligible for a Community MA under the Centralized Procedure.
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Regulation Outside of the United States and Europe
In addition to regulations in the United States and EU, we may be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing manufacturing, clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval or MA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval or MA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
We are also subject to data privacy and security regulation by the federal government, states and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” those independent contractors or agents of covered entities that 
create, receive, maintain, transmit or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state and non-U.S. laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation adopted by the EU, govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. We also remain subject to federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to alleged privacy and data security violations. Further, certain states have proposed or enacted legislation that will create new data privacy and security obligations for certain entities, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which came into effect January 1, 2020 and was recently amended and expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CRPA, passed on November 3, 2020. The CCPA and CPRA, among other things, create new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also created a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to the CPRA by the California legislature or how it will be interpreted. Therefore, the effects of the CCPA and CPRA are significant and will likely require us to modify our data processing practices and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply, particularly given our base of operations in California.
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, fire hazard control, product stewardship and end-of-life handling or disposition of products, and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and biological materials. We believe that we have been and remain in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that we currently have no liabilities under such environmental requirements that could reasonably be expected to materially harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 215 employees, all of whom were full-time in the United States and United Kingdom, and 70% of our full-time employees were women. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we have never experienced any work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
Attracting and Developing Talent
We believe that our employees are our greatest asset, and our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain high caliber talent. Talent management is critical to our ability to execute our long-term growth strategy. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make our company a rewarding workplace. We provide opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, through professional development, leadership coaching, formal and informal training opportunities, and an annual performance review process to encourage ongoing growth and development. These opportunities are supported by strong total rewards packages, and by programs that build connections among our employees. 
Compensation and Benefits
We are committed to a Total Rewards strategy that complements our mission, culture, and business objectives. Our goal is to provide competitive compensation and benefit programs that drive a high level of employee satisfaction and allow us to attract and retain the best and brightest talent. We want employees to feel at their best and be at their best so they can make a profound impact on our culture, community and business results. Compensation and benefits are two of the main pillars of our total rewards package. We provide total cash compensation (base pay and bonus/commission) that is highly competitive in the labor markets in which we compete for talent. We also ensure that pay is internally equitable by differentiating rewards based on employee performance and impact to the company. This empowers employees to take ownership over their career 
and development trajectory. Long-term incentives in the form of equity (Stock Options and RSUs) provide a sense of ownership in the company’s long-term success and help retain talent that can make a difference. We also provide a robust and highly competitive benefits package to ensure employees’ personal and family needs are met whether it’s health (medical/dental/vision), wealth and retirement (401k with competitive employer match), or well-being (flexible PTO, paid leave, wellness coaching). We want employees to know that we are investing in their success so they can bring the best version of themselves each day.
Health, Safety and Wellness
We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees with access to a variety of health and wellness programs, including programs that support physical and mental health and well-being by providing tools, resources, and coaching to help them improve or maintain a healthy lifestyle. We maintain a healthy workplace by encouraging employees to work remotely if feeling ill, and by maintaining many of the changes implemented in response to COVID-19 including our hybrid work schedule, access to tests and sanitary supplies.
Inclusion and Belonging
We promote an inclusive culture that values equity, opportunity, and respect. In 2019, we formed an employee-led Culture & Belonging Council. This council has a vision to create and foster a culture that reflects diversity and inclusion so that each of our employees has a sense of belonging as their authentic, unique selves. In support of our inclusive culture, we provide a variety of diversity, equity, and inclusion trainings, including unconscious bias training for employees and managers to strengthen employee awareness and strive to recruit a diverse talent pool across all levels of the organization. We are an equal opportunity employer and believe that diverse and differentiated views contribute to making us a better organization. It is our conscious effort to support and promote equal opportunity for all our employees within the workplace.
Our company has been built on the belief and commitment of evolving together. This applies not only to our employees and customers, but also to the communities in which we operate. We offer paid volunteer time off to our employees and encourage our team of employees to become involved in their communities, lending their voluntary support to programs that positively impact the quality of life within these communities. We value the impact of ongoing volunteer opportunities with community partners Orangewood Foundation, Samueli Academy and the Jesse Rees Foundation.
