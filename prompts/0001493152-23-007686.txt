Item 1. Business
 
We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company leveraging our proprietary technology to develop novel therapies designed to cure cancers. Our goal is to extend the benefits of cancer treatments with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the most effective modalities for treating cancers. We are developing a pipeline of products designed to address limitations of the current cancer therapies as well as to extend to the new applications of radiation therapy. We believe that our product candidates will enable us to deliver cancer treatments that are safer, more reliable and at a greater scale than that of the current standard of care.
 
Our product candidates include Ropidoxuridine, Extended Bio-availability Ropidoxuridine (IPdR/TPI), and a platform of HDAC inhibitors (SP-1-161, SP-2-225 and SP-1-303). We have advanced Ropidoxuridine through a Phase I clinical trial using non-dilutive National Institutes of Health (NIH) The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts and are currently preparing a Phase II study that we intend to commence in 2023. We also plan to perform the IND-enabling studies in 2023 in order to submit an investigational new drug application (IND) for the selective HDAC6 inhibitor (SP-2-225) with the goal of initiating a Phase I clinical trial in 2024. We have applied for and received FDA approval of Orphan designation for Ropidoxuridine and RT for treating brain cancer (glioblastoma). We believe our management team’s expertise in radiation therapy, combined modality cancer treatment and immuno-oncology will help drive the development and, if approved, the commercialization of these potentially curative therapies for patients with aggressive cancers.
 
Radiation Oncology has gone through transformative technological innovation over the last several years to better define tumors, allow improved shaping of radiation delivery and support dose escalation with shorter courses of treatment. Furthermore, achieving higher dose distributions within tumor volumes has reached a practical plateau, since cancers are frequently integrated with or surrounded by more sensitive normal tissues and further dose increases risk of tissue necrosis. To increase cancer cures at maximally tolerated radiation doses, pharmacological and biological modifications of cells are needed to sensitize cancers, protect normal tissues, and stimulate the immune system to react against antigens produced by irradiated, damaged cancer cells. Drugs that show sensitizing properties, or the ability to make cancer cells more sensitive to radiation, offer a solution to this problem. Currently, such drugs are used off-label, and many have inherent toxicities since they were designed for direct cancer treatments and not for sensitization.
 
We are developing our products with the goal of addressing the unmet need in cancer treatment for a commercially marketable radiation response modifier solution that leads to greater sensitivity of cancer cells to ionizing radiation therapy. The goal of our products is to increase the therapeutic index for patients receiving radiation and to decrease radiation-related toxicities in patients with solid tumors. Our products operate across three areas related to the treatment of cancer with RT:
 

1. | Sensitization of growing cancer cells, rendering them more susceptible to the effects of radiation therapy. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Activation of the DNA damage response pathway to kill cancer cells and protect adjacent normal cells. 
3. | Activation of the immune system to kill any remaining cells after RT. 

 
Our platform technology allows for the creation of an inventory of products for radiation sensitizing, immune modulation, and protection of healthy tissue.

Our Pipeline
 
We are currently developing a pipeline of small molecule radiation sensitizers and immune response regulating drugs. Our most advanced product candidate is Ropidoxuridine, an orally available halogenated pyrimidine with strong cancer radiation sensitizing properties in preclinical studies. In addition to our clinical study-ready candidate, we have a pipeline of complimentary product candidates that we are developing to address a host of solid tumor cancer indications. Our pipeline is represented in the diagram below:
 

Timeline for clinical phase (Ropidoxuridine) and pre-clinical phase (HDAC inhibitors) pipeline.
 
Our lead product candidates include:
 

● | Ropidoxuridine (IPdR) is our lead candidate radiation sensitizer for use in combination with RT to treat brain tumors (glioblastoma) and sarcomas. Phase I clinical trial results supported by Shuttle Pharma and the NCI (CTEP) were reported in the medical journal, Clinical Cancer Research, in July 2019, by our SBIR subcontractor. Eighteen patients completed dose escalations to 1,800 mg/day for 30 days, establishing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 1,200 mg/day in combination with RT. Four partial responses, nine stable disease and one progressive disease in target lesions were reported. Four patients did not have measurable disease and, as a result, were not evaluable. These Phase I trial results demonstrate oral bioavailability and an MTD of 1,200 mg per day for 28 days for use in combination with radiation for Phase II clinical trials that we propose to perform in brain tumors and in sarcomas. The brain tumor, glioblastoma multiforme (GB) is eligible for orphan disease designations. Shuttle Pharma has advanced drug manufacture and formulation and prepared a draft clinical protocol of a “Phase 2 Single-Arm Study of IPdR as a Radiation Sensitizing Agent During Radiotherapy in Patients with Newly Diagnosed IDH-Wildtype MGMT Unmethlyated and Glioblastoma Multiforme.” We anticipate submitting an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for FDA review in the second quarter of 2023.

● | Ropidoxuridine and Tipracil (IPdR/TPI) is a new combination formulation demonstrating extended bioavailability after oral administration in an animal model system. The IPdR/TPI formulation will be developed for use as a radiation sensitizer of rectal cancers after the Phase II brain tumor clinical trial has been initiated. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | SP-1-161 is Shuttle Pharma’s pre-clinical candidate lead HDAC inhibitor, radiation sensitizing candidate product. This pan HDAC inhibitor initiates the mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM) response pathway. Using rational drug design, we discovered HDAC inhibitors and ATM activators capable of radiation sensitizing cancer cells and protecting normal cells. The candidate drug may serve as direct chemotherapeutic agents or as radiation sensitizers for treating cancers. 
● | SP-2-225 is Shuttle Pharma’s pre-clinical class IIb selective HDAC inhibitor that affects histone deacetylase HDAC6. SP-2-225 has effects on the regulation of the immune system. The interactions of RT with the immune response to cancers are of great current interest, offering insight into potential mechanisms for primary site and metastatic cancer treatment. For this reason, Shuttle Pharma has selected SP-2-225 as the candidate lead HDAC inhibitor for preclinical development. We are advancing drug manufacture and IND-enabling studies to enable a Phase I clinical trial in 2024. With the introduction of check-point inhibitors, CAR-T therapies and personalized medicine in cancer, regulation of the immune response following RT is of significant clinical and commercial interest. 
● | SP-1-303 is Shuttle Pharma’s pre-clinical selective Class I HDAC inhibitor that preferentially affects histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC3 and is a member of the class I HDAC family. SP-1-303 data show direct cellular toxicity in ER positive breast cancer cells. Furthermore, SP-1-303 increases PD-L1 expression.

Our Approach
 
We believe that we have established a leadership position in radiation sensitizer discovery and development. Over approximately six years of research, we have identified two clinical phase product candidates and discovered new pre-clinical molecules using our proprietary platform technologies to increase the therapeutic index for patients receiving radiation for treatment of solid tumors. Our development strategy has four key pillars: (1) to improve the efficacy of RT by demonstrating improved disease-free survival rates in patients who undergo radiation therapy, (2) reduce the amount of radiation needed for a favorable tumor response, thereby limiting the potential for radiation related toxicities to healthy cells, (3) decrease the extent of surgery needed to remove cancers and improve quality of life, and (4) leverage our next generation technologies to create drugs that regulate the immune response assisting immune checkpoint and CAR-T therapies and other personalized medicines targeting cancers.
 
We propose to perform Phase I and Phase II clinical trials to advance our clinical product candidates. In addition, candidate HDAC inhibitor molecules will be tested, and IND-enabling studies will be performed to prepare for Phase I clinical trials.
 
To date, we have been awarded three SBIR contracts from the NIH to:
 

● | Develop IPdR as a radiation sensitizer for the treatment of gastro-intestinal cancers, in combination with radiation therapy. This funding provided partial support for the Phase I clinical trial of Ropidoxuridine and RT. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Develop prostate cancer cell cultures from African-American men, with donor matched normal prostate cells, with the goal of establishing 50 pairs for accelerating research to reduce prostate cancer health disparities in African-American men. This project was funded under “Moonshot” designation and Shuttle Pharma is eligible to submit an application for additional SBIR (Phase IIb) funding to establish the infrastructure required to expand and distribute cells for research purposes. Cells from African-American patients are distributed to investigators who are conducting health disparities research. 
● | Develop predictive biomarkers for determining outcomes for prostate cancer patients following treatment with SBRT. This SBIR-funded project was completed on March 15, 2022 and Shuttle Pharma is eligible to apply for additional funding through the SBIR (Phase IIb) mechanism to de-risk clinical validation to develop the predictive biomarkers. 

 
All three SBIR funded projects have been completed. The Company is eligible to apply for SBIR Phase IIb funding to “bridge” the funding gap should Shuttle Pharma elect to advance the “Moonshot” health disparities or the predictive biomarker project. The NIH SBIR program is designed to encourage small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (“R/R&D”) that has the potential for commercialization.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to maintain and build upon our leadership position in radiation sensitization. We plan to develop Ropidoxuridine and the HDAC6 inhibitor (SP-2-225) and, if approved by the FDA, commercialize our product candidates for the treatment of cancers. While this process may require years to complete, we believe achieving this goal could result in new radiation sensitizer and immunotherapy products. Key elements of our strategy include:

● | Capitalize on Ropidoxuridine as an orally available, small molecule radiation sensitizer. To date, there is one drug (Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody) approved by the FDA specifically as a radiation sensitizer. If we are successful in developing Ropidoxuridine and obtaining FDA approval, a small molecule sensitizer would then be enabled for clinical applications for radiation sensitization. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expand our leadership position within radiation sensitizers. In addition to our traditional radiation sensitizers, we plan to advance our near-term pipeline to include radiation sensitizers for proton therapy. Proton Therapy is growing worldwide as a form of radiation therapy due to its unique beam shaping characteristics. As a result, this new technology offers a major opportunity for Shuttle Pharma to strive to develop an innovative and well-tolerated drug for proton therapy sensitization. 
● | Execute a disciplined business development strategy to strengthen our portfolio of product candidates. We have built our current product pipeline through in-house development, partnerships with leading academic institutions and through in-licensing. We will continue to evaluate new in-licensing opportunities and collaboration agreements with leading academic institutions and other biotechnology companies around programs that seek to address areas of high unmet need and for which we believe there is a high probability of clinical success, including programs beyond our target franchise areas and current technology footprint. 


● | Invest in our HDAC platform technology and maximize its utility across cancer therapies. We are initially applying the platform to develop drugs for cancer radiation sensitization, normal tissue radiation protection and post radiation immune stimulation. Based on the data we have obtained thus far, these drugs are immune regulatory. We intend to invest to develop other properties of our platform technology, as well. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enter into collaborations to realize the full potential of our platform. The breadth of our HDAC technology platform enables other therapeutic applications, including radiation sensitization and immune therapy. We intend to seek collaborations centered on our platform to maximize applications for cancer treatment.

Radiation Therapy
 
Radiation Oncologists use Radiation Therapy (RT) to treat cancers that cannot be completely removed by surgery but have not yet spread to distant sites within the body. RT has been a mainstay for the treatment of cancer malignancies for more than half a century. The combination treatment of radiation therapy and chemotherapy has involved the use of cytotoxic drugs, targeted biologic agents and targeted external beam radiation to increase the destruction of tumor cells and cure or delay cancer progression. The low number of drugs and biologic agents under investigation as radiation sensitizing agents highlights an unmet need for new approaches and agents that provide greater effectiveness, increased quality and better tolerability for patients.
 
Currently, “chemo-radiation” treatments are established in cancers of the head and neck, esophagus, lung, stomach, breast, brain, pancreas, rectum and uterine cervix. The ideal radiation sensitizer would reach the tumor in adequate concentrations and act selectively in the tumor, as compared to surrounding normal tissues. It would have predictable pharmacokinetics for timing with radiation therapy and could be administered with every radiation treatment approach. The ideal radiation sensitizer would have minimal toxicity or manageable enhancement of radiation toxicity.
 
The U.S. market for radiation sensitizing agents is experiencing dynamic growth through development of new radiation technology, the introduction of new agents, growth in the number of diagnosed patients in a variety of cancers and changes in treatment patterns. New agents have been introduced, including bevacizumab (Avastin®, Roche), panitumumab (Vectibix®, Amgen), temozolomide (Temodar®, Merck) and cetuximab (Erbitux®, Eli Lilly/Imclone), with potential as radiation sensitizing agents (though all but cetuximab are used off label); and all are recommended by the NCCN® (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) in clinical practice guidelines for use in combination with established therapies such as FOLFOX (leucovorin, 5-FU, oxaliplatin), CapeOX (capecitabine, oxaliplatin) and FOLFIRI (leucovorin, 5-FU, irinotecan).
 
The growth in the number of patients with cancers is being driven by an aging population and improved diagnostic tools. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), more than half (~50 - 60%) of all cancer patients undergo some type of radiotherapy during the course of their treatment. Confirming the patient estimate from the NCI, the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) factsheet states approximately 67% of approximately 1.25 million cancer patients are treated with radiation therapy annually, either one or more times during the course of treatment. In addition, in a study published by the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2016, it is estimated that the number of cancer patients needing radiation therapy will increase by 22% in the next 10 years. (See “The Future of Radiation Oncology in the United States From 2010 to 2020: Will Supply Keep Pace With Demand?” Benjamin D. Smith, Bruce G. Haffty, Lynn D. Wilson, Grace L. Smith, Akshar N. Patel, and Thomas A. Buchholz Journal of Clinical Oncology 2010 28:35, 5160-5165).
 
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) estimates more than 80% of cancers in the U.S. occur in people in the age group of 50 and above with over 60% of cancers occurring in those 65 and over. (See, 2018 Clinical Cancer Advances Report, American College of Clinical Oncology, 2018). For example, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS), more than 90% of colorectal cancer patients are individuals aged 50 years and older, with approximately 40% of all cases occur in patients aged 75 years and over. The Colon Cancer Alliance estimates that 90% of new cases and 95% of deaths from colorectal cancers occur in people aged 50 or older. Also, the U.S. Census estimates that the age group of 65-84 will grow by 23% within the next five years, indicating a likely increase in the overall number of cancer patients in the U.S.

The U.S. 2019 estimated incidence, deaths and five-year survival rate of cancer patients responsive to radiation therapy is significant (ACS Facts & Figures, 2019). The top cancers responsive to radiation are shown, based on the number of newly diagnosed patients. The incidence rates for some cancers are increasing by approximately 1-2% per year in the U.S. The number of newly diagnosed patients is significant and growing due to the aging of the population and improved diagnostic techniques.
 
All of the listed cancers illustrate the opportunity presented for radiation sensitizers. Of note is the low five-year survival of pancreas, brain, lung and esophagus cancers—all are candidates for Shuttle’s pipeline of radiation sensitizing compounds. Cancers with low survival rates are of interest since they show a high unmet need for new therapeutics and an opportunity for Shuttle to gain significant uptake of their pipeline compounds.
 
Factors that are challenges and may restrict growth in the radiation sensitizer market include the safety and tolerability of many of the newer agents with radiation sensitizing properties; a regulatory environment that engenders greater levels of scrutiny of clinical practice issues; the high cost of newer agents; and the changing (and more restrictive) reimbursement environment in radiation oncology through CMS (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services) and private payors. These factors may negatively impact the potential for growth in the U.S. market.
 
Many of the drugs used “off-label” as radiation sensitizers currently require close scrutiny of their potential for side effects that can affect the safety and tolerability of their use with patients. All of the current agents carry significant potential for side effects that can affect patients’ therapies and quality of life. Radiation sensitizing agents can cause both acute and chronic side effects in patients. Side effects can vary from person to person depending on age, sex, type of cancer, dose given per day, total dose given, and the patient’s general medical condition. Some common side effects of currently used radiation sensitizers include leukopenia, skin damage, hair loss, fatigue, bladder problems, nausea, fibrosis, memory loss, infertility, and enhanced risk of developing a second cancer, which may arise as a result of the patient’s weakened immune system due to cytotoxic drugs used in treatment or when newer biologic agents cause the over-production of specific cytokines or proteins, which can lead to developing secondary cancers.
 
Over the past five years, the FDA has taken an increasingly conservative approach to the approval of new agents for oncology treatment. There is greater scrutiny of results from clinical trials regarding progression free survival, overall survival, and safety and tolerability of new agents. Restrictions such as black box warnings and REMS (Risk Evaluation and Migration Strategies) are being applied to more new products over the past five years compared to the previous five years. These restrictions require physicians to be more careful in evaluating the use of newer agents and newer diagnostic tools to select the most appropriate patients for newer approved agents.
 
Many of the new agents are molecularly targeted therapies that are biologic in their development and manufacturing. The cost of the newer agents can be significant. For example, the cost for Avastin for one treatment course as a radiation sensitizer is estimated at $9,000-12,000 according to one Key Opinion Leader in the U.S. (Carl Schmidt, Consultant, Shuttle Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc., Business Plan 2018). Recently, a CAR-T gene therapy from Novartis was launched with a yearly cost of $475,000. Further, as many private payors scrutinize the cost and appropriate use of newer drugs, they require physicians to provide justification for use of newer agents through prior authorization requests, use of step therapy and to follow guidelines that delay treatment, increase administrative costs and limit the therapeutic choices for physicians and hospitals.
 
Public payors for radiation oncology therapies such as CMS have instituted reimbursement reductions that potentially affect the overall cost of therapy and can limit the acceptance of newer agents. With CMS announced reductions in reimbursement for radiation oncology, there is increased pressure to find a more potent radiation sensitizer agent with reduced side effects, and greater cost-effectiveness.
 
Escalating healthcare spending is adding pressure on government and commercial payors to contain drug costs. While the oncology space is arguably not as tightly managed by payors as other therapeutic areas, utilization management of costly cancer therapeutics has become an increasing priority for U.S. payors, especially with the advent of biologics. Payors (and market access agencies in the EU) will most often restrict high-cost drugs, drugs with limited or no survival benefits, and drugs deemed to be at high risk for widespread off-label use.
 
Beyond efforts at cost containment by insurers (which often require patients to first be prescribed lower cost drugs in order to determine effectiveness prior to allowing for reimbursements for more expensive (or less cost effective) drugs), payors are also looking toward implementing clinical pathways as a way to maintain or improve health outcomes while lowering costs. Clinical pathways are designed to address the limitations of prior authorization and of reduced fee schedules, offering more durable cost containment to payors. These pathways may lead to cost savings by encouraging the use of generics, streamlining treatment choices, and reducing side effects while maintaining outcomes.

Engineered Radiation Sensitizers
 
The market for radiation sensitizers in selected cancer types is defined by the need to improve local-regional tumor control. Treatment regimens have been developed to address patient needs for tumor control and quality of life. Since the initial applications of Ropidoxuridine and selective HDAC inhibitors are as adjuncts to the standard of care for the treatment of radiation responsive cancers, the unmet needs of the market lie in the potential for the following:

● | Improvement in efficacy of radiation treatments as determined by overall survival, progression free survival and response rates in comparison to currently used “off-label” sensitizer drugs. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reduction in radiation doses needed to affect a positive clinical response for the patient. 
● | Reduction in the surgical extent that is needed to remove residual cancer. 
● | Improvement in quality-of-life outcomes. 

 
Various sources have estimated that more than 800,000 patients in the U.S. are treated with radiation therapy for their cancers. According to the American Cancer Society, about 50% are treated for curative purposes and the balance for palliative care. The market opportunity for radiation sensitizers lies with the 400,000 patients treated for curative purposes. The number of patients being treated with RT is expected to grow by more than 22% over the next five years. Based on a rough estimate of a course of radiation sensitizing brand drug therapy (off label at this time) of $12,000 per patient—the market size would be in excess of $4.0 billion. This would represent about 4% of the annual cost of cancer care in the U.S.
 
In the past two decades, developments in the field of oncology have resulted in an increase in the number of clinical trials of marketed products that exhibit radiation sensitizing properties. The following are a few examples of recently approved products that exhibit radiation sensitizing properties: topotecan (Hycamtin®) was approved for ovarian and small-cell lung cancer and also in cervical cancer when used in combination with cisplatin. Irinotecan (Camptosar®) is used for metastatic colorectal carcinoma, trastuzumab (Hercepetin®) for breast cancer, and gefitinib (Iressa®) for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. However, the claims on radiation sensitization are anecdotal in the scientific literature.
 
In addition, clinical trials are in progress to develop novel molecules (such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (such Zolinza® (vorinostat) and heat-shock protein 90 (hsp90) inhibitors with potential to increase the therapeutic use of compounds with radiation sensitizing properties for other cancers. Several drugs with radiation sensitizing properties are currently in Phase III clinical trials, such as nimorazole (for head and neck cancer), motexafin gadolinium (for brain metastases), and cisplatin (for cervical cancer); though none are likely to apply for a radiosensitizing claim with the FDA since the radiosensitizing element in their clinical trials are not primary endpoints. While additional drugs with radiation sensitizing properties are expected to be launched in the future, thereby driving the radiation sensitizers market further, to date, there is no indication that any drug in development is expected to be approved specifically as a radiation sensitizer. 
 
The competitive environment for “off-label” radiation sensitizers for solid tumor cancers is anticipated to become predominantly generic. Avastin, Erbitux, Camptosar and Xeloda have or will lose patent protection in the next three years. Newer products under investigation or approved, such as Vectibix® (panitumumab) from Amgen will be promoted as having radiation sensitizing properties, along with indications for treatment for specific cancers. The high cost of these new therapies coupled with limited efficacy compared to current standard of care will be constrained by both public and private payors. Other new agents are in development but will face similar challenges.
 
We anticipate that new products launching into the cancer market with anecdotal claims for use as radiation sensitizers with improved effectiveness, quality and tolerability will initially be limited in their growth until they have been added to established clinical pathways and guidelines. If their effectiveness, quality and tolerability are demonstrated clinically, as determined by the FDA, it is anticipated the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the leading authority in oncology drug evaluation for treatment guidelines, would issue a recommendation and addition to standard of care within approximately six to twelve months after launch. An NCCN recommendation would positively impact the growth potential for a new product entering the market. Also, payors, both public and private, would add the new product to their approved drug lists and provide reimbursement giving providers incentive to use the product as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy to standard of care.
 
As with many cancer therapies, side effects can often have a distinct impact on quality of life and influence the potential for market growth. Patients increasingly have a stronger voice in the decision-making process for the appropriate therapies and costs to treat their cancers. As payors are increasingly placing more of the financial burden of the cost of therapy directly on patients, patients are voicing their opinions to their physicians and payors which have a direct effect on which products are selected. Many of the current therapies have significant side effects:
 
Private insurers are expected to have more restrictive formularies and medical benefits in which patients will be expected to carry more of the burden of the cost of drugs. Also, it is anticipated that increased application of third party developed treatment guidelines, such as those from the NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network), are expected to be used by private payors to limit the access to products for specific conditions through prior authorizations and implementation of step therapy or increased out of pocket cost approaches. As many of the current drugs used as radiation sensitizers are expensive and not approved for use as radiation sensitizers (thus, such treatment is “off label”), and as many of the products in clinical trials are expected to be at the current or higher price levels, new products that may be specifically approved for an indication as the only approved product as a radiation sensitizer will have increased consideration for reimbursement.

CMS is increasingly moving many patients to private insurance through Medicare Advantage and ACOs. Medicare Advantage plans are capitation HMO and PPO plans offered through private insurers to Medicare patients. ACOs are being developed to increase quality of care for their patients. Most of the new ACOs are initially positioned for Medicare patients with over 400 approved by CMS. Several studies from the Center for Health Strategies, 2017, Journal of American Medical Association, 2018 and the Brookings Institute, 2015 estimated that almost 1000 ACOs for Medicare and non-Medicare patient populations would be approved by CMS or developed by a variety of healthcare entities to begin operating under the ACA in 2017. We expect the growth in ACOs to continue, regardless of any changes that may be made to the ACA going forward. In early 2017, Health Affairs, a magazine tracking ACOs, estimated that over 22 million patients are enrolled in Medicare and private ACOs. To address the quality of care measures designated by CMS and to gain additional incentives, use of clinical pathways or treatment guidelines is anticipated to be increasingly instituted to manage patient care. The impact on the uptake of new products in this environment can be profound if the new product is first in class and is included in national guidelines from organizations such as the NCCN and/or approval by the regional CMS contracting groups.
 
ROPIDOXURIDINE
 
The halogenated thymidine (TdR) analogs, bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) and iododeoxyuridine (IUdR), are a class of pyrimidine analogs that have been recognized as potent radiosensitizing agents since the early 1960s. (See Kinsella TJ. An Approach to the Radiosensitization of Human Tumors. Cancer J Sci Am. Jul-Aug 1996:2(4); 184-193). Their cellular uptake and metabolism are dependent on the TdR salvage pathway where they are initially phosphorylated to the monophosphate derivative by the rate-limiting enzyme, thymidine kinase (TK). (See Shewach DS, Lawrence TS. Antimetabolite radiosensitizers. J Clin Oncol, Sep 10 2007; 25(26):4043-4050). After sequential phosphorylation to triphosphates, they are then used in DNA replication, in competition with deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP), by DNA polymerase. DNA incorporation is a prerequisite for radiosensitization of human tumors by the halogenated TdR analogs, and the extent of radiosensitization correlates directly with the percentage TdR replacement in DNA. (See Lawrence TS, Davis MA, Maybaum J, Stetson PL, Ensminger WD. The Dependence of Halogenated Pyrimidine Incorporation and Radiosensitization on the Duration of Drug Exposure. International Journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics. Jun 1990; 18(6);1393-1398). The molecular mechanisms of radiosensitization are most likely the result of increased susceptibility of TdR analog-substituted DNA to the generation of highly reactive uracil free radicals by ionizing radiation (IR), which may also damage unsubstituted complementary-strand DNA. Repair of IR damage may also be reduced by pre-IR exposure to these analogs.
 
The rationale for using Ropidoxuridine as a radiation sensitizer is based on prior clinical studies with the active metabolite IUdR; identified in NIH laboratories as a potent radiation sensitizer. Ropidoxuridine is an orally available prodrug of IUdR. In the body, Ropidoxuridine is metabolized in the liver into IUdR. IUdR is incorporated into the DNA of actively growing cells and when cells are exposed to ionizing radiation, DNA strand breaks are generated, resulting in more cell death and radiation sensitization. (See Gurkan E, Schupp JE, Aziz MA, Kinsella TJ, Loparo KA. Probabilistic modeling of DNA mismatch repair effects on cell cycle dynamics and iododeoxyuridine-DNA incorporation. Cancer Res. Nov 15 2007; 67(22):10993-11000).
 
Most of the clinical efficacy data were obtained from NIH supported studies performed with IUdR, the active metabolite of Ropidoxuridine. However, IUdR requires constant infusion over six weeks of therapy which creates a significant compliance issue for patients. Ropidoxuridine can be given as a capsule for oral administration, resulting in greater ease of medication delivery and potentially improved compliance and fewer complications.
 
Over the last 20 years, there has been renewed interest in these halogenated TdR analogs as experimental radiation sensitizers in selected cancer patient groups. These analogs are rapidly metabolized in both rodents and humans, principally with cleavage of deoxyribose and subsequent dehalogenation by hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism, when given as a bolus infusion with a plasma half-life of <5 min. Consequently, prolonged continuous or repeated intermittent drug infusions over several weeks before and during irradiation are necessary, based on in vivo human tumor kinetics, to maximize the proportion of tumor cells that incorporate these analogs into DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle. (See Fowler JF, Kinsella TJ. The Limiting Radiosensitization of Tumors by S-phase Sensitizers. Br J Cancer. 1996;74 (Suppl)(27):294-296). Phase I and Phase II trials using prolonged continuous or repeated intermittent intravenous infusions of BUdR or IUdR before and during radiation therapy (RT) have focused principally on patients with high-grade brain tumors. These clinically radiation resistant tumors can have a rapid proliferation rate (potential tumor doubling times of 5–15 days) and are surrounded by non-proliferating normal brain tissues that show little to no DNA incorporation of the TdR analogs. As such, high-grade brain tumors are ideal targets for this approach to radiation sensitization. In Phase I/Phase II clinical trials, prolonged survival outcomes were observed compared to RT alone in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas and in patients with glioblastoma multiforme IUdR continuous IV infusion (1000 mg/m2/ day/ 14 days), Total 39 patients (F. Sullivan, et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1994; 30(3):583-90.) A therapeutic gain in clinical radiation sensitization using these halogenated TdR analogs was proposed for other types of clinically poorly radiation responsive (radiation resistant) cancers, including locally advanced cervical cancer, head and neck cancers, unresectable hepatic metastases from colorectal cancers, and locally advanced sarcomas, based on the results of other Phase I/Phase II clinical trials.
 
Target Indication: Glioblastoma, Sarcomas and Rectal Cancers
 
After completion of the Phase I clinical trial of Ropidoxuridine and RT in advanced GI cancers, we proposed to perform Phase II efficacy clinical trials in brain tumors (glioblastoma), soft tissue sarcomas, and rectal cancers. Glioblastoma multiforme is a deadly malignancy of the brain with no known cure. Radiation therapy provides delay of disease progression and is standard of care following surgical resection or biopsy. Radiation therapy is combined with Temodar, a drug that has shown activity (~ four months survival benefit) in treating brain tumors. Preliminary data using radiation therapy in combination with IUdR resulted in a delay of disease progression of up to six months. We propose to test IPdR in combination with radiation therapy in the Phase II clinical trial. Similarly, delay in disease progression has been observed following treatment of sarcomas by the combination of IUdR and RT. Based on the Phase I data of our clinical trial we know that therapeutic levels of IUdR are reached by administering the orally available prodrug, IPdR.

Clinical Data
 
The Phase I results of the clinical trial supported by an SBIR contract to Shuttle Pharma and a sub-contract to the Brown University Oncology Group (BrUOG) at the LifeSpan/Rhode Island Hospital were reported by the subcontractor at the 30th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium in November 2018 and in the medical journal, Clinical Cancer Research, in 2019. Eighteen patients completed dose escalation to 1800 mg/day for 30 days, establishing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 1,200 mg/day in combination with RT. Therapeutic blood levels of IUdR were achieved. Four patients were scored as partial responses, nine patients had stable disease and one patient progressed in the target lesions. These data support advancing IPdR and RT to clinical trials for the FDA to determine efficacy.
Development Plan
 
A key to driving the Ropidoxuridine product forward, the new formulation of IPdR/TPI, is the development of a clinical plan with aggressive timelines and support within the radiation oncology community to participate in clinical trials with the appropriate patients to ensure a comprehensive NDA dossier for each product. Initially, the plan is focused on the Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. Upon completion of these studies, we will determine whether to extend the Phase II study to a randomized Phase II, or to perform a randomized Phase III clinical trial. Such determination will be based, in part, on results of the initial clinical trials and the end of a Phase II meeting with the FDA. Shuttle Pharmaceuticals requested and received FDA orphan drug status for Ropidoxuridine as a clinical radiation sensitizer for treatment of glioblastoma and pre-operative treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. As a result, the application for “orphan” designation for Ropidoxuridine with RT for glioblastoma has been approved. The application for sarcomas, however, was not approved and will require addressing certain FDA comments and resubmission. The IPdR/TPI formulation clinical plan will focus on resectable stage II and III rectal cancer patients.
 
Our clinical plan for Ropidoxuridine development includes:
 

● | GMP manufacture and formulation of 24 kg of Ropidoxuridine for use in clinical trials. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Completion of pre-clinical Ropidoxuridine and Temodar drug-drug interaction safety study. 
● | Submission of an IND for a Phase II clinical trial of Ropidoxuridine, Temodar and RT in glioblastoma. 
● | Negotiations for contract research organizations (CRO) contracts to perform the Phase II clinical trial. 
● | Completion of the Phase II clinical trial in glioblastomas to determine appropriate dosing, quality, effectiveness and tolerability. 

 
We believe the data obtained from the NIH/NCI SBIR funded Phase I clinical trial supports efforts to raise additional capital to enable performing the Phase II clinical trials of Ropidoxuridine. We aim to conduct and complete the Phase II clinical trial so that we may present data to the FDA for its determination of efficacy. We believe this will support our efforts to raise the additional required capital to fund Phase III clinical trials and seek FDA approval of an NDA with “orphan” designation.
 
The clinical plan for the IPdR/TPI formulation will focus on resectable Stage II and Stage III rectal cancer patients. Nonetheless, we cannot guarantee the successful completion of any of these trials. Our inability to meet any of the aforementioned milestones in the Phase II or Phase III clinical trials will cause us to be unable to proceed with our present efforts and will likely cause us to be unable to raise additional funds.
 
Our HDAC Small Molecule Delivery Platform
 
General
 
Since the founding of Shuttle Pharma, our discovery research and development efforts have been focused on our small molecule technology delivery platform which uses HDAC inhibitors, designed to target cancer cells, while protecting healthy tissue.
 
HDACs are a class of enzymes that regulate gene expression through chemical modification of histones and non-histone proteins. Increased HDAC activity leads to a more condensed chromatin (which is a protein complex consisting of DNA and other proteins), decreased gene expression and loss of key gene products, including tumor suppressor gene function. Inhibition of HDAC activity leads to a more open chromatin and increased expression of the key gene products. This chromatin modification underlies the epigenetic cellular regulatory system and is an area of intense investigation.

Our research and development efforts to date have focused on the discovery of novel, dual functional molecules for potential use in cancer treatment as radiation sensitizers of cancers, protectors of normal tissues, and activators of the immune responses to antigens expressed by irradiated cancer cells. To date, we have produced three candidate molecules: 
 

● | SP-1-161, a candidate lead of compounds demonstrating activation of the “ATM” gene product (mutated in Ataxia-Telangiectasia). Ataxia-Telangiectasia is a human genetic disease characterized by neurological, immunological and radiobiological clinical features. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | SP-2-225, a candidate lead of compounds demonstrating Class II (HDAC6) selective inhibition. HDAC6 is a molecule integral to the presentation of antigens by macrophages to T-lymphocytes. 
● | SP-1-303 is a candidate Class I HDAC inhibitor with preferential efficacy against ER positive cancers. 

SP-1-161 - A Dual Functional Agent
 
SP-1-161 is an HDAC inhibitor of the hydroxamate chemical class of compounds and an ATM activator of the indole chemical class. HDACs modify histones and non-histone proteins, which are key components of the chromatin structure, gene expression regulation, and cell growth. HDAC inhibitors inhibit cell proliferation, angiogenesis and immunity. Eighteen human HDACs have been identified, subdivided into four classes based on sequence and functional homology. In cancer cells, HDAC activity silences tumor suppressor genes important for cell growth regulation and to chromosomal instability. Abnormal HDAC activity is also associated with tumor cell growth, invasion, metastasis and resistance to therapy. Therefore, inhibitors of HDACs have emerged as anti-cancer agents for cancer therapy. Vorinostat and romidepsin have been approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphomas. In addition, panobinostat received FDA approval for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone.
 
In preclinical studies, SP-1-161 inhibited the activity of pan-HDACs and activated the ATM gene product. ATM is a critical protein for the activation of the cell stress response for cellular recovery from radiation exposure in normal cells, but not in cancer cells. ATM activates the P53 protein, referred to as the “guardian of the genome,” and serves as a tumor suppressor critical for normal cell function and activation of programmed cell death in cancer cells.
 
In preclinical studies, SP-1-161 protected normal breast epithelial cells (184A1) following exposure to ionizing radiation while increasing sensitivity of breast cancer cells (MCF7). SP-1-161 provides this dual function in a single molecule and this molecule is differentiated from other HDAC inhibitors by treatment of cancers while protecting normal cells.
 
SP-2-225
 
SP-2-225 is a selective HDAC inhibitor that affects histone deacetylase (HDAC6) and is a member of the class IIb HDAC family. Class II HDACs play important roles in cancer motility, invasion, neurological diseases, and immune checkpoint. HDAC6 inhibition has been most extensively studied for its role in the treatment of hematological cancers. HDAC6 is unique among HDAC enzymes in having two active catalytic domains and a unique physiological function. In addition to the modification of histones, HDAC6 targets specific substrates including α-tubulin and HSP90, and are involved in protein trafficking and degradation, cell shape and migration. Selective HDAC6 inhibitors are an emerging class of pharmaceuticals due to the involvement of HDAC6 in pathways related to neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and immunology. Specifically, its potential to affect regulation of the immune system and enhance the immune response in cancer is of great interest. With the introduction of check-point inhibitors, CAR-T therapies and personalized medicine in cancer, regulation of the immune response to this therapy is of significant clinical and commercial interest. (See Grindrod S, Brown M, Jung M. “Development of dual Function Small Molecules as Therapeutic Agents for Cancer Research,” Poster presentation #A178, American Association of Cancer Research Oct 2017).
 
Selective inhibition of HCAC6 reduces dose limiting side effects associated with non-selective HDAC inhibitors. Selective HDAC6 inhibitors may be combined with other cytotoxic agents. Shuttle’s discovery of selective HDAC inhibitors has yielded several HDAC6 selective candidate molecules including SP-2-225. HDAC6 inhibitors are under investigation for roles in the treatment of diseases such as multiple myeloma.
 
SP-1-303 - Target Indication: Breast Cancer
 
Histone deacetylase inhibitors sensitize cancers to the effects of radiation, protect normal tissues from radiation injury and activate the immune system. SP-1-303 is a selective Class I HDAC inhibitor that inhibits HDAC1, 3 and 6 and has direct cellular toxicity in ER positive breast cancer cells. Furthermore, SP-1-303 increases the PD-L1 expression level in a time-dependent manner, support combination of SP-1-303 with an immune checkpoint blocker to enhance the therapeutic benefits. We are currently conducting preclinical efficacy studies of these molecules.

Development Plan
 
The HDAC inhibitor platform of candidate molecules will require pre-clinical evaluation, completion of IND-enabling studies and the lead drug candidates will be tested in Phase I clinical trials for pharmacokinetics and MTD determination. We have three lead candidates for potential development for the treatment of solid tumors, including breast cancer, lung cancer and multiple myeloma.
 
The results of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials will determine further drug development and Shuttle will seek to establish collaborative partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies to complete pre-clinical and clinical development, drug manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates. In the event we are unsuccessful in completing our clinical trials at any stage, or in the event we obtain negative results, we will likely be unable to raise additional funding related to our HDAC studies or will have to change direction of our research efforts regarding the HDAC inhibitor platform of candidate molecules.
 
Our Manufacturing Strategy
 
We have no manufacturing facilities that are company owned or operated. We have performed laboratory scale synthesis and testing in our research laboratories in Gaithersburg, Maryland. GMP synthesis of API, drug formulation and human dosage preparation will be performed under contracts with third-party manufacturers.
Strategic Agreements
 
We have developed important strategic agreements with academic institutions for access to resources such as intellectual property, core facilities and contracting relationships. In addition, we have established an agreement with Propagenix for intellectual property in-licensing. Our current and ongoing relationships include:

Competition “Off-Label” Use
 

Drugs with radiation sensitizing properties.
 
Our Product Candidates
 
We are advancing a clinical stage product candidate, Ropidoxuridine, that we believe will target cancer cells while protecting healthy tissue when used in conjunction with RT.
Ropidoxuridine
 
Ropidoxuridine, an orally available halogenated pyrimidine with strong cancer radiation sensitizing properties, is our lead “clinical phase” product candidate. Halogenated pyrimidines are incorporated into DNA by rapidly growing cancer cells and become more sensitive to the effects of RT. We have received an SBIR contract from the NIH to fund a Phase I clinical trial in collaboration with Brown University at the Lifespan/Rhode Island Hospital to determine the maximum tolerated dose in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers. In connection with the trial, NCI has approved the Phase I clinical protocol and provided drug and clinical data management support to Rhode Island Hospital. The Phase I clinical trial has been completed and the results support advancing Ropidoxuridine to Phase II clinical trials of brain tumors, sarcomas and other tumors through CROs.
 
The following tables provide data from reported clinical trials of Iododeoxyuridine and RT therapy in brain cancers (glioblastoma multiforme) and high-grade sarcomas. Our primary strategy for Ropidoxuridine and RT therapy is to provide oral drug delivery to effect radiation sensitization of cancers and validate effectiveness in glioblastoma and sarcoma, potential “Orphan” indications.

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to our primary product candidate, we are developing and planning to develop other cancer radiation sensitizers and radiation protectors, which target protecting normal tissue during the administration of RT, and other products utilizing our HDAC small molecule technology platform.
 
SBIR Contracts
 
The SBIR Program
 
The Small Business Innovation Research program, as developed by Congress under the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982, is designed to encourage domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (“R/R&D”) that has the potential for commercialization. Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR enables small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. Some of the SBIR’s program goals include stimulating technological innovation, meeting Federal research and development needs and encouraging participation in innovation and entrepreneurship.
 
The SBIR program is a three-phase program. Phase 1 is to establish the technical merit and commercial potential of the proposed R/R&D efforts. Phase 2 is to continue the R/R&D efforts initiated in Phase 1 and funding is based on the results achieved in Phase 1. Phase 3 allows for the small business to pursue commercialization objectives resulting from the Phase 1 and 2 R/R&D activities. In addition, companies that have successfully completed Phases I and II are also eligible to apply for Phase IIb funding.
 
In addition to the SBIR contract to fund our Phase I clinical study on Ropidoxuridine in combination with RT for treatment of advanced gastrointestinal cancers, we have also received awards of SBIR contracts from the NIH to address prostate cancer health disparities and prostate cancer radiation biomarker development.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, all SBIR contracts received by the Company have been completed. The Company submitted a final report for SBIR contract # 75N81018C00031 on March 28, 2022. The following summary of terms for the three Phase II SBIR contracts is provided below.

Prostate Cancer Studies to Address Health Disparities
 
Prostate cancer health disparities studies have shown that African-American men are at higher risk for developing prostate cancer, as well as at higher risk of cancer specific death rates as compared to Caucasian American men. The causes of disparities have been attributed to socioeconomic differences, environmental exposures and biological factors. Most disparities studies have been population based, in part, due to the lack of relevant in vitro and in vivo models to support biological studies.
 
Shuttle Pharma has been awarded Phase I and II SBIR contracts entitled “Cell-based models for prostate cancer health disparity research” to develop African-American prostate cancer cell lines with donor matched normal prostate epithelial cell lines from African American men.
 
The commercialization of the prostate cells will require additional support through the SBIR funding mechanism. Companies that have completed Phase I and II SBIR awards are eligible to apply for Phase IIb SBIR funding. These awards are intended to de-risk a project by providing up to $4 million of matching funding for product development to commercialization. We intend to apply for such government funding to advance laboratory facilities and to expand the availability of the cell cultures. We did not raising capital through our IPO for the health disparities project. Should we not be successful for SBIR IIb funding, we will pause and may have to terminate this project.
 
Prostate Cancer Biomarker Development
 
Patients treated for prostate cancer may experience treatment related late effects that adversely affect quality of life and may prove life-threatening. Shuttle Pharma has been awarded a Phase I SBIR contract entitled “Predictive biomarkers for prostate cancer patient sensitivity for radiation late effects” to determine the technical and commercial feasibility of a biomarker panel predictive of radiation mediated late effects in patients treated for prostate cancer.
 
Through collaboration with Georgetown University, patients treated with SBRT for prostate cancers will be analyzed for urinary and rectal symptoms and their blood will be analyzed by mass spectroscopy for predictive biomarkers. The discovery and validation of metabolite panels to serve as a predictive biomarker of patient outcomes following radiation therapy will support future development and commercialization of a diagnostic product through a Phase 2 SBIR effort.
 
The development to commercialization of the metabolite predictive biomarker panel will require additional support through the SBIR funding mechanism. We will be eligible to apply for Phase IIb SBIR funding the next round of solicitation. A Phase IIb will help de-risk the project by providing up to $4 million of matching funds for performing the clinical validation trial for product development to commercialization. We intend to apply for such government funding to advance this project. We do not intend to use the funds raised through our IPO for the health disparities project. Should we not be successful for SBIR IIb funding, we will terminate this project.
 
Collaborative Arrangements
 
While we intend to enter into collaborative arrangements to further develop our drug candidates in the future, at present we have not entered into any collaborative arrangements with third parties to develop our drug candidates as we are still completing clinical trials and, as a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise.
Intellectual Property
 
We invest significant amounts in research and development. Our research and development expenses before contract reimbursements were $1,699,985 and $1,527,185 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively. After reimbursements for contracts of $211,455 and $505,377 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net research and development expenses were $1,488,530 and $1,021,808, respectively.


We are seeking multifaceted protection for our intellectual property that includes licenses, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators, subcontractors and other third parties and generally control access to our documentation and proprietary information.

U.S. Patent Application No. 17/851,8551 | Selective histone deacetylase inhibitors for the treatment of human disease | 6/28/2022 | | 

 
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP prepared patent applications related to Ropidoxuridine (IpdR) and HDAC inhibitors, and, in the fourth quarter of 2018, found no freedom to operate (FTO) issue for Ropidoxuridine used as radiosensitizer and used with tipiracil, and HDAC inhibitors SP-1-161 and SP-2-225.
 
Our strategy around protection of our proprietary technology, including any innovations and improvements, is to obtain worldwide patent coverage with a focus on jurisdictions that represent significant global pharmaceutical markets. Generally, patents have a term of twenty years from the earliest priority date, assuming that all maintenance fees are paid, no portion of the patent has been terminally disclaimed and the patent has not been invalidated. In certain jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances, patent terms can be extended or shortened. We are obtaining worldwide patent protection for at least novel molecules, composition of matter, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, including treatment of disease, methods of manufacture and other novel uses for the inventive molecules originating from our research and development efforts. We continuously assess whether it is strategically more favorable to maintain confidentiality for the “know-how” regarding a novel invention rather than pursue patent protection. For each patent application that is filed we strategically tailor our claims in accordance with the existing patent landscape around a particular technology.
 
There can be no assurance that an issued patent will remain valid and enforceable in a court of law through the entire patent term. Should the validity of a patent be challenged, the legal process associated with defending the patent can be costly and time consuming. Issued patents can be subject to oppositions, interferences and other third-party challenges that can result in the revocation of the patent limit patent claims such that patent coverage lacks sufficient breadth to protect subject matter that is commercially relevant. Competitors may be able to circumvent our patents. Development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays and it is possible that at the time of commercialization any patent covering the product has expired or will be in force for only a short period of time following commercialization. We cannot predict with any certainty if any third-party U.S. or foreign patent rights or other proprietary rights will be deemed infringed by the use of our technology. Nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. Should we need to defend ourselves and our partners against any such claims, substantial costs may be incurred. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from a third party. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license on a reasonable basis should we deem it necessary to obtain rights to an alternative technology that meets our needs. The failure to obtain a license may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets on a continuing basis. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.

It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive confidential information from us to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to these individuals during the course of the individual’s relationship with the company is to be kept confidential and is not to be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employee will be the property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection, preserve trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, both in the U.S. and other territories worldwide.
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of preclinical, clinical or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. We currently use a number of our suppliers for the raw materials and formulation to meet the preclinical and any clinical requirements of our product candidates. We do not have a long-term agreement with any of these parties and we believe alternative sources of supply exist.
 
We intend to enter into collaborations for the manufacture of our product candidates, with our collaborators assuming responsibility for such manufacturing. Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Any collaborator or third-party contract manufacturer we use would need to be compliant with cGMP. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans.
 
Competition
 
The development and commercialization of drugs is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of multinational pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, as well as technology being developed at universities and other research institutions. Our competitors have developed, are developing or will develop product candidates and processes competitive with our product candidates. Competitive therapeutic treatments include those that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community and any new treatments that enter the market. We believe that a significant number of products are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of conditions for which we may try to develop product candidates.
 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and supply resources or experience than we have. If we are able to obtain approval for any product candidate, we will face competition based on many different factors, including the quality and effectiveness of our products, the ease with which our products can be administered and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of administration, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products, the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, price, reimbursement coverage and patent position. Competing products could present superior treatment alternatives, including by being more effective, safer, and less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we may develop. Competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing our product candidates. Such competitors could also recruit our employees, which could negatively impact our level of expertise and our ability to execute our business plan.

Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an anti-metabolite used to treat cancer, by injection, for colon cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer. Fluorouracil was patented in 1956 and is an effective and safe drug with radiation sensitizing properties. Capecitabine, an orally available formulation of 5-FU and was patented in 1992. It is used for the treatment of gastric, esophageal and other cancers for sensitization to radiation therapy.
 
Cetuximab is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor used for the treatment of metastatic colorectal, lung cancer and head and neck cancers. This monoclonal antibody is administered by intravenous infusion and improves the 5-year survival of patients when used in combination with radiation therapy, compared with radiotherapy alone.
 
Platinum based compounds (cis-platin, carbo-platin and oxaloplatin) also exhibit radiation sensitizing properties. Platinum and radiation are used together for the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer and for head and neck cancers. Cisplatin is believed to augment the effects of radiation by inhibiting the repair of radiation-induced sub-lethal damage.
 
Bevacizumab works as an anti-angiogenic agent. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 2004. The addition of bevacizumab to standard treatment can prolong the lives of breast and lung cancer patients by several months and may be used with radiation therapy.
 
Irinotecan is given by injection and is used to treat colon cancer and small cell lung cancer and can be combined with radiation therapy. For colon cancer it is used either alone or with fluorouracil.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

U.S. government regulation
 
NDA approval processes
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:
 

● | refusal to approve pending applications; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------
● | withdrawal of an approval; 
● | imposition of a clinical hold; 
● | warning letters; 
● | product seizures; 
● | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or 
● | injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. 

 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to GLPs or other applicable regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to GCPs to produce data that the FDA may review to determine safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use; 
● | submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

 
Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring quality and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective thirty (30) days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the thirty (30) day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the quality and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined.
 

● | Phase I—The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for quality, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase II—Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
● | Phase III—Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage and produce data that the FDA may determine to establish clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

 
Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain and Phase I, Phase II and Phase III testing may not achieve desired results or otherwise be completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
During the development of a new product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase II to discuss their Phase II clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of the new drug. If a Phase II clinical trial is the subject of discussion at the end of Phase II meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase III clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.
 
According to published guidance on the SPA process, a sponsor which meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA is supposed to evaluate the protocol within forty-five (45) days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, which evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. An SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life.
 
The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested.

Expedited review and approval
 
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing product candidates, or provide for the approval of a product candidate on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, product candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of product candidates to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give product candidates that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten (10) months.
 
Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated product candidate and expedite review of the application for a product candidate designated for priority review. Accelerated approval, which is described in Subpart H of 21 CFR Part 314, provides for an earlier approval for a new product candidate that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.
 
In the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”), the U.S. Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of product candidates under accelerated approval. The law required the FDA to issue related draft guidance within a year after the law’s enactment and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. In June 2013, the FDA published a draft Guidance for Industry titled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions—Drugs and Biologics,” which provides guidance on FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new product candidates as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a product candidate is a candidate for these expedited development and review programs.
 
In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, the FDA also provided guidance on a new program for Breakthrough Therapy designation. The FDA defines a Breakthrough Therapy as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A drug designated as a Breakthrough Therapy is eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a Breakthrough Therapy. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. A request for Breakthrough Therapy designation should be submitted concurrently with, or as an amendment to an IND. FDA has already granted this designation to approximately thirty (30) new product candidates and has begun approving Breakthrough Therapy designated drugs.
 
Patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch- Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of fourteen (14) years from the product candidate’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half of the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product candidate is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A product candidate is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new product candidate containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the product candidate substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such product candidate where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b) (2) NDA, or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing product candidate. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for product candidates containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate quality and effectiveness.
 
Orphan drug designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to product candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a product candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that product candidate. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the FDA publicly discloses the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same product candidate for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product candidate as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product candidate for the same indication or disease.
 
Pediatric exclusivity and pediatric use
 
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”), certain product candidates may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a “Written Request”) relating to the use of the active moiety of the product candidate in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a product candidate in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
 
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most product candidates and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, biologics license application and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the quality and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product candidate or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete, or that additional quality or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. After April 2013, the FDA must send a noncompliance letter to any sponsor that fails to: submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current, or submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 
Post-approval requirements
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product candidate reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product candidate may result in restrictions on the product candidate or even complete withdrawal of the product candidate from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product candidate, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved product candidates that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product candidate based on the results of these post-marketing programs.

Any product candidates manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:
 

● | record-keeping requirements; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | reporting of adverse experiences with the product candidate; 
● | providing the FDA with updated data for the FDA’s continuing safety and efficacy determination; 
● | drug sampling and distribution requirements; 
● | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and 
● | complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. 

 
Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved product candidates are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
 
Regulation outside of the U.S.
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and is optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product.
 
Reimbursement
 
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutics committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to the U.S. Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the “ACA,” enacted in March 2010, had a significant impact on the health care industry by expanding coverage for the uninsured. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, ACA is expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. The administration and Congress which took office in January 2017, has pledged to repeal and replace the ACA, largely because of significantly increasing health insurance premiums and decreasing participation by members of the insurance companies. We cannot predict the impact of any repeal, replacement or modifications which may be enacted.
 
In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, product candidates launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.
 
Environment
 
Our third-party manufacturers are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.
Sales and Marketing
 
Our current focus is on the development of our existing portfolio, the completion of clinical trials and, if and where appropriate, the registration of our product candidates. We currently do not have marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. If we receive marketing and commercialization approval for any of our product candidates, we intend to market the product either directly or through collaborations, strategic alliances and distribution agreements with third parties. The ultimate implementation of our strategy for realizing the financial value of our product candidates is dependent on the results of clinical trials for our product candidates, the availability of funds and the ability to negotiate acceptable commercial terms with third parties.
Employees
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have seven employees, including our four executive officers, one engaged in research and development and two in administration. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Recent Financings – Our IPO and Post-2022 Financing
 
On September 2, 2022, we closed on our IPO of 1,225,888 units (each a “Unit,” and collectively, the “Units”), with each Unit consisting of one share of the Company’s common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock, at a public offering price of $8.125 per Unit. Our IPO, which was underwritten by Boustead Securities, LLC (“Boustead”), resulted in gross proceeds of $9,960,430, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. On September 29, 2022, Boustead exercised its overallotment option, purchasing an additional 183,883 Units, resulting in gross proceeds of $1,494,041, before deducting underwriter commissions and discounts. As a result, our IPO raised a total of $11,454,474, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and related IPO expenses.
 
On January 11, 2023, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with Alto Opportunity Master Fund, SPC – Segregated Master Portfolio B, a Cayman entity (the “Investor”), pursuant to which the Company sold to the Investor a $4.3 million convertible note (the “Convertible Note”) and warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase 1,018,079 shares of common stock of the Company, in exchange for gross proceeds of $4.0 million (the “Investment Amount”). The Convertible Note amortizes on a monthly basis and the Company can make such monthly amortization payments in cash or, subject to certain equity conditions, in registered shares of common stock or a combination thereof. For equity repayment, the Convertible Note is convertible into shares of common stock at price per share equal to the lower of (i) $2.35 (ii) 90% of the three lowest daily VWAPs of the 15 trading days prior to the payment date or (iii) 90% of the VWAP of the trading day prior to payment date. The Convertible Note is repayable over 26 months and bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum. The Warrant is exercisable for four years from the date of closing and is exercisable at $2.35 per share. In the event the Investor exercises the Warrant in full, such exercise would result in additional gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $2.4 million.
