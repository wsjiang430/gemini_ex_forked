  ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  Corporate History
  As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated, the terms we, us, our, Bullfrog Gold and the Company refer to Bullfrog Gold Corp., a Delaware corporation.  Bullfrog Gold Corp. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 23, 2007 as Kopr Resources Corp. On July 21, 2011, the Company changed its name to "Bullfrog Gold Corp.". The Company is in the exploration stage of its resource business.  Company Overview
 We are an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of properties that may contain gold and other mineralization primarily in the United States.  Bullfrog Project
  The Bullfrog Gold Project lies approximately 4 miles west of the town of Beatty, Nevada and 120 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2011, Standard Gold Corp. (Standard Gold) a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, initially acquired a 100% right, title and interest in 79 lode claims and 2 patented claims that contain approximately 1,600 acres subject to a 3% net smelter royalty.  On October 29, 2014, Rocky Mountain Minerals Corp. (RMM) a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Option Agreement (the Option) with Mojave Gold Mining Corporation (Mojave). Mojave holds and possesses the purchase rights to 100% of 12 patented mining claims located in Nye County, Nevada. This property is contiguous to the Companys Bullfrog Project and covers approximately 156 acres, including the northeast half of the Montgomery-Shoshone (M-S) pit mined by Barrick Gold in the 1990s.  Mojave granted to RMM the sole and immediate working right and option with respect to the property until the 10th anniversary of the closing date, to earn a 100% interest in and to the property free and clear of all charges encumbrances and claims, save and except a sliding scale Net smelter return (or NSR) royalty.  In order to maintain in force, the working right and Option granted to it, and to exercise the Option, the Company issued Mojave 750,000 shares of common stock and paid Mojave $16,000 in October 2014. In addition, to exercise the option, RMM must pay to Mojave a total of $190,000 over the next 10 years. For reference, Barrick Bullfrog Inc. (Barrick) terminated a lease on these patents after they ceased operations in late 1999.  On March 23, 2015, RMM entered into a Mineral Lease and Option to Purchase Agreement with Barrick involving 6 patented mining claims, 20 unpatented mining claims, and 8 mill site claims located approximately four miles west of Beatty, Nevada and covering approximately 444 acres (the Barrick Properties). These Barrick Properties are strategically located adjacent to the Companys Bullfrog Gold Project and include two patents that cover the southwest half of the M-S open pit from which Barrick produced approximately 220,000 ounces of gold by the late 1990s. Underground mining in the early 1900s produced approximately 70,000 ounces of gold from the M-S deposit. Also included in the agreement is the northern one third of the main Bullfrog deposit where Barrick mined approximately 2.1 million additional ounces by open pit and underground methods. In addition to prospective adjacent lands, these acquisitions provide the potential to expand the M-S deposit along strike and at depth and in the northern part of the main Bullfrog deposit.     1   The Company also has access to Barricks substantial data base within a 1.5-mile radius of the leased lands to further advance its exploration and development programs. To maintain the lease and option, the Company must spend $1.5 million dollars within five years on the Barrick Properties and to exercise the option the Company must issue to Barrick 3.25 million shares of the Companys common stock. The Company will also provide a 2% gross royalty on production from the Barrick Properties. Overriding royalties of 5% net smelter returns and 5% gross proceeds are respectively limited to three claims and two patents in the main Bullfrog pit area. Barrick has retained a back-in right to reacquire a 51% interest in the Barrick Properties, subject to definition of a mineral resource on the Barrick Properties meeting certain criteria and reimbursing the Company in an amount equal to two and one-half times Company expenditures on the Barrick Properties.  On July 24, 2017 the Company leased 24 patented claims from Lunar Landing LLC.  During 2017 the Company also staked and recorded 88 unpatented mining claims in the Bullfrog area.  On January 29, 2018 the Company purchased two patented claims, thereby eliminating minor constraints to expand the Bullfrog pit to the north.  In August 2018 and December 2018, the Company staked and recorded an additional 46 unpatented claims, for a total of 134 claims staked by the Company.  Significant drilling is required to test projections of mineralized trends and structures that extend for considerable distances to the north and east of the M-S pit on the original lands acquired by the Company in 2011. Located east of the M-S pit is an area 700 meters by 1,300 meters in which there is only one shallow hole from which there is no data available. Only a small portion of this area may be prospective, but we believe the area warrants additional study and exploration drilling.  There is only one drill hole located about 150 meters northeast of the M-S pit limit and another hole 1,000 meters northeast of the pit along strike of a major geologic structure. In this regard, the Companys lands extend nearly 5,000 meters north-northeast of the pit and there has been very little drilling in this area, even though several structures have been mapped by Barrick and others.  Barrick drilled twelve deep holes in the M-S area ranging from 318 meters to 549 meters. Notable mineral intercepts from four holes below the central part of the pit are summarized below:  
 | Intercept Data, Meters | Gold 
Hole No. | Thickness | Under Pit | g/t 
717 | 51.8 | 70 | 1.35
 | 18.3 | 135 | 0.59
 | 15.2 | 150 | 0.68
 | 160.0 | 180 | 0.96
732 | 10.7 | 200 | 0.84
 | 79.2 | 330 | 0.74
733 | 12.2 | 130 | 1.14
 | 13.7 | 220 | 0.75
 | 29.0 | 250 | 0.70
734 | 4.6 | 15 | 6.03
 | 21.3 | 70 | 1.43
 | 22.9 | 130 | 0.89
 | 4.6 | 190 | 1.04


These results demonstrate that substantial amounts of gold occur in an exceptionally large epithermal system that has good potential for expansion and possibly higher grades at depth. Three of these intercepts are less than 75 meters below the existing pit. Two holes located 40 meters and 90 meters east of the 160-meter interval in hole #717 contained no significant mineralization at this depth, whereas the 29 meters of mineral in hole #733 is 60 meters west and the mineral zone is open to the north, south and west.

For reference, Barrick terminated all mining and milling operations in the autumn of 1999 when their cash production costs exceeded gold prices that averaged less than $300 per ounce for the year and reached a low of $258/oz in August 1999. The economic margins for heap leaching lower grades at current gold prices near $1200/oz are deemed better than in 1999, and we believe the Company is positioned to explore such opportunities. Furthermore, Barrick never controlled or had access to a patented claim on the immediate east and north limits of the M-S pit, but this patent is owned by the Company.

Starting in 2015, the Company has studied Barricks entire electronic data base and much of their paper data base obtained from their Elko, Nevada and Salt Lake City, Utah offices. On August 9, 2017, an independent engineering firm issued estimates of mineralized materials totally contained on Company controlled lands. In January 2018 the Company purchased a patent that removed all remaining constraints for pit mining the mineralization, see summary below:

Mineralized material as used in this annual report on Form 10-K, although permissible under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Guide 7, does not indicate reserves by SEC standards. We cannot be certain that any part of the Companys deposits will ever be confirmed or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant reserves. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineralized material will be confirmed or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.

Input parameters used in the estimates are tabulated below:

Estimate Input Parameters


Parameter | Input | Unit 
Mining Cost - M & W | 2.25 | $/t 
Processing Cost | 6.00 | $/t 
General & Admin. | 1.60 | $/t 
Refining Sales | 0.05 | $/t 
Sell Cost | 10 | $/tr oz
Gold Recovery | 72 | % 
Silver Recovery | 20 | % 
Gold Price (3-yr average) | 1200 | $/tr oz
Pit Slopes | 45 | degrees


Mineral estimates are in place and do not include recoveries from a proposed downstream heap leach/processing operation. The mineral estimates herein are consistent with the policies and standards of Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101).

The data base used for the estimates included 1,262 holes containing 155 miles of coring and drilling completed from 1983 through 1996 by Barrick and its predecessors. Assaying was performed by several accredited laboratories. Tetra Tech, Inc. (Tetra Tech) a recognized global provider of engineering, technical and construction management services with particular expertise in the mining sector, reviewed the data base in detail and found it to be of sufficient quality and quantity to estimate mineralized materials. A final NI 43-101 Technical Report is posted on the Companys website.

The mineralized materials were estimated by the Golden, Colorado office of Tetra Tech. The estimates were prepared in accordance with requirements of NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. The technical work, analysis and findings were completed or directly supervised by Rex Bryan, PhD, who is as an independent "Qualified Person" as defined by NI 43-101. Mr. Bryan has also reviewed and approved the information in the June 27, 2017 news release.

An internal pit cutoff ranging between 0.20 to 0.36 g/t in the same base case pit shell provides an additional 99,000 ounces of gold averaging 0.26 g/t that is planned to be heap leached at a run-of-mine or uncrushed size. Thus, 624,000 ounces of mineralized materials grading 0.70 g/t are within this base case pit. From June 2017 through August 2018 the Company leased 24 patents and staked 111 mining claims to cover exploration targets and potential sites for leach pads and other project facilities.

For reference, the Company estimated in April 2016 a preliminary mineral inventory of 470,000 ounces grading 0.89 g/t using a nominal 0.3 g/t cutoff. In comparison, the mineralized materials of 624,000 ounces represents a 33% increase in gold ounces. As the existing pit slopes are up to 52 degrees and stable after 20 years of no mining, the 45-degree input by Tetra Tech is conservative and provides upside in final pit designs. It is also noted that Barrick terminated all mining by the end of 1998 and mill production in early 1999 when gold prices were less than $300 per ounce. However, economic margins for gold mining in general are now much better, particularly with the application of low-cost heap leaching methods. Barrick also used gold cut-off grades of 0.5 g/t in the pits and 3.0 g/t in the underground mine.

Metallurgy
 In February 2018 the Company collected a 1,800-pound random bulk sample in the north Bullfrog pit to conduct preliminary metallurgical testing using high pressure grinding rolls (HPGRs) to compare leaching with conventional crushing equipment. HPGRs are designed to produce a much finer product with significantly more micro-fractures, thereby increasing leach recovery. These initial tests were encouraging, and further sampling and testing is planned to fully document and support the probable use of HPGRs.

In 1994 Kappes Cassiday of Reno, NV performed simulated heap leach column tests on 250 kg samples with results as follows:


Size, inch | -1.5 | -3/8
Calc. Head, gold opt | .035 | .029
Rec., % | 71.4 | 75.9
Leach time, days | 41 | 41 


In 1995, Barrick performed a pilot heap leach test on 844 tons that were crushed to -½ inch and averaged 0.019 gold opt. In only 41 days of leaching, 67% of the gold was recovered while cyanide and lime consumptions were exceptionally low.

In 1986 St Joe column leached a 22-ton composite of minus 12-inch material grading 0.037 gold opt to simulate heap leaching material at a coarse run-of-mine (ROM) size and recovered 49% in 59 days of leaching, which they projected to 54% for leaching 90 days.

In summary, the Bullfrog Gold Project mineralization has good heap leach gold recoveries for crushing to 1.5 inch or less and at ROM size. The latter is particularly important since much additional low grade under 0.3 g/t that must be excavated from a pit could be ROM heap leached to supplement production.

Competition
 We do not compete directly with anyone for the exploration or removal of minerals from our property as we hold all interest and rights to the claims. Readily available commodities markets exist in the U.S. and around the world for the sale of minerals. Therefore, we will likely be able to sell minerals that we are able to recover. We will be subject to competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry in the event spot shortages arise for supplies such as explosives or large equipment tires, and certain equipment such as bulldozers and excavators and services, such as contract drilling that we will need to conduct exploration. If we are unsuccessful in securing the products, equipment and services we need, we may have to suspend our exploration plans until we are able to secure them.
Compliance with Government Regulation
 We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the United States generally. We will also be subject to the regulations of the BLM with respect to mining claims on Federal lands.

Future exploration drilling on the Bullfrog Project on BLM lands will require a Plan of Operations approved by the BLM since the area is designated desert tortoise habitat. A Plan of Operations can take several months to be approved, depending on the nature of the intended work, the level of reclamation bonding required, the need for archeological surveys, and other factors as may be determined by the BLM.

Research and Development
 As of the date of this filing we have had no expense related to research and development.

Employees
 As of the date of this filing, we employ 1 full-time employee, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. We have had contracts with various independent contractors and consultants to fulfill additional needs, including investor relations, exploration, development, permitting, and other administrative functions, and may staff further with employees as we expand activities and bring new projects on line.
