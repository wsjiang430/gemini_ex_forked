ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Corporate Profile
Cognex Corporation was incorporated in Massachusetts in 1981. Our corporate headquarters are located at One Vision Drive, Natick, Massachusetts 01760 and our telephone number is (508) 650-3000.
Cognex is a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate tasks, primarily in manufacturing processes, where vision is required. Machine vision products are used to automate the manufacture and tracking of discrete items, such as mobile phones, aspirin bottles, and automobile tires, by locating, identifying, inspecting, and measuring them during the manufacturing or distribution process. Machine vision is important for applications in which human vision is inadequate to meet requirements for size, accuracy, or speed, or in instances where substantial cost savings are obtained through the reduction of labor or improved product quality. Today, many types of manufacturing equipment require machine vision because of the increasing demands for speed and accuracy in manufacturing processes, as well as the decreasing size of items being manufactured.
What is Machine Vision?
Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, human vision has played an indispensable role in the process of manufacturing products. Human eyes did what no machines could do themselves: locating and positioning work, tracking the flow of parts, and inspecting output for quality and consistency. Today, however, the requirements of many manufacturing processes have surpassed the limits of human eyesight. Manufactured items often are produced too quickly or with tolerances too small to be analyzed by the human eye. In response to manufacturers’ needs, “machine vision” technology emerged, providing manufacturing equipment with the gift of sight. Machine vision systems were first widely embraced by manufacturers of electronic components who needed this technology to produce computer chips with decreasing geometries. However, advances in technology and ease-of-use, combined with the decreasing cost of implementing vision applications, have made machine vision available to a broader range of users.

Machine vision products combine cameras with innovativesoftware to collect images and then answer questions about these images, such as:

Question | Description | Example 
GUIDANCE | | 
Where is it? | Determining the exact physical location and orientation of an object. | Determining the position of a printed circuit board so that a robot can automatically be guided to place electronic components. 
IDENTIFICATION | | 
What is it? | Identifying an object by analyzing its physical appearance or by reading a serial number or symbol. | Reading a two-dimensional barcode directly marked on an automotive airbag so that it can be tracked and processed correctly through manufacturing.
INSPECTION | | 
How good is it? | Inspecting an object for flaws or defects. | Checking for debris to ensure that foreign objects are not present in a product before shipping to consumers. 
GAUGING | | 
What size is it? | Determining the dimensions of an object. | Determining the diameter of a bearing prior to final assembly.

Business Strategy
Our goal is to expand our position as a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products. We are selective in choosing growth opportunities that we believe will maintain our historically high gross margin percentages, which have ranged in the mid 70s for the past several years and reflect the value our customers place on our innovative products. Our strong and unique corporate culture reinforces our values of customer first and innovation, and enables us to attract and retain smart, highly-educated, experienced talent who are motivated to solve the most challenging vision tasks.
We invest heavily in research and development in order to maintain our position as a technology leader in machine vision. We invest in technology that makes vision easier to use and more affordable, and therefore, available to a broader base of customers, such as our vision sensor products that enable customers with a lower budget to use machine vision without the help of sophisticated engineers. We also invest in technology that addresses the most challenging vision applications, such as our 3D vision products that solve applications where a height or volume measurement is required. We identify large customers with high-volume applications and offer them collaborative development to deliver solutions to solve their complex vision problems. 
We continue to invest in our core markets, such as consumer electronics and automotive, where we are a leading provider of vision and ID products for factory automation, while we seek opportunities to expand into adjacent markets for vision, such as logistics, airport baggage handling, mobile terminals, life sciences, and collaborative robotics. We invest through internal development, as well as the acquisition of businesses and technologies.
We reach a broad base of customers through our worldwide direct sales force that sells to large, strategic customers, as well as through our network of distributors and integrators that sell primarily to smaller customers who may be more geographically remote. We invest in emerging, high-growth regions where many manufacturers can benefit from 
2

incorporating machine vision into their production processes. This includes investment in China, where rising wages for assembly workers and a greater focus on product quality are driving assembly automation, particularly in the consumer electronics industry.
Acquisitions
Our business strategy includes selective expansion into new machine vision applications and markets through the acquisition of businesses and technologies. In 2017 and 2016, we completed six small business acquisitions, which were not significant individually or in the aggregate. The purchase price for each business ranged from $2.5 million to $23 million. In addition to completed technology and customer relationships, these acquisitions included engineering talent expected to help accelerate the development of future products. Management considers business acquisitions to be an important part of our growth strategy, and although we continue to actively seek out acquisition opportunities, we are selective in choosing businesses that we believe will enhance our long-term growth rate and profitability. We plan to continue to seek opportunities to expand our product lines, customer base, distribution network, and technical talent through acquisitions in the machine vision industry. 
Products
Cognex offers a full range of vision and ID products designed to meet customer needs at different performance and price points. Our products range from low-cost vision sensors that are easily integrated, to PC-based systems for users with more experience or more complex requirements. Our products also have a variety of physical forms, depending upon the user's needs. For example, customers can purchase vision software to use with their own camera and processor, or they can purchase a standalone unit that combines camera, processor, and software into a single package.
Vision Software
Vision software provides users with the most flexibility by combining the full general-purpose library of Cognex vision tools with the cameras, frame grabbers, and peripheral equipment of their choice. Applications based upon Cognex vision software perform a wide range of vision tasks, including part location, identification, measurement, assembly verification, and robotic guidance. Cognex's VisionPro® software offers an extensive suite of patented vision tools for advanced programming, while Cognex Designer allows customers to build complete vision applications with the simplicity of a graphical, flowchart-based programming environment. Cognex ViDi deep learning-based image analysis software solves complex applications that are too complicated and time-consuming to program and maintain with traditional machine vision rules-based algorithms.
Vision Systems and Sensors
Vision systems combine camera, processor, and vision software into a single, rugged package with a simple and flexible user interface for configuring applications. General-purpose vision systems are designed to be easily programmed to perform a wide range of vision tasks including part location, identification, measurement, assembly verification, and robotic guidance. Unlike general-purpose vision systems, vision sensors are designed to deliver very simple, low-cost, reliable solutions for a limited number of common vision applications such as checking the presence and size of parts. Cognex offers the In-Sight® product line of vision systems in a wide range of models to meet various price and performance requirements. Cognex also offers a series of 3D vision systems for use in highly demanding applications that require surface feature measurements that go beyond the capabilities of 2D vision technology. 
ID Products
ID products quickly and reliably read codes (e.g., one-dimensional barcodes or two-dimensional data matrix codes) that have been applied to, or directly marked on, discrete items during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers of goods ranging from automotive parts, pharmaceutical items, aircraft components, and medical devices are increasingly using direct part mark (DPM) identification to ensure that the appropriate manufacturing processes are performed in the correct sequence and on the right parts. In addition, DPM is used to track parts from the beginning of their life to the end, and is also used in supply chain management and repair.
ID products are also used outside of the manufacturing sector to automate distribution processes in the logistics industry for applications in retail distribution and ecommerce to scan, track, and sort goods through distribution centers. Cognex offers the DataMan® product line of image-based barcode readers, which includes both hand-held and fixed-mount models, and barcode verifiers, as well as the MX Series of vision-enabled Mobile Terminals that allow customers to leverage the latest mobile device technology for industrial barcode reading applications.
