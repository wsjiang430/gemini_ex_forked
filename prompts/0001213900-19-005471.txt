ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
 
GrowGeneration Corp. (together with all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively “GrowGeneration” the “Company”) was incorporated in Colorado in 2014 to build a national chain of hydroponic equipment and supply garden centers in the U.S. Today, GrowGeneration is a leading marketer and distributor of nutrients, growing media, advanced indoor garden, lighting and ventilation systems and accessories for hydroponic gardening. As of December 31, 2018, we have grown into a chain of eighteen (18) retail hydroponic/garden centers, in 7 states, with five (5) located in Colorado, six (6) in California, one (1) in Nevada, one (1) in the Washington, one (1) in Rhode Island, one (1) in Oklahoma and three (3) in Michigan. In the first quarter of 2019, we acquired three (3) new hydroponic stores, one each in California, Colorado and Nevada and we opened new stores in Oklahoma and Maine. In addition, during the first quarter of 2019, we consolidated two stores both in California and Colorado. GrowGeneration expansion plan includes both acquiring existing hydroponic operations, as well as opening up garden centers in selected markets. Our 21 garden stores have been owned and operated through 7 wholly owned subsidiaries.

Products
 
GrowGeneration is one of the largest retailers of hydroponic products in the United States and is engaged in the business of marketing and distributing horticultural, organics, lighting and hydroponics products, including lighting fixtures, nutrients, seeds and growing media, systems, trays, fans, filters, humidifiers and dehumidifiers, timers, instruments, water pumps, irrigation supplies and hand tools.

● | GrowGeneration is also actively seeking to either acquire or establishment private labeled products, which would be sold through GrowGeneration garden centers under brands owned or controlled by the Company. In this regard, the Company acquired a variety of trademarks in March 2019 to bolsters its ability to supply branded ‘house’ products to our customers. From trellis netting, to plastic pots, to organic nutrients, GrowGeneration expects to roll out a complete line of private labeled products to offer our customers at great prices, which is expected to have a positive impact on margins and profitability in the near term.

Markets
 
GrowGeneration serves a new, yet sophisticated community of commercial and urban cultivators growing specialty crops including organics, greens and plant-based medicines. Unlike the traditional agricultural industry, these cultivators use innovative indoor and outdoor growing techniques to produce specialty crops in highly controlled environments. This enables them to produce crops at higher yields without having to compromise quality, regardless of the season or weather and drought conditions.
 
Indoor growing techniques have primarily been used to cultivate plant-based medicines. Plant-based medicines often require high-degree of regulation and controls including government compliance, security, and crop consistency, making indoor growing techniques a preferred method. Cultivators of plant-based medicines often make a significant investment to design and build-out their facilities. They look to work with companies such as GrowGeneration that understand their specific needs and can help mitigate risks that could jeopardize their crops. Plant-based medicines are believed to be among the fastest-growing market in the U.S. and several industry pundits believe that plant-based medicines may even displace prescription pain medication by providing patients with a safer, more affordable alternative.
 
Indoor growing techniques, however, are not limited to plant-based medicines. Vertical farms producing organic fruits and vegetables are beginning to emerge in the market due to a rising shortage of farmland, and environmental vulnerabilities including drought, other severe weather conditions and insect pests. Indoor growing techniques enable cultivators to grow crops all-year-round in urban areas and take up less ground while minimizing environmental risks. Indoor growing techniques typically require a more significant upfront investment to design and build-out these facilities than traditional farmlands. If new innovations lower the costs for indoor growing, and the costs to operate traditional farmlands continue to rise, then indoor growing techniques may be a compelling alternative for the broader agricultural industry.

Research and Development

The Company has not incurred any research and development expenses during the period covered by this report.
 
Customers and Suppliers
 
Our key customers vary by state and are expected to be more defined as the Company moves from its retail walk-in purchasing sales strategy to serving cultivation facilities directly and under predictable purchasing activity. Currently, none of our customers accounted for more than 5% of our sales in 2018 or 2017.
 
Our key suppliers include several manufacturers and distributors such as FoxFarm Fertilizer, Canna, USA Mills Nutrients, Sunlight Supply, Hydrofarm, and others. All the products purchased and sold are applicable to indoor and outdoor growing for organics, greens, and plant-based medicines. As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, two suppliers represent 56% and 61% of our purchases, respectively. The Company is of the opinion that the loss of either supplier would not have a material adverse impact on our business, because both suppliers provide the same products and the Company maintains direct manufacturing agreements with vendors.
 
Demand for Products
 
Demand for indoor and outdoor growing equipment is currently high due to legalization of plant-based medicines, primarily Cannabis, which requires equipment purchases for build-out and repeat purchases of consumable nutrients needed during the growing period. This demand is projected to continue to increase as a result of the approval of a comprehensive, publicly available medical marijuana/cannabis programs laws in 34 states and the District of Columbia as of the date thereof. Continued innovation and more efficient build-out technologies along with larger and consolidated cultivation facilities are expected to further expand market demand for GrowGeneration products and services. We expect the market to continue to segment into urban farmers serving groups of individuals, community cultivators, and large-scale cultivation facilities across the states. Each segment will be optimized to different distribution channels that GrowGeneration currently provides. We are of the opinion that as our volume increases, we will obtain volume discounts on purchasing that should allow us to maximize our revenues and expand gross profit margins.
 
E-Commerce Strategy
 
The Company has developed its e-commerce website and portal, www.growgeneration.com and www.heavygardens.com which offers for sale hydroponic, specialty and organic gardening products. Online shoppers are able to shop from product departments, from nutrients to lighting to hydroponic and greenhouse equipment, delivering an easy and quick method to find the products that they want to purchase. Our e-commerce site is designed to appeal to the professional growers. Each product listed on the site contains product descriptions, product reviews and a picture so the customers can make an informed and educated purchase. Our product filters allow the customers to search by brand, manufacturer, or by function such as wattage. Designed as an information portal as well as an e-commerce store, the customers will find videos, articles, blogs and other relevant content, all generated by GrowGeneration’s internal staff, which we call our “Grow Pros”. The GrowGeneration customers are able to shop and order online 24/7 and, choose to receive products delivered directly to their grow operations, or for pick up at one of the GrowGeneration retail stores. In addition, customers may simply use our site as a resource and shop with our Grow Pros at one of our retail locations. Google advertising, social media and in store advertising are the primary advertising tools we use to drive traffic to www.growgeneration.com.

Seasonality
 
Our business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second and third fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs during our first or fourth fiscal quarter. 
Competition
 
The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. Our key competitors include many local and national vendors of gardening supplies, local product resellers of hydroponic and other specialty growing equipment, as well as online product resellers and large online marketplaces such as Amazon.com and eBay. Our industry is a highly fragmented industry with over 1,000 retail outlets throughout the U.S. We compete with companies that have greater capital resources, facilities and diversity of product lines. Our competitors may also introduce new hydroponic growing equipment, manufacturers may sell equipment direct to consumers, and our distributers could cease sales of product to us.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do believe that our pricing, inventory and product availability and overall customer service provide us with the ability to compete in this marketplace. In addition, as we increase our number of stores and inventory per store, we expect to be able to purchase larger amounts of inventory at lower volume sale prices, which we expect will enable us to price competitively and deliver the products that our customers are seeking. We compete on supply chain competency, field sales support, in-store sales support, the strength of our relationships with major manufacturers, distributors and advertising, that as we expand our national brand with operations, in multiple states, we will be able to retain and acquire customers for our products
 
Based on our knowledge and communication with our suppliers, we do not believe our suppliers sell directly to the retail market or our customers.

Government Regulation
 
We sell products, including hydroponic gardening products, that end users may purchase for use in new and emerging industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis, that may not grow or achieve market acceptance in a manner that we can predict. The demand for these products depends on the uncertain growth of these industries or segments. 
 
In addition, we sell products that end users may purchase for use in industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis, that are subject to varying, inconsistent, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions.  For example, certain countries and 33 U.S. states have adopted frameworks that authorize, regulate, and tax the cultivation, processing, sale, and use of cannabis for medicinal and/or non-medicinal use, while the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and the laws of other U.S. states prohibit growing cannabis.
 
Our gardening products, including our hydroponic gardening products, are multi-purpose products designed and intended for growing a wide range of plants and are purchased by cultivators who may grow any variety of plants, including cannabis.  Although the demand for our products may be negatively impacted depending on how laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions develop, we cannot reasonably predict the nature of such developments or the effect, if any, that such developments could have on our business.
