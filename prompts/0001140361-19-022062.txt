Historically, the Company has vigorously defended its intellectual property rights and expects to continue to do so.
Supply Chain and Sourcing of Materials
 
The Company manufactures some products that use parts or materials that, due to geographical distance, limited supplier capacity or availability or competing demands for such parts or materials, are only available in a cost effective manner from a single vendor or require the Company to place orders several months in advance of required delivery.
 
The Company attempts to mitigate product availability and these supply chain risks when possible through the purchase of safety stock, use of forecast-based supply contracts, and, to a lesser extent, with just in time inventory deliveries or supplier-owned inventory located close to the Company’s manufacturing locations.  The Company strives to balance the businesses’ need to maintain adequate inventory levels with the cost of holding such inventory by manufacturing to forecast for high volume products, utilizing build-to-order strategies wherever possible, and by having contract-manufactured products delivered to customers directly from the supplier.  The Company also seeks to manage its inventory through on-going product design and logistical initiatives with its suppliers to reduce lead times.
 
As most military contracts require utilization of domestic suppliers, the Company is limited to key vendors for materials used in its military tent business.

  Table of Contents     Seasonality
 
The Company’s products are primarily warm-weather, outdoor recreation-related, which results in seasonal variations in sales and profitability for the Company. This seasonal variability is due to customers’ increasing their inventories in the quarters ending March and June, the primary selling season for the Company’s outdoor recreation products, with lower inventory volumes during the quarters ending September and December. The Company mitigates the seasonality of its businesses somewhat by encouraging customers to purchase and take delivery of products more evenly through the year.  The following table shows, for the past three fiscal years, the total consolidated net sales and operating profit or loss of the Company for each quarter, as a percentage of the total year.

 | Fiscal Year | 
--------------+-------------+----
 | 2019 | | | 2018 | | 2017
