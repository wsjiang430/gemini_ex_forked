Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a commercial-stage company that develops and sells high performance water solutions to the medical and commercial markets.
 
In medical markets, we sell water filtration products. Our medical water filters, mostly classified as ultrafilters, are used primarily by hospitals for the prevention of infection from waterborne pathogens, such as legionella and pseudomonas, and in dialysis centers for the removal of biological contaminants from water and bicarbonate concentrate. Because our ultrafilters capture contaminants as small as 0.005 microns in size, they minimize exposure to a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and endotoxins.
 
In commercial markets, we manufacture and sell water filters that improve the taste and odor of water and reduce biofilm, bacteria, and scale build-up in downstream equipment. Our products are marketed primarily to the food service, hospitality, convenience store, and health care markets. These commercial products are also marketed into medical markets, as supplemental filtration to our medical filters.
 
We were founded in 1997 by healthcare professionals affiliated with Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital to develop and commercialize an alternative method to hemodialysis. We have extended our filtration technologies to meet the demand for liquid purification in other areas, in particular, water purification.
 
Our Products
 
Water Filtration Products
 
We develop and sell water filtration products used in both medical and commercial applications. Our water filtration products employ multiple filtration technologies, as described below.

In medical markets, our primary filtration mechanism is to pass liquids through the pores of polysulfone hollow fiber. Our filters’ pores are significantly smaller than those of competing products, resulting in highly effective elimination of waterborne pathogens, including legionella bacteria (the cause of Legionnaires disease) and viruses, which are not eliminated by most other microbiological filters on the market. Additionally, the fiber structure and pore density in our hollow fiber enables significantly higher flow rates than in other polysulfone hollow fiber.
 
Our primary sales strategy in medical markets is to sell through value-added resellers (“VARs”). Leveraging VARs has enabled us to expand rapidly our access to target customers with limited sales staff expansion. In addition, while we are currently focused on medical markets, the VARs that support these customers also support a wide variety of commercial and industrial customers. We believe that our VAR relationships have and will continue to facilitate growth in filter sales outside of the medical industry.
 
In commercial markets, we develop and sell our filters, for which carbon-based absorption is the primary filtration mechanism. These products allow us to improve water’s odor and taste, to reduce scale and heavy metals, and to reduce other water contaminants for customers who are primarily in the food service, convenience store, and hospitality industries. These commercial products are also sold into medical markets, as supplemental filtration to our medical filters.
 
In commercial markets, our model combines both direct and indirect sales. Our sales staff have sold products directly to a number of convenience stores, hotels, casinos, and restaurants. We are also pursuing large corporate contracts through partnerships.
 
Target Markets
 
Our ultrafiltration products currently target the following markets:
 

● | Hospitals and Other Healthcare Facilities: Filtration of water for washing and drinking as an aid in infection control. The filters produce water that is suitable for wound cleansing, cleaning of equipment used in medical procedures, and washing of surgeons’ hands. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Dialysis Centers and Home/Portable Dialysis Machines: Filtration of water or bicarbonate concentrate used in hemodialysis. 
● | Commercial Facilities: Filtration and purification of water for consumption, including for use in ice machines and soft drink dispensers. 
● | Military and Outdoor Recreation: Individual water purification devices used by soldiers and backpackers to produce drinking water in the field, as well as filters customized to remote water processing systems. 

 
Hospitals and Other Healthcare Facilities. Nephros filters are a leading tool used to provide proactive protection to patients in high-risk areas (e.g., ice machines, surgical rooms, NICUs) and reactive protection to patients in broader areas during periods of water pathogen outbreaks. Our products are used in hundreds of medical facilities to aid in infection control, both proactively and reactively.
 
As of 2022, according to the American Hospital Association, there are approximately 6,100 hospitals in the U.S., with approximately 921,000 beds. Over 33 million patients were admitted to these hospitals. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) estimates that healthcare associated infections (“HAI”) occur in approximately 1 out of every 31 hospital patients, which calculates to over one million patients in 2022. HAIs affect patients in hospitals or other healthcare facilities and are not present or incubating at the time of admission. They also include infections acquired by patients in the hospital or facility, but appearing after discharge, and occupational infections among staff. Many HAIs are caused by waterborne bacteria and viruses that can thrive in aging or complex plumbing systems often found in healthcare facilities.

In January 2022, the Center for Clinical Standards and Quality at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) expanded its requirements – originally implemented in 2017 – for facilities to develop policies and procedures that inhibit the growth and spread of legionella and other opportunistic pathogens in building water systems. In this 2022 update, CMS requires teams to be assigned to the development of formal water management plans (“WMPs”), as well as detailed documentation regarding the development of the WMPs and their execution. CMS surveyors regularly review policies, procedures, and reports documenting water management implementation results to verify that facilities are compliant with these requirements. We believe that these CMS regulations may have a positive impact on the sale of our HAI-inhibiting ultrafilters.
 
We currently have FDA 510(k) clearance on the following portfolio of medical device products for use in the hospital setting to aid in infection control:
 

● | The DSU-H and SSU-H are in-line, 0.005-micron ultrafilters that provide dual- and single-stage protection, respectively, from waterborne pathogens. They are primarily used to filter potable water feeding ice machines, sinks, and medical equipment, such as endoscope washers and surgical room humidifiers. The DSU-H has an up to 6-month product life in a typical hospital setting, while the SSU-H has an up to 3-month product life. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The S100 is a point-of-use, 0.01-micron microfilter that provides protection from waterborne pathogens. The S100 is primarily used to filter potable water feeding sinks and showers. The S100 has an up to 3-month product life when used in a hospital setting. 
● | The HydraGuardTM and HydraGuardTM - Flush are 0.005-micron cartridge ultrafilters that provide single-stage protection from waterborne pathogens. The HydraGuard ultrafilters are primarily used to filter potable water feeding ice machines and medical equipment, such as endoscope washers and surgical room humidifiers. The HydraGuard has an up to 6-month product life and the HydraGuard - Flush has an up to 12-month product life when used in a hospital setting. 

 
Our complete hospital infection control product line, including in-line, and point-of-use can be viewed on our website at https://www.nephros.com/infection-control/. We are not including the information on our website as a part of, nor incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Dialysis Centers - Water/Bicarbonate. In the dialysis water market, Nephros ultrafiltration products are among the highest performing products on the market. The DSU-D, SSU-D and the SSUmini have become the standard endotoxin filter in many portable reverse osmosis systems. The EndoPur®, our large-format ultrafilter targeted at dialysis clinic water systems, provides the smallest pore size available.
 
To perform hemodialysis, all dialysis clinics have dedicated water purification systems to produce water and bicarbonate concentrate, two essential ingredients for making dialysate, the liquid that removes waste material from the blood. According to the American Journal of Kidney Diseases, there are approximately 6,500 dialysis clinics in the United States servicing approximately 468,000 patients annually. We estimate that there are over 100,000 hemodialysis machines in operation in the United States.
 
Medicare is the main payer for dialysis treatment in the United States. To be eligible for Medicare reimbursement, dialysis centers must meet the minimum standards for water and bicarbonate concentrate quality set by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (“AAMI”), the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”) and the International Standards Organization (“ISO”). We anticipate that the stricter standards approved by these organizations in 2009 will be adopted by Medicare in the future.
 
We currently have FDA 510(k) clearance on the following portfolio of medical device products for use in the dialysis setting to aid in bacteria, virus, and endotoxin retention:
 

● | The DSU-D, SSU-D and SSUmini are in-line, 0.005-micron ultrafilters that provide protection from bacteria, viruses, and endotoxins. All of these products have an up to 12-month product life in the dialysis setting and are used to filter water following treatment with a reverse osmosis (“RO”) system, and to filter bicarbonate concentrate. These ultrafilters are primarily used in the water lines and bicarbonate concentrate lines leading into dialysis machines, and as a polish filter for portable RO machines. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The EndoPur is a 0.005-micron cartridge ultrafilter that provides single-stage protection from bacteria, viruses, and endotoxins. The EndoPur has an up to 12-month product life in the dialysis setting and is used to filter water following treatment with an RO system. More specifically, the EndoPur is used primarily to filter water in large RO systems designed to provide ultrapure water to an entire dialysis clinic. The EndoPur is a cartridge-based, “plug and play” market entry that requires no plumbing at installation or replacement. The EndoPur is available in 10”, 20”, and 30” configuration.

Commercial and Industrial Facilities. Our commercial NanoGuard® product line accomplishes ultrafiltration via small pore size (0.005 micron) technology, filtering bacteria and viruses from water. In addition, our commercial filtration offerings include technologies that are primarily focused on improving odor and taste and on reducing scale and heavy metals from filtered water.
 
Our commercial market focus is on the hotel, restaurant, and convenience store markets. In March 2022, we closed a contract to provide water filtration systems to an organization of approximately 3,000 Quick Service Restaurants (“QSR”). We continue to pursue other national accounts, which may result in step-change increases in commercial market revenue.
 
Over time, we believe that the same water safety management programs currently underway at medical facilities may migrate to commercial markets. As the epidemiology of waterborne pathogens expands, links to contamination sources will become more efficient and the data more readily available. In cases where those sources are linked to restaurants, hotels, office buildings and residential complexes, the corporate owners of those facilities will likely face increasing liability exposure. We expect that building owners will come to understand ASHRAE-188, which outlines risk factors for buildings and their occupants, and provides water safety management guidelines. We believe, in time, most commercial buildings will need to follow the basic requirements of ASHRAE-188: create a water management plan, perform routine testing, and establish a plan to treat the building in the event of a positive test.
 
As demand for water testing and microbiological filtration grows, we will be ready to deploy our expertise and solutions based on years of experience servicing the medical market. We believe that we have an opportunity to offer unique expertise and products to the commercial market, and that our future revenue from the commercial market could even surpass our infection control revenue.
 
We currently market the following portfolio of proprietary products for use in the commercial, industrial, and food service settings:
 

● | The NanoGuard set of products are in-line, 0.005-micron ultrafilter that provides dual-stage retention of any organic or inorganic particle larger than 15,000 Daltons. NanoGuard products are designed to fit a variety of existing plumbing configurations, including 10” and 20” standard housings, and Nephros and Everpure® manifolds. Included in the NanoGuard product line are both conventional and flushable filters. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Nephros line of commercial filters provide a variety of technology solutions that improve water quality in food service, convenience store, hospitality, and industrial applications. Nephros filters improve water taste and odor, and reduce sediment, dirt, rust particles and other solids, chlorine and heavy minerals, lime scale build-up, and both particulate lead and soluble lead. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Nephros commercial products combine effectively with NanoGuard ultrafiltration technologies to offer full-featured solutions to the commercial water market, including to existing users of Everpure filter manifolds.

Pathogen Detection Systems
 
In 2019, we expanded our portfolio of water solutions with the introduction of pathogen detection system (“PDS”) products and services, including our PluraPath pathogen detection system, which we developed to provide real-time data regarding the existence of a broad array of waterborne pathogens to the infection control teams responsible executing a building or other facility’s water management plans. In the third quarter of 2021, we acquired the business of GenArraytion, Inc. (“GenArraytion” ), including GenArraytion’s many proprietary assays, multiplexing technology, and selection methods for detecting waterborne pathogens and other microorganisms using Polymerase Chain Reaction technology. GenArraytion’s assets was integrated into our PDS segment. In November 2022, we sold substantially all of our assets used in our PDS business to BWSI, LLC pursuant to the terms of an Agreement for Purchase and Sale of Assets with BWSI (the “PDS Purchase Agreement”). Under the terms of the PDS Purchase Agreement, BWSI made a nominal cash payment at the closing of the transaction and assumed certain continuing liabilities of the PDS business. Additionally, for a period of seven years commencing January 1, 2023, and ending December 31, 2029, BWSI will pay us an annual royalty equal to a specified percentage of gross margin received by BWSI from each of the sale and licensing of products developed by the PDS Business.
Hemodiafiltration (HDF) Systems and Specialty Renal Products, Inc.


The current standard of care in the United States for patients with chronic renal failure is hemodialysis (“HD”), a process in which toxins are cleared via diffusion. Patients typically receive HD treatments at least 3 times weekly for 3-4 hours per treatment. HD is most effective in removing smaller, easily diffusible toxins. For patients with acute renal failure, the current standard of care in the United States is hemofiltration (“HF”), a process where toxins are cleared via convection. HF offers a much better removal of larger sized toxins when compared to HD; however, HF treatment is more challenging for patients, as it is performed daily, and typically takes 12-24 hours per treatment.
 
Our company was originally founded to develop and commercialize a hemodiafiltration (“HDF”) medical device. HDF is an alternative dialysis modality that combines the benefits of HD and HF into a single therapy by clearing toxins using both diffusion and convection. Though not widely used in the United States, HDF is prevalent in Europe and is performed for a growing number of patients. Clinical experience and literature demonstrate that HDF’s benefits, among other factors, include enhanced clearance of middle and large molecular weight toxins, improved patient survival, reduced incidence of dialysis-related amyloidosis, improved patient quality of life and reduced hospitalizations and overall length of stays.

Our original HDF device
 
(“HDF1”) was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure in 2012, but did not gain market acceptance due to, among other reasons, the feeling that it was too difficult to use. Accordingly, since 2018, we have undertaken to redesign and dramatically simplify our HDF device. We believe our updates have made the system significantly easier to use.
 
In 2018, we spun-off the development of the second-generation HDF device (“HDF2”) into a newly-formed subsidiary, Specialty Renal Products, Inc. (“SRP”) and shortly thereafter SRP raised $3 million of outside equity capital directly to fund the second-generation development described above. We maintain a 62.5% ownership stake in SRP. In February 2022, SRP raised an additional $0.5 million of equity capital, including an investment by Nephros of $0.3 million, which was sufficient to maintain our 62.5% ownership stake in SRP. In addition to the equity capital raised by SRP, in December 2020, we entered into a loan agreement with SRP under which we loaned $1.3 million to SRP. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of this loan, including accrued interest, was approximately $1.4 million.
 
In May 2022, the FDA cleared HDF2 for patient use, which enables nephrologists to provide HDF treatment to patients with end stage renal disease. To date, our and SRP’s HDF1 and HDF2 systems are the only HDF systems cleared by the FDA.
 
Following FDA clearance of HDF2, SRP’s management began exploring strategic partnerships and/or potential additional sources of financing to support a commercial launch of the HDF2 device but has been unsuccessful in identifying any interested strategic partner or investor. By late February 2023, SRP had nearly exhausted its capital resources.
 
In March 2023, SRP’s board of directors and stockholders determined to wind down SRP operations and liquidate its remaining assets, due to capital constraints. SRP’s cash resources are sufficient to satisfy all of its outstanding liabilities other than its outstanding loan to us. Accordingly, we expect that SRP will assign all of its remaining assets, including its intellectual property rights in the HDF2 device, to us in partial satisfaction of its outstanding loan balance of approximately $1.4 million. Although we have no current plans to do so, we may re-evaluate opportunities for the HDF2 device in the future.

Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
We do not, and do not intend to in the near future, manufacture any of our medical device filtration products. We do manufacture some of our commercial filtration products in our facility in Las Vegas, Nevada.
 
On April 23, 2012, we entered into a License and Supply Agreement (the “License and Supply Agreement”) with Medica S.p.A. (“Medica”), an Italy-based medical product manufacturing company, for the marketing and sale of certain filtration products based upon Medica’s proprietary Medisulfone ultrafiltration technology in conjunction with our filtration products, and for an exclusive supply arrangement for the filtration products. Under the License and Supply Agreement, as amended, Medica granted to us an exclusive license, with right of sublicense, to market, promote, distribute, offer for sale and sell the filtration products worldwide, with certain limitations on territory, during the term of the License and Supply Agreement. In addition, we granted to Medica an exclusive license under our intellectual property to make the filtration products during the term of the License and Supply Agreement. The filtration covered under the License and Supply Agreement include both certain products based on Medica’s proprietary Versatile microfiber technology and certain filtration products based on Medica’s proprietary Medisulfone ultrafiltration technology. The term of the License and Supply Agreement with Medica expires on December 31, 2025, unless earlier terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the License and Supply Agreement. We currently have an understanding with Medica whereby we have agreed to pay interest to Medica at a 12% annual rate calculated on the principal amount of any outstanding invoices that are not paid pursuant to the original payment terms.
 
In exchange for the rights granted, we agreed to make minimum annual aggregate purchases from Medica throughout the term of the License and Supply Agreement. As part of the License and Supply Agreement, we granted to Medica a 10-year option to purchase 300,000 shares of our common stock. Such options expired in April 2022.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our New Jersey headquarters oversees global sales and marketing activity of our ultrafilter products. We work with multiple distributors for our ultrafilter products in the hospital and dialysis water markets. For the food service and hospitality markets, we have contracted with Donastar LLC as our master distributor. For other prospective markets for our ultrafilter products, we are pursuing alliance opportunities for joint product development and/or distribution. Our ultrafilter manufacturer in Europe shares certain intellectual property rights with us for one of our dual stage ultrafilter designs.
Research and Development
 
Our research and development efforts continue on several fronts directly related to our current product lines. For the ultrafiltration systems business, we are continually working with existing and potential distributors of ultrafilter products to develop solutions to meet customer needs.

Competition
 
With respect to the water filtration market, we compete with companies that are well-entrenched in the water filtration domain. These companies include Pall Corporation (wholly owned by Danaher Corporation), which manufactures point-of-use microfiltration products, as well as 3M and Pentair, who manufacture the Cuno® and Everpure® brands of water filtration and purification products, respectively. Our methods of competition in the water filtration domain include:

● | developing and marketing products that are designed to meet critical and specific customer needs more effectively than competitive devices; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | offering unique attributes that illustrate our product reliability, “user-friendliness,” and performance capabilities; 
● | selling products to specific customer groups where our unique product attributes are mission-critical; and 
● | pursuing alliance and/or acquisition opportunities for joint product development and distribution. 

Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
We protect our technology and products through patents and patent applications. In addition to the United States, we also apply for patents in other jurisdictions, such as the European Patent Office, Canada, and Japan, to the extent we deem appropriate. We have built a portfolio of patents and applications covering our products, including their hardware design and methods of hemodiafiltration.
 
We believe that our patent strategy will provide a competitive advantage in our target markets, but our patents may not be broad enough to cover our competitors’ products and may be subject to invalidation claims. Our U.S. patents for the “Method and Apparatus for Efficient Hemodiafiltration” and for the “Dual-Stage Filtration Cartridge” have claims that cover the OLpūr MDHDF filter series and the method of hemodiafiltration employed in the operation of the products. Technological developments in ESRD therapy could reduce the value of our intellectual property. Any such reduction could be rapid and unanticipated. We have issued patents on our water filtration products and applications in process to cover various applications in residential, commercial, and remote environments.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had four U.S. patents, one Canadian patent, one Chinese patent, one French patent, one German patent, one Italian patent, one United Kingdom patent, and one European patent. In addition, we have one pending patent application in the United States. Our pending US patent application relates to filter technologies, including liquid purification filter systems that are particularly suited for use in harsh environments.
 
Trademarks
 
As of December 31, 2022, in the United States, we secured registrations of the trademarks AETHER, ENDOPUR, HYDRAGUARD, and NANOGUARD. In the US, we filed trademark application for NEPHROS and BECAUSE WATER MATTERS. In the UK, we secured registrations for the trademark H2H, NANOGUARD, NEPHROS HYDRAGUARD, OLPUR, and PATHOGUARD.

Governmental Regulation
 
The research and development, manufacturing, promotion, marketing, and distribution of our ESRD therapy products in the United States, Europe and other regions of the world are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, including the FDA, the European Union and analogous agencies.
United States
 
The FDA regulates the manufacture and distribution of medical devices in the United States pursuant to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics (FDC) Act. All of our ESRD therapy products are regulated in the United States as medical devices by the FDA under the FDC Act. Under the FDC Act, medical devices are classified in one of three classes, namely Class I, II or III, on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness.

● | Class I devices are medical devices for which general controls are deemed sufficient to ensure their safety and effectiveness. General controls include provisions related to (1) labeling, (2) producer registration, (3) defect notification, (4) records and reports and (5) quality service requirements (“QSR”). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Class II devices are medical devices for which the general controls for the Class I devices are deemed not sufficient to ensure their safety and effectiveness and require special controls in addition to the general controls. Special controls include provisions related to (1) performance and design standards, (2) post-market surveillance, (3) patient registries and (4) the use of FDA guidelines. 
● | Class III devices are the most regulated medical devices and are generally limited to devices that support or sustain human life or are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health or present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Pre-market approval by the FDA is the required process of scientific review to ensure the safety and effectiveness of Class III devices. 

 
Before a new medical device can be introduced to the market, Section 510(k), and Section 515 of the FDC Act require a manufacturer who intends to market a medical device to submit a premarket notification (Section 510(k)) or a request for premarket approval (Section 515), to the FDA.
 
A 510(k) clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed Class I or Class II medical device or to a Class III medical device for which the FDA has not called for premarket approval under Section 515. The 510(k) clearance process is generally faster and simpler than the premarket approval process.
 
Premarket approval (PMA) is the FDA’s process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury, or are new and present unknown safety or effectiveness issues or risks. PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA. To gain approval, the manufacturer must present adequate scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).
 
For any devices cleared through the 510(k) clearance process, modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require a new 510(k) clearance submission. Accordingly, if we do obtain Section 510(k) clearance for any of our ESRD therapy and/or filtration products, we will need to submit another Section 510(k) notification if we significantly affect that product’s safety or effectiveness through subsequent modifications or enhancements.

All of our products have been cleared by the FDA as Class II devices, such as:
 

● | DSU Dual Stage UltraFilter: In June 2009, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the DSU to be used to filter biological contaminants from water and bicarbonate concentrate used in hemodialysis procedures. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | SSU-D/DSU-D Dual Stage UltraFilter: In July 2011, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the SSU/DSU to be used to filter water or bicarbonate concentrate used in hemodialysis procedures. 
● | OLpūr H2H Module and OLpūr MD 220 Hemodiafilter: In April 2012, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the OLpūr H2H Module and OLpūr MD 220 Hemodiafilter for use with a UF controlled hemodialysis machine that provides ultrapure dialysate in accordance with current ANSI/AAMI/ISO standards, for the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure in the United States. 
● | DSU-H/SSU-H: In October 2014, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the DSU-H and SSU-H ultrafilters to be used to filter EPA quality drinking water. The filters retain bacteria, viruses, and endotoxin. By providing ultrapure water for patient washing and drinking, the filters aid in infection control. 
● | S100 Point of Use Filter: In April 2016, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the S100 point-of-use filter to be used to filter EPA quality drinking water. The filters retain bacteria. By retaining bacteria in water for washing and drinking, the filter may aid in infection control. 
● | HydraGuard: In December 2016, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the HydraGuard 10” ultrafilter intended to be used to filter EPA quality drinking water. The filter retains bacteria, viruses and endotoxin. By providing ultrapure water for patient washing and drinking, the filter aids in infection control. 
● | EndoPur: In March 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the EndoPur ultrafilter intended to be used to filter water used in hemodialysis devices. It assists in providing hemodialysis quality water. The device is not a complete water treatment system but serves to remove biological contaminants. Therefore, it must be used in conjunction with other water treatment equipment (Reverse Osmosis, Deionization, etc.). 

 
The FDC Act requires that medical devices be manufactured in accordance with the FDA’s current QSR regulations which require, among other things, that:
 

● | the design and manufacturing processes be regulated and controlled by the use of written procedures; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the ability to produce medical devices which meet the manufacturer’s specifications be validated by extensive and detailed testing of every aspect of the process; 
● | any deficiencies in the manufacturing process or in the products produced be investigated; 
● | detailed records be kept, and a corrective and preventative action plan be in place; and 
● | manufacturing facilities be subject to FDA inspection on a periodic basis to monitor compliance with QSR regulations. 

 
In addition to the requirements described above, the FDC Act requires that:
 

● | all medical device manufacturers and distributors register with the FDA annually and provide the FDA with a list of those medical devices which they distribute commercially; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | information be provided to the FDA on death or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of the products, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and 


12
--


● | certain medical devices not cleared with the FDA for marketing in the United States meet specific requirements before they are exported. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We and our contract manufacturers are required to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers, or regulated suppliers, are not in compliance with these requirements, there may be a material adverse effect on our manufacturing operations, effecting our ability to sell.

The European Union began to harmonize national regulations comprehensively for the control of medical devices in member nations in 1993, when it adopted its Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC. The European Union directive applies to both the manufacturer’s quality assurance system and the product’s technical design and discusses the various ways to obtain approval of a device (dependent on device classification), how to properly CE mark a device, and how to place a device on the market.
 
In 2017, the European Union (EU) adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (Council Regulations 2017/745) which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including new quality system and post-market surveillance requirements.
 
As defined in EU Medical Device Regulation (Council Regulations 2017/745), the regulatory approach necessary to demonstrate to the European Union that the organization has the ability to provide medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer requirements and regulatory requirements applicable to medical devices requires the certification of a full quality management system by a notified body.
 
European Union requirements for products are set forth in harmonized European Union standards and include conformity to safety requirements, physical and biological properties, construction and environmental properties, and information supplied by the manufacturer. A company demonstrates conformity to these requirements, with respect to a product, by pre-clinical tests, biocompatibility tests, qualification of products and packaging, risk analysis and well-conducted clinical investigations approved by ethics committees.
 
Once a manufacturer’s full quality management system is determined to be in compliance with ISO 13485/2016 and other statutory requirements, and the manufacturer’s products conform to harmonized European standards, the notified body will recommend and document such conformity. The manufacturer will receive a CE marking and ISO certifications, and then may place a CE mark on the relevant products. The CE mark, which stands for Conformité Européene, demonstrates compliance with the relevant European Union requirements. Products subject to these provisions that do not bear the CE mark cannot be imported to, or sold or distributed within, the European Union.
 
Medical Devices sold in Europe/ anticipated to be sold in Europe, shall be examined, and classified as:
 

● | Class I: Provided non-sterile or do not have a measuring function; Low Risk 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Class I: Provided sterile and/or have a measuring function; Low/medium risk 
● | Class IIa: Medium risk 
● | Class IIb: Medium/high risk 
● | Class III: High risk

Currently we are in the process to seek approval for CE certification under EU Medical Device Regulation (Council Regulations 2017/745). Once approved, the following products will have certification from BSI America for CE marking and adherence to ISO13485 standards as Class IIa (Rule 3) medical devices:
 

● | SSU-D/DSU-D/SSUmini Ultrafilters: Intended to be used to filter water or bicarbonate concentrate used in hemodialysis procedures.

Regulatory Authorities in Regions Outside of the United States and the European Union
 
In November 2007 and May 2011, the Therapeutic Products Directorate of Health Canada, the Canadian health regulatory agency, approved our OLpūr MD220 Hemodiafilter and our DSU, respectively, for marketing in Canada. Other than the Canadian approval of our OLpūr MD220 Hemodiafilter and DSU products, we have not obtained any regulatory approvals to sell any of our products outside of the United States and the European Union and there is no assurance that any such clearance or certification will be issued.
 
Requirements pertaining to medical devices vary widely from country to country, ranging from no health regulations to detailed submissions such as those required by the FDA. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to audits and have been certified to be ISO 13485:2016, which allows us to sell our products in the United States and Canada.
 
In November 2020, we received MDSAP certification, to continue sales and compliance in the United States and Health Canada. The Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) is a program that allows the conduct of a single regulatory audit of a medical device manufacturer’s quality management system that satisfies the requirements of multiple regulatory jurisdictions. Audits are conducted by Auditing Organizations authorized by the participating Regulatory Authorities to audit under MDSAP requirements. The MDSAP is a way that medical device manufacturers can be audited once for compliance with the standard and regulatory requirements of up to five different medical device markets: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, and the United States.
 
Currently, we are in the process of expanding our MDSAP certification to include Brazil. Following the expansion of our MDSAP certificate, we will be allowed to sell our products in the United States, Canada, Brazil, and other territories around the world, while maintaining our current approvals. The time and cost of obtaining new, and maintaining existing, market authorizations from countries outside of North America, and the requirements for licensing products in these countries may differ significantly from FDA and/or MDR (European Union) requirements.
 
Product Liability and Insurance
 
The production, marketing and sale of our products have an inherent risk of liability in the event of product failure or claim of harm caused by product operation. We have acquired product liability insurance for our products in the amount of $3 million. A successful claim in excess of our insurance coverage could materially deplete our assets. Moreover, any claim against us could generate negative publicity, which could decrease the demand for our products, our ability to generate revenues and our profitability.
 
Some of our existing and potential agreements with manufacturers of our products and components of our products do or may require us (1) to obtain product liability insurance or (2) to indemnify manufacturers against liabilities resulting from the sale of our products. If we are not able to maintain adequate product liability insurance, we will be in breach of these agreements, which could materially adversely affect our ability to produce our products. Even if we are able to obtain and maintain product liability insurance, if a successful claim in excess of our insurance coverage is made, then we may have to indemnify some or all of our manufacturers for their losses, which could materially deplete our assets.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed a total of 27 full-time employees, including 9 employed in sales/marketing/customer support, 14 in logistics, general, and administrative, and 4 in research and development. None of our employees are currently represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. During 2022, we laid-off 7 employees (approximately 15% of our staff), and experienced limited voluntary turnover. Going forward, we intend to focus on maintaining our current good relations with our employees and continuing to develop and explore ways to collaborate with our employees and create a well-regarded workplace.
