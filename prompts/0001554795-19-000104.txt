Item 1. Description of Business
ORGANIZATION
 
Ozop Surgical Corp. (the” Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was originally incorporated as Newmarkt Corp. on July 17, 2015, under the laws of the State of Nevada, for the purpose of renting different kind of Segways and bicycles, dual wheels self-balancing electric scooters and related safety equipment. Following the acquisition of OZOP Surgical, Inc. as discussed below, we have been engaged in the business of inventing, designing, developing, manufacturing and distributing innovative endoscopic instruments, surgical implants, instrumentation, devices and related technologies, focused on spine, neurological and pain management procedures and specialties.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company has 290,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock authorized and there are 29,068,202 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, and 10,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value preferred stock and there were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.

Reverse Merger
 
On April 13, 2018, we entered into and completed a share exchange agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement") with OZOP Surgical, Inc. (“OZOP”), the shareholders of OZOP (the “OZOP Shareholders”) and Denis Razvodovskij, the then holder of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the OZOP Shareholders transferred and exchanged 100% of the capital stock of OZOP in exchange for an aggregate of 25,000,000 newly issued shares of our common stock (the “Share Exchange”). After giving effect to the redemption of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Redemption Agreement discussed below and the issuance of 25,000,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we had 25,797,500 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, with the OZOP Shareholders, as a group, owning 96.9% of such shares. Currently, our executive officers and directors, as a group, own 6,374,223 of our shares representing 21.57% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The merger was accounted for as a reverse merger, whereby OZOP was considered the accounting acquirer and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In accordance with the accounting treatment for a “reverse merger” or a “reverse acquisition,” the Company’s historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger were and will be replaced with the historical financial statements of OZOP prior to the reverse merger, in all future filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
 
In connection with the acquisition of OZOP, we purchased and redeemed 2,000,000 shares of our common stock from Mr. Razvodovskij for a total purchase price of $350,000 pursuant to a Share Redemption Agreement (the “Redemption Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, effective April 13, 2018, Mr. Razvodovskij resigned as the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, and sole director, and Michael Chermak, Salman J. Chaudhry (who has since resigned on March 4, 2019) and Eric Siu (who has since resigned on March 5, 2019) were named as directors of the Company.
 
On May 8, 2018, we amended our Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) to change our name from Newmarkt Corp. to Ozop Surgical Corp. in order to reflect more accurately the name of our core service offering and operations. The Amendment also increased our authorized shares of capital stock to 300,000,000, of which 290,000,000 has been designated as common stock, par value $0.001, and 10,000,000 shares have been designated as preferred stock, par value $0.001 (the “Preferred Stock”). The Preferred Stock shall be issuable in such series, and with such designations, rights and preferences as the Board of Directors may determine from time to time.
 
Series B Preferred 
 
On March 27, 2019, the Company filed a certificate of designation, preferences and rights of Series B preferred stock (the “Certificate”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to designate 1,000,000 shares of our previously authorized preferred stock as Series B preferred stock (the “Series B Preferred”). The Certificate and its filing was approved by our board of directors on March 27, 2019, without shareholder approval as provided for in our articles of incorporation and under Nevada law.

The Series B Preferred is not convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock or into any other shares of stock of the Company. The Series B Preferred shall have 50 votes per share on any matter submitted to the holders of the common stock, of the Company, or any class thereof, for a vote, and shall vote together with the common stock, or any class thereof, as applicable, on such matter for as long as the share of Series B Preferred is issued and outstanding, provided, however, that such number of votes shall be equitably adjusted for any forward or reverse splits of the common stock. The Series B Preferred will not be entitled to receive dividends. The Series B Preferred will not have any preferences upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntarily or involuntarily, a merger or consolidation of the Company wherein the Company is not the surviving entity, or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Series B Preferred shall not be entitled to receive any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the Company.
 
The Series B Preferred shall not participate in any distributions or payments to the holders of the common stock or in any distributions to any other classes of preferred stock of the Company. Further, the Company may not, and shall not, amend the Certificate without the prior written consent of holders of the Series B Preferred holding a majority of the Series B Preferred then issued and outstanding.
 
On March 29, 2019, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred to Michael Chermak, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and a member of its board of directors, in exchange for Mr. Chermak agreeing to forego $25,000 in accrued compensation from the Company.
 
OZOP
 
OZOP was originally incorporated in Switzerland on November 28, 1998 under the name Perma Consultants Holding AG (“Perma”). On July 19, 2016, Mr. Eric Siu (“Siu”), one of our former directors purchased 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Perma and changed the name from Perma to Ozop Surgical AG (“Ozop AG”). On February 1, 2018, Ozop AG was re-domiciled as a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Ozop Surgical, Inc. On July 28, 2016, OZOP formed as the sole member, Ozop Surgical, LLC (“Ozop LLC”), a Wyoming limited liability company. On October 28, 2016, OZOP acquired 100% of Ozop Surgical Limited (“Ozop HK”), from Siu, the sole shareholder of Ozop HK. Ozop HK, is a private limited company incorporated in Hong Kong.
 
On February 16, 2018, OZOP acquired the 100% membership interest (the “Membership Interest”) in Spinus, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Spinus”), from RWO Medical Consulting LLC (“RWO”), a Texas limited liability company (the “Acquisition”). OZOP purchased the Membership Interest from RWO in exchange for; (i) 5,000,000 shares OZOP’s common stock and ii) the assumption of all liabilities of Spinus, including an obligation of $250,000 pursuant to a license agreement by and between Spinus and a third party (the “Assumed Debt”). The Assumed Debt is secured by Spinus’s assets and was due the earlier of (i) February 16, 2019 or (ii) 15 days subsequent to the Company completing a minimum of a $3,000,000 equity raise. OZOP acquired Spinus to gain control of a license rights agreement for exclusive rights to intellectual property related to minimally invasive spine surgery techniques. The Assumed Debt of $250,000 was paid in November 2018.

Sales and marketing
 
OZOP’s sales and marketing strategy is based on our market experience and an extensive network of personal relationships built over the careers of our founders and officers. These relationships include surgeons, institutional buyers, and a vast network of surgical product distributors throughout the US. The Company plans to sponsor ‘hands on’ clinical workshops for surgeons in the US to train practitioners in the new techniques and products. The overriding objective of this business approach is to generate steadily increasing revenue and build a customer base that will embrace the Company’s current and future products. This has the two-fold benefit of lowering the company’s capital requirements and decreasing new product adoption curve. It is important to note that the customers of the current product offering are the same buyers that we hope will adopt future products. The same physician customers and distribution partners are all prospects for the new products in development. In fact, in many cases, OZOP plans to use the attraction of early access to these new products as an inducement to secure their immediate business.
 
We primarily plan to sell our products to hospitals and surgical facilities by (i) employees and contracted sales representatives, and (ii) commission-paid distributors. Our representatives and commission-paid distributors use their business contacts to expand and establish relationships to build our target medical facility customer base. We also plan to execute and maintain stocking distribution agreements providing distributors exclusive or non- exclusive distribution rights in certain geographic areas for the sale and promotion of the products we offer. We believe our IP and exclusive distribution agreements can provide us with important competitive advantages by increasing our brand awareness and ensuring that we use the latest design and manufacturing technology for our products that are perceived to be important to our customers.
 
We plan to develop and expand our customer portfolio by building relationships with key medical professionals. We will provide on-going product training and support to our sales representatives and independent contractors along with product marketing materials to ensure customer satisfaction with the products we offer. We believe focusing on these key areas is essential to growing our customer base and revenues.
 
We have significant concentration in and dependence on a small number of customers. In 2018, two (2) customers represented one hundred percent (100%) of our consolidated net revenues. If we lose either customer relationship, without replacing them, it could adversely impact our business, future operating results, and financial condition.
 
Manufacturing
 
We contract primarily with small and medium-sized manufacturers that are subject to FDA compliance and approval standards. These manufacturers are highly innovative and cost effective because of their streamlined sales infrastructures. All of our manufacturing partners will be qualified to manufacture under the FDA’s Quality System Regulations/ISO 13485 standards. The Company intends to retain in-house the quality assurance function so that we can approve all products prior to their release to market. We also intend to utilize high quality software in an effort to assure that our products remain compliant throughout all operations. The Company believes that there are no significant issues with availability of needed materials that would prevent us from meeting the projected market demand for our initial products in a timely manner. Packaging design and manufacturing will be outsourced to one or more experienced medical device packaging companies. The Company believes that this will allow for accelerated time to market and optimizing the shelf life of those products that are pre-packaged sterile.
Competition
 
The global spinal surgery market is characterized by strong competition. The worldwide spinal implant market currently includes over 220 manufacturers, but not all active competitors offer interbody spinal fusion devices in the United States. According to the 2018 Orthoworld, Inc., Orthopedic Industry Annual Report, the top ten companies account for approximately 80% of the overall market. The FDA's reclassification of spinal fusion devices from Class III to Class II in 2007 has attracted, and will continue to attract, new entrants in the market. The Company has recently seen a series of product launches and an increased focus on research and development activities, and it anticipates that intense competition between the new entrants and existing companies may lead to pricing pressure on all companies in the future.
 
According to the Orthoworld report, Medtronic Inc. dominates the global market for spinal surgery devices, with a market share of approximately 27%. The Company believes that this is due, in large part, to its broad portfolio of spinal fusion devices. DePuy Synthes ranks second at 16%. Other leading players with market shares of approximately 10% and 8%, respectively include NuVasive Inc. and Stryker Corporation.

We believe the competition in our industry is primarily caused by continued mergers and acquisitions of smaller companies by larger, vertically-integrated companies that produce, market and distribute medical devices and surgical implants. Our vertically-integrated competitors benefit from their ability to control costs for the devices they manufacture and distribute. Moreover, the market in which we operate is sensitive to changes in third-party and government reimbursements and, to a lesser degree, competitive discount pricing. We believe that our industry will continue to see increased mergers and acquisitions because the market is significantly fragmented with numerous medical device distributors and specialized suppliers offering similar product portfolios throughout the United States.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own and license an expansive and formidable intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio. On February 1, 2018, Spinus entered into an Intellectual Property Licensing Agreement (the “Licensing Agreement”). Pursuant to the Spinus acquisition, the Company assumed the obligations under the Licensing Agreement and pledged the assets of Spinus as security. In consideration of $250,000 Spinus has the exclusive rights to certain patents and the non-exclusive rights to other patents. The patents surround mechanical or inflatable expandable interbody implant products. The $250,000 was due the earlier of (i) February 16, 2019 or (ii) 15 days subsequent to the Company completing a minimum of a $3,000,000 equity raise. The Company paid the $250,000 on November 20, 2018. The Company also will pay a royalty of 7% of net sales on any product sold utilizing any of the patents. There have not been any sales of the licensed products and accordingly, no royalties have been incurred.
 
The Company is in the process of expanding this portfolio and developing and bringing these products/procedures to market. Some of these products have short pathways to US regulatory approval, while others require a more resource intensive effort. We plan to pursue additional strategic alliances and partnerships through IP license agreements, and secure agreements from engineering firms and suppliers to build upon and to bring to market our portfolio of IP products.
 
Regulatory Issues
 
Our business is subject to highly complex United States federal and state regulations that may impact our ability to fully implement our strategic plans and initiatives. We are required to obtain and hold licenses and permits and to comply with the regulatory requirements of various governmental agencies. If we fail to comply with such regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply with such regulations, the economic viability of our Company may be adversely affected.
 
FDA Regulations
 
The manufacturers and suppliers of the products we market are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, other federal governmental agencies, and state authorities. These laws and regulations govern the approval of, clearance of, or license to commercialize medical devices (such as implants). This includes compliance with the standards and requirements related to the design, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, and sales of the products, record keeping requirements, tracking of devices, reporting of potential product defects and adverse events, conduct of corrections, and recalls and other matters. As a distributor, marketer and repackager/relabeler of such FDA-regulated products, we are subject to independent requirements to register and list certain products. We may be required to obtain state licensure or certifications and we may be subject to inspections, in addition to complying with requirements that apply to the manufacturers of the products we market. Failure to comply with those applicable requirements could result in a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from warning letters to more severe sanctions such as fines, civil penalties, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecutions.
 
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
We are required to comply with federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. Such healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to the relationships that we or our distributors have with healthcare professionals and entities, such as physicians and hospitals. U.S. federal health care laws including laws related to false claims, health care fraud and abuse, physician self-referrals, and anti-kickbacks apply when we or our customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally-funded health care programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid). State health care laws of a similar nature apply to state-funded health care programs and may also apply with private third-party payors. The requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to federal or state government investigations, substantial fines, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, and civil or criminal sanctions. Such sanctions and damages could adversely affect the economic viability of our Company.

Other than our officers and directors, we currently do not have any employees. We plan on adding support staff for sales, marketing, distribution and administrative services in the second quarter of 2019.
