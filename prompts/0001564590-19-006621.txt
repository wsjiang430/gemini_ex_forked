Overview and Strategy
 XOMA Corporation (“XOMA”), a Delaware corporation, is a biotech enterprise with an extensive history of discovering and developing innovative therapeutic candidates derived from its unique platform of antibody technologies. In March 2017, we transformed our business model to become a royalty aggregator where we focus on expanding our programs in which we own a right to receive future milestone and royalty payments. These programs and related milestone and royalty interests come from drug candidates discovered by our licensees and partners from their use of our proprietary antibody discovery platform and from product candidates we discovered from that same platform, and advanced prior to out-licensing. In all cases, the licensees have assumed the responsibility for subsequent development, regulatory approval and commercialization. When we transitioned to the royalty-aggregator model we significantly reduced corporate infrastructure in order to minimize the cash burn associated with the period until we expect to experience revenue inflow from these potential milestones and royalties. We expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will be based on payments we may receive for milestones and royalties related to these programs. 
  Our strategy has a two-part approach to building value.  The first component of the strategy is to allow our current pipeline of product candidates to advance over time from the investments made by our licensees.  We built this pipeline by out-licensing our technology platform and our drug candidate products to licensees or collaborator partners who assumed the responsibilities of later stage development, regulatory approval and commercialization. We refer to these programs as “fully funded” since our partners pay the development and commercialization costs. As licensees advance these programs, we are eligible for potential milestone and royalty payments. Fundamental to this component is our focus on maintaining an efficient and low corporate cost structure for the reasons outlined above.  
 1


The second component of our strategy is to expand our pipeline by acquiring potential milestone and royalty revenue streams on additional drug product candidates from third parties.  Expanding our pipeline through these acquisitions can allow for further diversification across therapeutic areas and development stages.  Our ideal target acquisitions are in pre-commercial stages of development, have an expected long duration of market exclusivity, high revenue potential, and are partnered with a large pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical enterprise.  In September of 2018, we closed our first acquisition and added seven new programs to our fully-funded asset pipeline by acquiring a partial interest position in the rights to potential milestone and royalty payments associated with immuno-oncology antibodies currently being developed by Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (“Merck”) and Incyte Europe Sarl (“Incyte”) under collaboration agreements with Agenus, Inc. and certain affiliates (collectively “Agenus”).
 The following charts demonstrate the diversification of our fully-funded asset pipeline across therapeutic areas and development stages. 
 

Selected Programs Underlying Our Core Pipeline
 Historically, we have licensed or provided research and development collaboration services to world-class organizations, such as Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”) in pursuit of new antibody products under which we are eligible to receive potential future milestone payments and royalties. The following is a summary of material license and collaboration agreements that represent a significant component of our core pipeline. 
Novartis – Anti-CD40 Antibody 
 In September 2015, we and Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc. (“NVDI”), further amended our 2008 Amended and Restated Research, Development and Commercialization Agreement, relating to anti-CD40 antibodies. Under this agreement, NVDI is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of the antibodies and products containing the antibodies arising from this program. The parties agreed to reduce the royalty rates that we are eligible to receive on sales of NVDI’s clinical stage anti-CD40 antibodies (“CFZ533”). These royalties are tiered based on sales levels and now range from a mid-single digit percentage rate to a low double-digit percentage rate.
  Our right to royalty payments expires on the later of the expiration of any licensed patent covering each product or 10 years from the first commercial sale of each product.  Novartis is conducting early clinical testing of CFZ533 in several indications.
 Novartis – Gevokizumab and IL-1
 In August 2017, we and Novartis entered into multiple license agreements. Under the first license agreement (the “XOMA-052 License Agreement”), we granted Novartis an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to gevokizumab (“VPM087”) (an early clinical stage product candidate) and related know-how and patents. Under the terms of the XOMA-052 License Agreement, Novartis will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of VPM087 and products containing such antibody. 
 2


Under the XOMA-052 License Agreement, we received total consideration of $30.0 million in 2017 for the license and rights granted to Novartis. Of the total consideration, $15.7 million was paid in cash and $14.3 million (equal to €12.0 million) was paid by Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Inc. (“NIBR”), on our behalf, to settle our loan with Les Laboratories Servier (“Servier”). In addition, NIBR extended the maturity date on our debt to Novartis to September 30, 2022. We also received $5.0 million related to the sale of 539,131 shares of our common stock, at a price per share of $9.2742. Based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria, we are eligible to receive up to $438.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We are also eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and range from a high single digit percentage rate to a low double-digit percentage rate. This program is in early clinical testing.
 Under the second license agreement (the “IL-1 Target License Agreement”), we granted Novartis non-exclusive licenses to our intellectual property covering the use of IL-1 beta targeting antibodies in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease and other diseases and conditions, and an option to obtain an exclusive license (the “Exclusivity Option”) to such intellectual property for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. We also granted Novartis the right of first negotiation with respect to certain transactions relating to the licensed intellectual property.  
 Under the IL-1 Target License Agreement, we received an upfront cash payment of $10.0 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive low single-digit royalties on canakinumab sales in cardiovascular indications. 
 In October 2018, Novartis disclosed that it received a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regarding the supplemental Biologics License Application for cardiovascular risk reduction related to canakinumab. In December 2018, Novartis withdrew the European marketing application for canakinumab for cardiovascular risk reduction.
 Unless terminated earlier, the XOMA-052 License Agreement and IL-1 Target License Agreement will remain in effect, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, until Novartis’ royalty obligations end. The two agreements contain customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Novartis also has a unilateral right to terminate the XOMA-052 License Agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis or in its entirety on six months’ prior written notice. Under the IL-1 Target License Agreement, Novartis has a unilateral right to terminate the agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis or in its entirety upon a prior written notice.
 Novartis – Anti-TGFβ Antibody
 In September 2015, we and Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd. (“Novartis International”) entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement”) under which we granted Novartis International an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to our anti-TGF-β antibody program (“NIS793”). Novartis International is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of the antibodies and products containing the antibodies arising from this program. 
 Under the License Agreement, we received a $37.0 million upfront fee, and are eligible to receive up to a total of $480.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We also are eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and range from a mid-single digit percentage rate to a low double-digit percentage rate. This program is currently in early clinical testing.
 Rezolute 
 On December 6, 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Rezolute, Inc. (formerly AntriaBio, Inc.) (“Rezolute”) pursuant to which we granted an exclusive global license to Rezolute to develop and commercialize X358 (now RZ358), a Phase 2 product candidate, for all indications. We and Rezolute also entered into a common stock purchase agreement.
 Under the terms of the license agreement, Rezolute is responsible for all development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities associated with RZ358 and is required to make certain clinical, regulatory and annual net sales milestone payments to us of up to $232.0 million in the aggregate based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria. Rezolute is also obligated to pay us royalties ranging from the high single digits to the mid-teens based upon annual net sales of RZ358. Rezolute is obligated to take customary steps to advance RZ358, including using diligent efforts to commence the next clinical study for RZ358 by a certain deadline and to meet certain spending requirements on an annual basis for the program until a marketing approval application for RZ358 is accepted by the FDA. Rezolute’s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular RZ358 product and country will continue for the longer of the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the product in that country, or twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country. 
 3


Under the terms of the license agreement, Rezolute is required to pay us a low single-digit royalty on sales of Rezolute’s other products from its existing programs, currently in preclinical and early clinical stages. Rezolute’s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular Rezolute product and country will continue for the longer of twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country or for so long as Rezolute or its licensee is selling such product in such country, provided that such royalty will terminate upon the termination of the licensee’s obligation to make payments to Rezolute based on sales of such product in such country.
We also granted Rezolute an option through June 1, 2019 for an exclusive license for their choice of one of our preclinical insulin receptor monoclonal antibody fragments, including X129. If Rezolute exercises the option, we will be eligible for an upfront option fee and additional clinical, regulatory and annual net sales milestone payments to us of up to $237.0 million in the aggregate based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria as well as royalties ranging from a high single digit percentage rate to a low double-digit percentage rate based on annual net sales. The license agreement contains customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Rezolute also has a unilateral right to terminate the license agreement in its entirety on ninety-days’ notice at any time. We have the right to terminate the license agreement if Rezolute challenges the licensed patents.
 In March 2018, we and Rezolute amended the license agreement and common stock purchase agreement. Pursuant to the as-amended terms of the license agreement and common stock purchase agreement, Rezolute is required to pay us $6.0 million in cash, to issue us $8.5 million worth of its common stock, and to issue us 7,000,000 shares of its common stock, contingent on the completion of its financing activities. Further, in the event that Rezolute does not complete a financing that raises at least $20.0 million in aggregate gross proceeds (“Qualified Financing”) by March 31, 2019 (the “2019 Closing”), it shall issue to us an additional number of shares of its common stock equal to $8.5 million divided by the weighted average of the closing bid and ask prices or the average closing prices of Rezolute’s common stock on the ten-day trading period prior to March 31, 2019. Finally, if Rezolute is unable to complete a Qualified Financing by March 31, 2020, it will be obliged to pay us $15.0 million in order to maintain the license. Under the common stock purchase agreement, Rezolute granted us the right and option to sell the greater of (i) 5,000,000 shares of common stock or (ii) one third of the aggregate shares held by us upon failure by Rezolute to list its shares of its common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market or a similar national exchange on or prior to December 31, 2018.
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, Rezolute closed a debt financing activity for gross proceeds of $4.0 million, which triggered the Initial Closing, and completed an Interim Financing Closing, as defined in the common stock purchase agreement. These financing activities resulted in receipt of 8,093,010 shares of Rezolute’s common stock and cash of $0.5 million. Under the amended license agreement, we are also entitled to receive $0.3 million of reimbursable technology transfer expenses from Rezolute. On January 7, 2019, we and Rezolute further amended the license agreement and common stock purchase agreement. The license agreement was amended to eliminate the requirement that equity securities be issued to us upon the closing of the Qualified Financing (as defined in the license agreement) and to replace it with a requirement that Rezolute: (1) make five cash payments to us totaling $8.5 million following the closing of a Qualified Financing on or before specified staggered future dates through September 2020 (the “Future Cash Payments”); and (2) provide for early payment of the Future Cash Payments (only until the above referenced $8.5 million is reached) by making cash payments to us equal to 15% of the net proceeds of each future financing following the closing of the Qualified Financing, with such payments to be credited against any remaining unpaid Future Cash Payments in reverse order of their future payment date. In accordance with the terms of the license agreement, we received additional $5.5 million in cash upon the closing of the Qualified Financing.
 In addition, the license agreement amendment revised the amount Rezolute is required to expend on development of RZ358 and related licensed products and revised provisions with respect to Rezolute’s diligence efforts in conducting clinical studies. Lastly, the common stock purchase agreement was amended to remove certain provisions related to the issuance of equity to us in accordance with the new provisions regarding the Future Cash Payments in the license agreement. Specifically, the common stock purchase agreement was amended to provide XOMA the right to sell up to 5,000,000 shares of Rezolute common stock currently held by us, back to Rezolute if it fails to list its shares of common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market or a similar national exchange on or prior to December 31, 2019.  Only 2,500,000 shares may be sold back to Rezolute during calendar year 2020.  Any such shares may be sold back to Rezolute at the average of the closing bid and asked prices of its common stock quoted on its principal trading market on the date of such put option exercise.
  Takeda
 In November 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda under which we agreed to discover and optimize therapeutic antibodies against multiple targets selected by Takeda.
 Under the terms of this agreement, we may receive additional milestone payments aggregating up to $19.0 million relating to one undisclosed product candidate and low single-digit royalties on future sales of all products subject to this license. Our right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with respect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets or 
 4


collaboration products. Our right to royalties expires on the later of 13.5 years from the first commercial sale of each royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent.
 In February 2009, we expanded our existing collaboration to provide Takeda with access to multiple antibody technologies, including a suite of research and development technologies and integrated information and data management systems. We may receive milestones of up to $3.3 million per discovery product candidate and low single-digit royalties on future sales of all antibody products subject to this license. Our right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with respect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets or collaboration products. Our right to royalties expires on the later of 10 years from the first commercial sale of such royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent.
 Ology Bioservices 
 On November 4, 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Ology Bioservices, Inc. (“Ology Bioservices”) (formerly Nanotherapeutics Inc.) (the “Ology Bioservices Purchase Agreement”), under which Ology Bioservices agreed to acquire our biodefense business and related assets. Under the terms of this agreement, we are eligible to receive a 15% royalty on net sales of any future Ology Bioservices products covered by or involving the related patents or know-how. Further details of the Ology Bioservices Purchase Agreement are provided in the section below, “Sale of Biodefense Assets and Manufacturing Facility.”
Acquisitions
 Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement
 On September 20, 2018, we entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement (the “Royalty Purchase Agreement”) with Agenus. Under the Royalty Purchase Agreement, we purchased from Agenus the right to receive 33% of the future royalties due to Agenus from Incyte (net of certain royalties payable by Agenus to a third party) and 10% of all future developmental, regulatory and sales milestones on sales of six Incyte immuno-oncology assets, with the exception of an expected near-term milestone associated with the entry of INCAGN2390 (anti-TIM-3) into the clinical trial. In addition, we purchased from Agenus the right to receive 33% of the future royalties due to Agenus from Merck and 10% of all future developmental, regulatory and sales milestones on sales of an undisclosed Merck immuno-oncology product currently in clinical development. Pursuant to the Royalty Purchase Agreement, our share in future potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones is up to $59.5 million and the royalties have no limit. Under the terms of the Royalty Purchase Agreement, we paid Agenus $15.0 million. We have financed $7.5 million of the purchase price with a three-year term loan under our Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) dated May 7, 2018.  
Proprietary Product Candidates
 We have a pipeline of unique monoclonal antibodies and technologies that we intend to attempt to license to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to further their clinical development. A summary of these product candidates is provided below:

• | X213 (formerly LFA 102) is a first-in-class allosteric inhibitor of prolactin action. It is a humanized IgG1-Kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of the human prolactin receptor with high affinity at an allosteric site. The antibody has been shown to inhibit prolactin-mediated signaling, and it is potent and similarly active against several animal and human prolactin receptors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | XMetA is an insulin receptor-activating antibody designed to provide long-acting reduction of hyperglycemia in Type 2 diabetic patients, potentially reducing the advancement to a number of insulin injections needed to control their blood glucose levels.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IL-2 targets interleukin 2 and has long been recognized as an effective therapy for metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, but it has serious dose-limiting toxicities that prevent broad clinical use. We have generated novel antibodies that, when given with IL-2, are intended to steer IL-2 to enhance its positive impact with less toxicity, potentially improving the therapeutic index over standard IL-2 therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PTH1R is an anti-parathyroid receptor pipeline that includes several unique functional antibody antagonists targeting PTH1R, a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in the regulation of calcium metabolism. These antibodies have shown promising efficacy in in vivo studies and could potentially address unmet medical needs, including primary hyperparathyroidism and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (“HHM”). HHM is present in many advanced cancers and is caused by high serum calcium due to increased levels of the PTH1R ligand PTH-related peptide (“PTHrP”). Current HHM treatments often fall short and many cancer patients die from ‘metabolic death'. Our PTH1R antibodies could be beneficial for the treatment of HHM.

Technologies Available for Non-Exclusive License
 We have a unique set of antibody discovery, optimization and development technologies available for licensing, including:
  
• | ADAPT™ (Antibody Discovery Advanced Platform Technologies): proprietary human antibody phage display libraries, integrated with yeast and mammalian display, which can be integrated into antibody discovery programs through license agreements. We believe access to ADAPT™ Integrated Display offers a number of benefits because it enables the diversity of phage libraries to be combined with accelerated discovery due to rapid immunoglobulin (“IgG”) reformatting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting based screening using yeast and mammalian display. This increases the probability of success in finding rare and unique functional antibodies directed to targets of interest.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ModulX™: technology which allows modulation of biological pathways using monoclonal antibodies and offers insights into regulation of signaling pathways, homeostatic control, and disease biology. Using ModulX™, we have generated product candidates with novel mechanisms of action that specifically alter the kinetics of interaction between molecular constituents (e.g. receptor-ligand). ModulX™ technology enables expanded target and therapeutic options and offers a unique approach in the treatment of disease.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | OptimX™ technologies:
--+----------------------


• | Human Engineering™ (“HE™”): a proprietary humanization technology that allows modification of non-human monoclonal antibodies to reduce or eliminate detectable immunogenicity and make them suitable for medical purposes in humans. The technology uses a unique method developed by us, based on analysis of the conserved structure-function relationships among antibodies. The method defines which residues in a non-human variable region are candidates to be modified. The result is an HE™ antibody with preserved antigen binding, structure and function that has eliminated or greatly reduced immunogenicity. HE™ technology was used in development of gevokizumab (VPM087) and certain other antibody products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Targeted Affinity Enhancement™ (“TAE™”): a proprietary technology involving the assessment and guided substitution of amino acids in antibody variable regions, enabling efficient optimization of antibody binding affinity and selectivity. TAE™ generates a comprehensive map of the effects of amino acid mutations in the complementarity-determining region likely to impact binding. The technology has been licensed to a number of companies.

Sale of Biodefense Assets and Manufacturing Facility 
 Ology Bioservices
 On November 4, 2015, we entered the Ology Bioservices Purchase Agreement with Ology Bioservices, under which Ology Bioservices agreed to acquire our biodefense business and related assets (including certain contracts with the U.S. government), and to assume certain liabilities of XOMA. As part of that transaction, the parties, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, entered into an intellectual property license agreement (the “Ology Bioservices License Agreement”), under which we agreed to license to Ology Bioservices certain intellectual property rights related to the purchased assets. Under the Ology Bioservices License Agreement, we were eligible for up to $4.5 million of cash payments and 23,008 shares of common stock of Ology Bioservices, based upon Ology Bioservices achieving certain specified future operational objectives. In addition, we are eligible to receive a 15% royalty on net sales of any future Ology Bioservices products covered by or involving the related patents or know-how. Our right to royalties continues until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent.
 In February 2017, we executed an Amendment and Restatement to both the Ology Bioservices Purchase Agreement and Ology Bioservices License Agreement primarily to (i) remove the obligation to issue 23,008 shares of common stock of Ology Bioservices under the Ology Bioservices Purchase Agreement, and (ii) revise the payment schedule related to the timing of the $4.5 million cash payments due to us under the Ology Bioservices License Agreement. Of the $4.5 million, $3.0 million was contingent upon Ology Bioservices achieving certain specified future operating objectives. In the first quarter of 2017, we were entitled to receive $1.6 million under the agreement that was received in quarterly payments through September 2018. In the third quarter of 2017, Ology Bioservices achieved the specified operating objectives and we earned the $3.0 million milestone fee that was received in monthly payments through July 2018. Of the total $4.6 million owed to us, we received $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, and $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, which was recognized as other income in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. No further payments remain under the agreement, but we are still eligible to receive royalties in the future.

Sale of Future Revenue Streams 
 Royalty Acquisition Agreements
 On December 21, 2016, we entered into two Royalty Interest Acquisition Agreements (together, the “Royalty Acquisition Agreements”) with HealthCare Royalty Partners II, L.P. (“HCRP”). Under the first Royalty Acquisition Agreement, we sold our right to receive milestone payments and royalties on future sales of products subject to a license agreement, dated August 18, 2005, between XOMA and Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”) (formerly Wyeth) for an upfront cash payment of $6.5 million, plus potential additional payments totaling $4.0 million in the event three specified net sales milestones are met by Pfizer in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The 2017 sales milestone was not achieved. Based on estimated sales for 2018, the 2018 sales milestone was not achieved. We remain eligible to receive up to $2.0 million if specified net sales milestones are achieved in 2019. Under the second Royalty Acquisition Agreement entered into in December 2016, we sold all rights to royalties under an Amended and Restated License Agreement dated October 27, 2006 between XOMA and Shire Plc. (formerly Dyax, Corp.) for a cash payment of $11.5 million.
Debt Agreements
 Novartis
 In connection with the collaboration between XOMA and Novartis AG (then Chiron Corporation), a secured note agreement was executed in May 2005. The note agreement is secured by our interest in the collaboration and was due and payable in full on June 21, 2015. On June 19, 2015, we and NVDI, who assumed the note agreement, agreed to extend the maturity date of our secured note agreement from June 21, 2015 to September 30, 2015, which was then subsequently extended to September 30, 2020. On September 22, 2017, in connection with the XOMA-052 License Agreement with Novartis, we and NIBR, who assumed the note agreement from NVDI, executed an amendment to the note agreement under which we further extended the maturity date of the note to September 30, 2022. At December 31, 2018, the outstanding principal balance under this note agreement totaled $15.2 million. 
Silicon Valley Bank Loan Agreement
 In May 2018, we executed a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with SVB. Under the Loan Agreement, upon our request, SVB may make advances available to us of up to $20.0 million. We may borrow advances under the Term Loan from May 7, 2018 (the “Effective Date”) until the earlier of March 31, 2020 or an event of default. The interest rate will be calculated at a rate equal to the greater of (i) 4.75%, and (ii) 0.25% plus the prime rate as reported from time to time in The Wall Street Journal. 
 In connection with the Loan Agreement, we issued a warrant to SVB which is exercisable in whole or in part for up to an aggregate of 6,332 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $23.69 per share (the “Warrant”). The Warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis and is exercisable within 10 years from the date of issuance or upon the consummation of certain acquisitions of XOMA.
 In September 2018, we borrowed $7.5 million under the Loan Agreement in connection with the Agenus royalty purchase agreement.
 In March 2019, we issued a second warrant to SVB which is exercisable in whole or in part for up to an aggregate of 4,845 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $14.71 per share. The new warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis and is exercisable within 10 years from the date of issuance or upon the consummation of certain acquisitions of XOMA.
 Servier
 In December 2010, in connection with the collaboration agreement entered into with Servier, we executed a loan agreement with Servier (the “Servier Loan Agreement”), which provided for an advance of up to €15.0 million (or $19.5 million at the exchange rate on the date of funding). The loan was secured by an interest in XOMA’s intellectual property rights to all gevokizumab (VPM087) indications worldwide, excluding certain rights in the United States and Japan. 
 On August 25, 2017, NIBR settled the Servier Loan Agreement in cash by paying directly to Servier $14.3 million, which represented the outstanding balance of the loan based on a euro to dollar exchange rate of 1.1932. The funds that NIBR paid directly to Servier were a portion of the upfront payment due to us under the XOMA-052 License Agreement. As a result of the debt being fully paid, the intellectual property securing the Servier Loan Agreement was released.

Hercules Loan and Security Agreement
 In February 2015, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc., (the “Hercules Loan Agreement”) under which we borrowed $20.0 million. 
 On March 21, 2017, the Hercules Term Loan was paid in full and we were not required to pay the 1% prepayment charge due pursuant to the terms of the loan. 
Research and Development
 Our research and development expenses include costs of personnel, supplies, facilities and equipment, consultants, third-party costs and other expenses related to preclinical and clinical testing. 
 Prior to 2017, our research and development activities can be divided into those related to our internal projects and those related to collaborative and contract arrangements, which are reimbursed by our collaborators. In March 2017, we initiated a corporate reorganization to discontinue internal product development and terminated our clinical programs as of June 30, 2017, both of which significantly reduced our research and development expenses. 
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to continuous and substantial technological change. Some of the drugs our licensees are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors. There can be no assurance that developments by others will not render our, or our licensees’, products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive.
 Additionally, our recently-undertaken royalty aggregator model faces competition on at least two fronts. First, there are other companies, funds and other investment vehicles seeking to aggregate royalties or provide alternative financing to development-stage biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The competitive companies, funds and other investment vehicles may have a lower target rate of return, a lower cost of capital or access to greater amounts of capital and thereby may be able to acquire assets that we are also targeting for acquisitions. Second, existing or potential competitors to our partners’ and licensees’ products, particularly large pharmaceutical companies, may have greater financial, technical and human resources than our licensees. Accordingly, these competitors may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. Many of these companies also have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products.
 For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
 Government Regulation
 The research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. We and our partners and licensees, depending on specific activities performed, are subject to these regulations. In the United States, pharmaceuticals are subject to regulation by both federal and various state authorities, including the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level. There are similar regulations in other countries as well. For both currently marketed and products in development, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in delays, the suspension of regulatory approvals, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on us or our partners. 
 For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

 Intellectual property is important to our business and our future income streams will depend in part on our ability to obtain issued patents, and our partners’ and licensees’ ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We hold and have filed applications for a number of patents in the United States and internationally to protect our products and technology. We also have obtained or have the right to obtain licenses to, or income streams based on, certain patents and applications filed by others. However, the patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and consistent policy regarding the breadth of allowed claims has not emerged from the actions of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with respect to biotechnology patents. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our, or our partners’ or licensees’ patents will afford protection against competitors with similar products or others will not obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our, or our partners’ or licensees’ patent applications. Below is a list of our patents and patent applications related to our programs:

* Novartis-owned patent
 **Jointly-owned with Medical University of South Carolina Foundation for Research Development
 If certain patents issued to others are upheld or if certain patent applications filed by others are issued and upheld, our partners and licensees may require certain licenses from others to develop and commercialize certain potential products incorporating our technology. There can be no assurance that such licenses, if required, will be available on acceptable terms.
 We protect our proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and partners. These parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that we or our consultants or partners use intellectual property owned by others, we may have disputes with our consultants or partners or other third parties, as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Concentration of Risk
 Our business model is dependent on third parties achieving specified development milestones and product sales.  Our pipeline currently includes over 40 fully-funded programs from which we could potentially receive royalties if the programs achieve marketability.  Novartis is developing several of the programs in our pipeline.  While we do not expect the discontinuation of any one program would have a material impact on our business, the discontinuation of all programs by Novartis could have a material effect on our business and financial condition.
Organization
 We were incorporated in Delaware in 1981 and became a Bermuda-exempted company in December 1998. Effective December 31, 2011, we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Delaware and changed our name from XOMA Ltd. to XOMA Corporation.
