Item 1.    Business. 
The Company: The J. M. Smucker Company (“Company,” “registrant,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), often referred to as Smucker’s (a registered trademark), was established in 1897 and incorporated in Ohio in 1921. We operate principally in one industry, the manufacturing and marketing of branded food and beverage products on a worldwide basis, although the majority of our sales are in the U.S. Our operations outside the U.S. are principally in Canada, although products are exported to other countries as well. Net sales outside the U.S., subject to foreign currency translation, represented 5 percent of consolidated net sales for 2019. Our branded food and beverage products include a strong portfolio of trusted, iconic, market-leading brands that are sold to consumers through retail outlets in North America.
On May 14, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, LLC (“Ainsworth”), a leading producer, distributor, and marketer of premium pet food and pet snacks, predominantly within the U.S. The majority of Ainsworth’s sales are generated by the Rachael Ray® Nutrish® brand, which is driving significant growth in the premium pet food category. The all-cash transaction, which was funded with debt, was valued at $1.9 billion. For further information, refer to Note 2: Acquisition.
On August 31, 2018, we sold our U.S. baking business to Brynwood Partners VII L.P. and Brynwood Partners VIII L.P., subsidiaries of Brynwood Partners, an unrelated party. The transaction included products that were primarily sold in U.S. retail channels under the Pillsbury®, Martha White®, Hungry Jack®, White Lily®, and Jim Dandy® brands, along with all relevant trademarks and licensing agreements, and our manufacturing facility in Toledo, Ohio. This business generated net sales of approximately $370.0 million in 2018. The transaction did not include our baking business in Canada. For further information, refer to Note 4: Divestiture.
On March 23, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands (“Big Heart”), a leading producer, distributor, and marketer of premium, branded pet food and pet snacks in the U.S. The cash and stock transaction was valued at $5.9 billion, which included the issuance of 17.9 million shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Blue Acquisition Group, Inc., Big Heart’s parent company. We assumed $2.6 billion in debt that we repaid at closing and paid an additional $1.2 billion in cash. 
We have four reportable segments: U.S. Retail Coffee, U.S. Retail Consumer Foods, U.S. Retail Pet Foods, and International and Away From Home. The U.S. retail market segments in total comprised 86 percent of 2019 consolidated net sales and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food and beverage products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in North America. The International and Away From Home segment represents sales outside of the U.S. retail market segments.
Principal Products: Our principal products as of April 30, 2019, are coffee, dog food, pet snacks, cat food, peanut butter, fruit spreads, frozen handheld products, shortening and oils, portion control products, juices and beverages, and flour and baking ingredients. Product sales information for the years 2019, 2018, and 2017 is included within Note 5: Reportable Segments. 
In the U.S. retail market segments, our products are primarily sold through a combination of direct sales and brokers to food retailers, club stores, pet specialty stores, discount and dollar stores, food wholesalers, online retailers, drug stores, natural foods stores and distributors, military commissaries, and mass merchandisers. In the International and Away From Home segment, our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., restaurants, lodging, schools and universities, health care operators).
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials: The raw materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities and agricultural-based products. Green coffee, peanuts, animal protein meals, oils and fats, sweeteners, grains, fruit, and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers. The availability, quality, and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, over time. Basis, futures, options, and fixed price contracts are used to manage price volatility for a significant portion of our commodity costs. Green coffee, along with certain other raw materials, is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather, global supply and demand, plant disease, investor speculation, and political and economic conditions in the source countries. We source peanuts, animal protein meals, and oils and fats mainly from North America. The principal packaging materials we use are plastic, glass, metal cans, caps, carton board, and corrugate. For additional information on the commodities we 
2

purchase, see “Commodities Overview” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Raw materials are generally available from numerous sources, although we have elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single sources of supply pursuant to long-term contracts. While availability may vary year-to-year, we believe that we will continue to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to single-sourced materials are available. We have not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials. We consider our relationships with key raw material suppliers to be in good standing.
Trademarks and Patents: Our products are produced under certain patents and marketed under trademarks owned or licensed by us or one of our subsidiaries. Our major trademarks as of April 30, 2019, are listed below. 

Primary Reportable Segment | Major Trademark 
U.S. Retail Coffee | Folgers®, Dunkin’ Donuts®, and Café Bustelo® 
U.S. Retail Consumer Foods | Smucker’s®, Jif®, Uncrustables®, and Crisco® 
U.S. Retail Pet Foods | Rachael Ray Nutrish, Meow Mix®, Milk-Bone®, Natural Balance®, Kibbles ‘n Bits®, 9Lives®, Nature’s Recipe®, and Pup-Peroni®

Dunkin’ Donuts is a registered trademark of DD IP Holder LLC used under two licenses (the “Dunkin’ Licenses”) for packaged coffee products, including K-Cup® pods, sold in retail channels such as grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, and drug stores. The Dunkin’ Licenses do not pertain to Dunkin’ Donuts coffee or other products for sale in Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants. The terms of the Dunkin’ Licenses include the payment of royalties to an affiliate of DD IP Holder LLC and other financial commitments by the Company. The Dunkin’ Licenses are in effect until January 1, 2039.
We utilize Rachael Ray’s image and likeness and related Rachael Ray trademarks for premium pet food and pet snacks under an exclusive license which expires in 2063. The terms of the license include the payment of royalties to The Rachael Ray Foundation. Rachael Ray is a registered trademark of Ray Marks II LLC. Keurig® and K-Cup® are trademarks of Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (“Keurig”), used with permission. In addition, we and our subsidiaries license the use of several other trademarks, none of which are individually material to our business.
Slogans or designs considered to be important trademarks include, without limitation, “With A Name Like Smucker’s, It Has To Be Good®,” “The Best Part of Wakin’ Up Is Folgers In Your Cup®,” “Choosy Moms Choose Jif®,” “Purely The Finest®,” “Goodness Gracious, It’s Good®,” “The Only One Cats Ask For By Name®,” “Say It With Milk-Bone®,” the Smucker’s banner, the Crock Jar shape, the Gingham design, the Mountain Grown design, and the Smucker’s Strawberry, Jif, Milk-Bone, and 9Lives logos.
We own several hundred patents worldwide in addition to proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.
We consider all of our owned and licensed intellectual property, taken as a whole, to be essential to our business.
Seasonality: The U.S. Retail Coffee and U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segments have historically been seasonal around the Fall Bake and Holiday period, which generally resulted in higher sales and profits in our second and third quarters. Our success in promoting and merchandising our coffee and baking brands during the Fall Bake and Holiday period has had a significant impact on our results for a fiscal year. The Back to School period and the Spring Holiday season are two other important promotional periods. 
As a result of the U.S. baking business divestiture during the second quarter of 2019, we expect that the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment will experience less seasonality. Additionally, the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment, which grew during 2019 as a result of the Ainsworth acquisition during the first quarter, does not experience significant seasonality, further reducing the overall impact of seasonality to the total Company.
Working Capital: Working capital requirements have historically been greatest during the first half of our fiscal year mainly due to the timing of the buildup of coffee, oil, and baking inventories necessary to support the Fall Bake and Holiday period and the additional buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the Atlantic hurricane season. The impact of seasonality on our overall working capital requirements has been partially reduced by the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment, which does not 
3

experience significant seasonality. The divestiture of the U.S. baking business and the acquisition of Ainsworth during 2019 are expected to reduce the seasonality of our overall working capital requirements. 
Customers: Sales to Walmart Inc. and subsidiaries amounted to 32 percent, 31 percent, and 30 percent of net sales in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. These sales are primarily included in the U.S. retail market segments. No other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2019, 2018, or 2017. 
During 2019, our top 10 customers, collectively, accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales. Supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors continue to consolidate, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers. Although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits, we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands.
Orders: Generally, orders are filled within a few days of receipt, and the backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis.
Government Business: No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.
Competition: We are the branded market leader in the coffee, dog snacks, peanut butter, fruit spreads, natural shelf stable juices, shortening, and ice cream toppings categories in the U.S. In Canada, we are the branded market leader in the flour, pickles, fruit spreads, canned milk, shortening, and ice cream toppings categories. Our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products.
In order to remain competitive, companies in the food industry need to consider emerging consumer preferences, technological advances, product and packaging innovations, and the growth of certain retail channels, such as the 
e-commerce market. The primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are brand recognition, product quality, price, packaging, new product introductions, nutritional value, convenience, advertising, promotion, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include well-recognized brands, high-quality products, consumer trust, experienced brand and category management, a single national grocery broker in the U.S., varied product offerings, product innovation, good customer service, and an integrated distribution network.
The packaged foods industry has been challenged by a general decline in sales volume in the center of the store. Certain evolving consumer trends have contributed to the decline, such as a heightened focus on health and wellness, an increased desire for fresh foods, and the growing impact of social media and e-commerce on consumer behavior. To address these dynamics, we continue to focus on innovation with an increased emphasis on products that satisfy evolving consumer trends.
In addition, private label continues to be a competitor in many of the categories in which we compete, partially due to improvements in private label quality and the increased emphasis of store brands by retailers in an effort to cultivate customer loyalty. In our total U.S. retail categories, private label held a 16.6 dollar average market share during the 52 weeks ended April 21, 2019, as compared to a 16.4 dollar average market share during the same period in the prior year. We believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in the categories in which we compete, appealing to different consumer segments. We closely monitor the price gap or price premium between our brands and private label brands, with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets.

Environmental Matters: Compliance with environmental regulations and environmental sustainability is a key strategic focus as we consider it to be our responsibility as a good corporate citizen. We have public goals related to waste diversion, water usage intensity reduction, and greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction. We have implemented and manage a variety of programs across our operations, including energy optimization, the utilization of renewable energy, water conservation, the reuse of resources, and the support of farmers who implement sustainable practices, in support of our commitment to environmental sustainability. We continue to evaluate and modify our processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce waste and limit our impact on the environment.
Compliance with the provisions of enacted or pending federal, state, and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position in 2020.
Employees: At April 30, 2019, we had approximately 7,400 full-time employees worldwide, of which 24 percent, located at nine manufacturing locations, are covered by union contracts. These contracts vary in term depending on location, with seven contracts expiring in 2020, representing 19 percent of our total employees. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 
Information about our Executive Officers: The names, ages as of June 15, 2019, and current positions of our executive officers are listed below. All executive officers serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, with no fixed term of office.
