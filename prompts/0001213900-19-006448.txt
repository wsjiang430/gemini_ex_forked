Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview and Background
 
Princeton Capital Corporation’s predecessor was initially incorporated in Florida in 1959 as Electro-Mechanical Services, Inc. In 1998, it changed its name from Electro-Mechanical Services, Inc. to Regal One Corporation (“Regal One”). In 2005, the then board of directors of Regal One determined it would be in the best interest of shareholders to change the focus of Regal One’s operations to providing financial services through a network of advisors and professionals.
 
On July 14, 2014, Regal One, the Company (then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Regal One), Capital Point Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“CPP”), and Capital Point Partners II, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“CPPII” and, together with CPP, the “Partnerships”), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which we would acquire certain equity and debt investments of the Partnerships in exchange for shares of common stock. In addition to the customary conditions to closing the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, Regal One was required to (i) effect a reverse stock split of its then outstanding common stock at a ratio of 1-for-2, (ii) reincorporate from Florida to Maryland by merging with and into the Company with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Reincorporation”) and (iii) become an externally managed business development company (“BDC”) by entering into an external investment advisory agreement with Princeton Investment Advisors, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
 
On March 13, 2015, following the reverse stock split and the Reincorporation, we completed our previously announced acquisition in the approximate amounts of $11.2 million in cash, $43.5 million in equity & debt investments, and $1.9 million in restricted cash escrow deposits of the Partnerships with an aggregate value of approximately $56.6 million and issued approximately 115.5 million shares of our common stock to the Partnerships. The shares issued were based on a pre-valuation presumed fair value of $60.9 million.
 
On January 18, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) conditionally approved the investment advisory agreement with Princeton Advisory Group, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (“Princeton Advisory Group” or the “Former Investment Advisor”) (the “PAG Investment Advisory Agreement”), subject to the approval of the Company’s stockholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. At the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 9, 2016, the Company’s stockholders approved the PAG Investment Advisory Agreement, effective June 9, 2016. On June 27, 2017, the Board approved an annual renewal of the PAG Investment Advisory Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and the PAG Investment Advisory Agreement. From June 9, 2016 until its termination as of December 31, 2017, Princeton Advisory Group acted as the Company’s investment advisor pursuant to the terms of the PAG Investment Advisory Agreement (although, as stated herein, Princeton Advisory Group was originally notified of the Company’s intent to terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement on September 27, 2017, as further described herein).
 
As a result of the allegations contained in the complaints filed by the United States of America against Munish Sood, the former President, Chief Executive Officer, and director of the Company, and others captioned U.S. v. Lamont Evans, et al. and U.S. v. James Gotto, et al., in the Southern District of New York., on September 27, 2017 and as previously disclosed, the Board authorized and directed its Audit Committee (which consists of the Board’s three independent board members) to conduct an independent investigation into whether such events impacted the Company, and the extent to which any officer or employee of the Company may have been involved, and whether any corporate funds may have been utilized in the conduct alleged.

The Audit Committee conducted an independent investigation into this matter with the assistance of outside advisors. The investigation concluded on January 24, 2018. The investigation uncovered (i) no evidence that the allegations contained in the Complaints impacted the Company (other than the resignation of Mr. Sood), (ii) no evidence that any officer or employee of the Company, other than (as has been alleged) Mr. Sood, had any involvement in the allegations contained in the Complaints, and (iii) no evidence that any corporate or portfolio company funds were utilized in the conduct alleged in the Complaints. In respect to Mr. Sood, the Audit Committee did not make any judgment regarding the criminal allegations made by the U.S. Attorney in its Complaints.
 
On December 27, 2017, the Board determined that it would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to terminate the PAG Investment Advisory Agreement and sent a formal Notice of Termination to Princeton Advisory Group notifying Princeton Advisory Group of its termination as the Company’s investment advisor, effective as of December 31, 2017 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time. Also on December 27, 2017, the Board approved (specifically in accordance with Rule 15a-4(b)(1)(ii) of the Investment Company Act) and authorized the Company to enter into an Interim Investment Advisory Agreement between the Company and House Hanover, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“House Hanover”) (the “Interim Investment Advisory Agreement”), in accordance with Rule 15a-4 of the Investment Company Act. The effective date of the Interim Investment Advisory Agreement was January 1, 2018.
 
On April 5, 2018, the Board, including a majority of the independent directors, conditionally approved the Investment Advisory Agreement between the Company and House Hanover (the “House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement”) subject to the approval of the Company’s stockholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement replaced the Interim Investment Advisory Agreement. On May 30, 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement. The effective date of the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement was May 31, 2018.
 
Since January 1, 2018, House Hanover has acted as our investment advisor under the Interim Investment Advisory Agreement (from January 1, 2018 until May 31, 2018) and the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement (since May 31, 2018).
 
A summary of the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement was included in the Form 8-K filed on March 31, 2018 and the full text of the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 thereto and incorporated by reference therein.
 
The following discussion describes the Company as of December 31, 2018 as it relates to the financial statements covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K and as of the latest practicable date for other information about the Company.
 
General
 
We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We originate and invest primarily in private small and lower middle-market companies (typically those with less than $20.0 million of EBITDA) through first lien loans, second lien loans, unsecured loans, unitranche and mezzanine debt financing, often times with a corresponding equity investment. Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments in private small and lower middle-market companies. Since January 1, 2018, we have been managed by House Hanover, LLC, who also provides some of the administrative services necessary for us to operate.
 
As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than “qualifying assets” specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in “eligible portfolio companies.” Under the relevant Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules, the term “eligible portfolio company” includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized in the United States.

Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation by:
 

● | accessing the extensive origination channels that have been developed and established by our investment advisor that include long-standing relationships with private equity firms, commercial banks, investment banks and other financial services firms;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | investing in what we believe to be companies with strong business fundamentals, generally within our core small and lower middle-market company focus; 
● | focusing on a variety of industry sectors, including business services, energy, general industrial, government services, healthcare, software and specialty finance; 
● | directly originating transactions rather than participating in broadly syndicated financings; 
● | applying the disciplined underwriting standards that our investment advisor has developed over their extensive investing careers; and 
● | capitalizing upon the experience and resources of our investment advisor to monitor our investments. 

 
As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to continue to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a BDC, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowing. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing, such as the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of our securities and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook. Ultimately, we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowings.
 
The Company will be taxed as a C corporation and subject to federal and state corporation income taxes for its 2018 and 2017 taxable years.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 800 Turnpike Street, Suite 300, North Andover, Massachusetts 01845, and our telephone number is (978) 794-3366. We maintain a website on the Internet at www.princetoncapitalcorp.com. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K and you should not consider information contained on our website to be part of this annual report on Form 10-K.
 
House Hanover
 
Since January 1, 2018, House Hanover manages our investment activities and is responsible for analyzing investment opportunities, conducting research and performing due diligence on potential investments, negotiating and structuring our investments, originating prospective investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. House Hanover is a registered investment adviser and is wholly owned by Sema4, Inc.
House Hanover is headquartered in North Andover, Massachusetts.
 
Managerial Assistance
 
As a BDC, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board of directors and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. House Hanover will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We may receive fees for these services and will reimburse House Hanover for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to the review by our board of directors, including our independent directors.

Competition
 
Our primary competitors in providing financing to small and lower middle-market companies include public and private funds, other BDC’s, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to qualify as a regulated investment company or “RIC”. We did not meet the qualifications of a RIC for the 2017 or 2018 tax years.
Employees
 
We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by House Hanover. We have a chief executive officer and president, chief financial officer and chief compliance officer. To the extent necessary, our board of directors may hire additional personnel going forward. Our officers are employees or consultants of our investment advisor and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief executive officer and president, chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs is paid by us pursuant to the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement.
Management Agreements
 
Effective as of January 1, 2018, House Hanover serves as our investment advisor and is registered as an investment advisor under the 1940 Act. Prior to January 1, 2018, Princeton Advisory Group served as our investment advisor.
Summary of House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement
 
The terms and conditions of the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement and the Interim Investment Advisory Agreement are substantially similar, except that (i) the Interim Investment Advisory Agreement did not require approval in accordance with Rule 15a-4 of the 1940 Act and (ii) the duration of the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement is one year from the effective date (May 31, 2018) and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (a) the vote of the Board, or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company and (b) the vote of a majority of the members of the Board who are not parties to the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement or “interested persons” (as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) of any such party, in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act, as opposed to a 150-day limitation on the term, as set forth in the Interim Investment Advisory Agreement.

Advisory Services
 
House Hanover is registered as an investment adviser under the 1940 Act and serves as the Company’s investment advisor pursuant to the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement in accordance with the 1940 Act. House Hanover is owned by and an affiliate of Mr. Mark DiSalvo, the Company’s Interim President, Interim Chief Executive Officer, and a director of the Company. 
 
Subject to supervision by the Company’s Board, House Hanover oversees the Company’s day-to-day operations and provides the Company with investment advisory services. Under the terms of the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement, House Hanover, among other things: (i) determines the composition and allocation of the portfolio of the Company, the nature and timing of the changes therein and the manner of implementing such changes; (ii) identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments made by the Company; (iii) executes, closes, services and monitors the Company’s investments; (iv) determines the securities and other assets that the Company shall purchase, retain, or sell; (v) performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; (vi) provides the Company with such other investment advisory, research and related services as the Company may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of its funds; and (vii) if directed by the Board, assists in the execution and closing of the sale of the Company’s assets or a sale of the equity of the Company in one or more transactions. House Hanover’s services under the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement may not be exclusive and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to the Company are not impaired. At the request of the Company, House Hanover, upon any transition of the Company’s investment advisory relationship to another investment advisor or upon any internalization, shall provide reasonable transition assistance to the Company and any successor investment advisor.
 
Advisory Fee
 
Pursuant to the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company pays House Hanover a base management fee for investment advisory and management services. The cost of the base management fee is ultimately borne by the Company’s stockholders. The House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement does not contain an incentive fee component.
 
The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% of the Company’s gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage and excluding cash and cash equivalents net of all indebtedness of the Company for borrowed money and other liabilities of the Company. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears, and determined as set forth in the preceding sentence at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The Board may retroactively adjust the valuation of the Company’s assets and the resulting calculation of the base management fee in the event the Company or any of its assets are sold or transferred to an independent third party or the Company or House Hanover receives an audit report or other independent third party valuation of the Company. To the extent that any such adjustment increases or decreases the base management fee of any prior period, the Company will be obligated to pay the amount of increase to House Hanover or House Hanover will be obligated to refund the decreased amount, as applicable.
 
Payment of Expenses
 
House Hanover bears all compensation expense (including health insurance, pension benefits, payroll taxes and other compensation related matters) of its employees and consultants and bear the costs of any salaries or directors’ fees of any officers or directors of the Company who are affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of House Hanover. However, House Hanover, subject to approval by the Board of the Company, is entitled to reimbursement for the portion of any compensation expense and the costs of any salaries of any such employees to the extent attributable to services performed by such employees for the Company. During the term of the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement, House Hanover will also bear all of its costs and expenses for office space rental, office equipment, utilities and other non-compensation related overhead allocable to performance of its obligations under the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement.
 
Except as provided in the preceding paragraph the Company reimburses House Hanover all direct and indirect costs and expenses incurred by it during the term of the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement for: (i) due diligence of potential investments of the Company, (ii) monitoring performance of the Company’s investments, (iii) serving as officers of the Company, (iv) serving as directors and officers of portfolio companies of the Company, (v) providing managerial assistance to portfolio companies of the Company, and (vi) enforcing the Company’s rights in respect of its investments and disposing of its investments; provided, however, that, any third party expenses incurred by House Hanover in excess of $50,000 in the aggregate in any calendar quarter will require advance approval by the Board of the Company.
 
In addition to the foregoing, the Company will also be responsible for the payment of all of the Company’s other expenses, including the payment of the following fees and expenses:
 

● | organizational and offering expenses; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | expenses incurred in valuing the Company’s assets and computing its net asset value per share (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); 
● | subject to the guidelines approved by the Board, expenses incurred by House Hanover that are payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for the Company and in monitoring the Company’s investments and performing due diligence on the Company’s prospective portfolio companies or otherwise related to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments;
● | interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance the Company’s investments and expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts;

● | offerings of the Company’s common stock and other securities; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | administration fees; 
● | transfer agent and custody fees and expenses; 
● | U.S. federal and state registration fees of the Company (but not House Hanover); 
● | all costs of registration and listing the Company’s shares on any securities exchange; 
● | U.S. federal, state and local taxes; 
● | independent directors’ fees and expenses; 
● | costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required of the Company (but not House Hanover) by the SEC or other regulators; 
● | costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs; 
● | the costs associated with individual or group stockholders; 
● | the Company’s allocable portion of the fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; 
● | direct costs and expenses of administration and operation of the Company, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs; and
● | all other non-investment advisory expenses incurred by the Company in connection with administering the Company’s business. 

Duration and Termination
 
Unless terminated earlier as described below, the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement will continue in effect for a period of one (1) year from its effective date. It will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by the Company’s Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting securities, and, in either case, if also approved by a majority of Company’s directors who are neither parties to the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement nor “interested persons” (as defined under the 1940 Act) of any such party. The House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, (i) upon written notice, effective on the date set forth in such notice, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or by the vote of the Company’s directors, or (ii) upon 60 days’ written notice, by House Hanover. The House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its “assignment,” as defined in the 1940 Act.
Indemnification
 
The House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of their duties, or by reason of the material breach or reckless disregard of their duties and obligations under the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement, House Hanover and its officers, managers, employees and members are entitled to indemnification from the Company for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of House Hanover’s services under the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as the Company’s investment advisor. The amounts payable for indemnification will be calculated net of payments recovered by the indemnified party under any insurance policy with respect to such losses.
 
At all times during the term of the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement and for one year thereafter, House Hanover is obligated to maintain directors and officers/errors and omission liability insurance in an amount and with a provider reasonably acceptable to the Board of the Company.
 
Regulation as a BDC 
 
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and intend, as soon as we become eligible, to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”.) The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDC’s and their affiliates (including any investment advisors), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities.
 
- 6 -

 

We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of these policies is fundamental and may be changed without stockholder approval upon 60 days’ prior written notice to stockholders. 
 
Qualifying Assets
 
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as “qualifying assets,” unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following:

(1) | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. Under the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, “eligible portfolio companies” include (1) private domestic operating companies, (2) public domestic operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange) or registered under the Exchange Act, and (3) public domestic operating companies having a market capitalization of less than $250 million. Public domestic operating companies whose securities are quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board or through Pink Sheets LLC are not listed on a national securities exchange and therefore are eligible portfolio companies.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from a person who is or has been, within the past 13 months, an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident to such a private transaction, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities that mature in one year or less from the date of investment.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area.
 
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
 
In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, a BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance. However, when the BDC purchases securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers, employees or agents, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. House Hanover will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance.

Temporary Investments
 
Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets or temporary investments. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as the agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit.
Senior Securities
 
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. A loan will be considered temporary if it is repaid within sixty days and is not extended or renewed.
Common Stock 
 
We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount).
Other
 
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
 
House Hanover and the Company will each be required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of relevant federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.
 
We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The SEC has interpreted the BDC prohibition on transactions with affiliates to prohibit all “joint transactions” between, among other things, entities that share a common investment advisor. The staff of the SEC has granted no-action relief permitting purchases of a single class of privately placed securities provided that the advisor negotiates no term other than price and certain other conditions are met.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:
 

● | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuant to Item 307 under Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any remedial actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
