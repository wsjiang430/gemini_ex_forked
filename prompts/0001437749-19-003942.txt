Competition
 
The Corporation competes for deposits with other commercial banks, savings associations and credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and other securities, such as shares in money market mutual funds. Primary factors in competing for deposits include customer service, interest rates and convenience. In making loans, the Corporation competes with other commercial banks, savings associations, consumer finance companies, credit unions, leasing companies, mortgage companies and other lenders. Competition is affected by, among other things, the general availability of lendable funds, general and local economic conditions, current interest rate levels and other factors that are not readily predictable. The financial services industry is likely to become more competitive as further technology advances enable more companies to provide financial services. We compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices, and by maintaining our products and services offerings to keep pace with customer preferences in the regions that we operate.
 
In recent years, mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive pressure on our core banking products and services. Consolidation continued during 2018, primarily through private merger and acquisition transactions, and led to redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to other financial institutions. We expect this trend to continue during 2019. We, therefore, expect competition in the markets we serve to intensify with the advent of new technology and consolidation trends. As a matter of course, we continue to evaluate opportunities in the markets we serve or contiguous markets to improve our footprint, while balancing the efficiency of technology.
 
The Bank’s primary market area consists of the Ohio counties of Putnam, Allen, Wood and Marion, in which the Bank currently operates 14 of its 19 total full service banking offices. According to the most recent FDIC Deposit Market Share Report, as of June 30, 2018 there were a total of 25 banking institutions competing in the Bank’s primary market area, with the Bank ranking fifth in deposit market share with approximately 9.46% of the aggregate deposits.  The Bank operates its remaining five branch banking offices in the Ohio counties of Delaware, Franklin, Hancock and Sandusky. According to the most recent market data, there were 38 banking institutions competing in these markets, with the Bank ranking 22nd in deposit market share with approximately 0.21% of the aggregate deposits.  
 

Supervision and Regulation
 
General
 
The following discussion addresses the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to financial holding companies, like UBOH, and our subsidiary bank, Union Bank. This regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) of the FDIC, and the banking system as a whole, rather than for the protection of security holders and creditors. We cannot predict changes in the applicable laws, regulations and regulatory agency policies, yet such changes may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
UBOH
 
On October 10, 2018, UBOH elected to become a financial holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended, in order to provide the flexibility to take advantage of the expanded powers available to a financial holding company under the Act.  As a financial holding company, UBOH is subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As a financial holding company, UBOH is still subject to all material regulations applicable to bank holding companies.
 
Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the "GLB Act"), enacted into law in 1999, a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature.  Activities that are "financial in nature" include securities underwriting, dealing and market-making, sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and agency, merchant banking, and activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to banking.  Federal Reserve Board approval is not required for UBOH to acquire a company, other than a bank holding company, bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board.  Prior Federal Reserve Board approval is required before UBOH may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company, bank or savings association.  If any subsidiary bank of UBOH ceases to be "well capitalized" or "well managed" under applicable regulatory standards, the Federal Reserve Board may, among other actions, order UBOH to divest the subsidiary bank.  Alternatively, UBOH may elect to conform its activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company.  If any subsidiary bank of UBOH receives a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 of less than “satisfactory,” UBOH will be prohibited from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies, banks or savings associations.  
 
Under federal law, bank and financial holding companies must also serve as a “source of financial strength” to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance to them in the event of their financial distress.  This support may be required when we do not have the resources to, or would prefer not to, provide it.  In addition, certain loans by a bank or financial holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in, and certain other indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank, and federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bank or financial holding company, any commitment to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
 
Union Bank
 
As an Ohio state-chartered bank, and a member of the DIF, administered by the FDIC, Union Bank is supervised and regulated by the ODFI and the FDIC. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and conducts examinations of and requires reporting by FDIC-insured institutions under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the “FDIA”).
 
Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States and the State of Ohio affect the operations of Union Bank, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans which may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon, restrictions relating to investments and other activities, limitations on credit exposure to correspondent banks, limitations on activities based on capital and surplus, limitations on payment of dividends, and limitations on branching.

As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank, Union Bank is required to, among other things, maintain an investment in capital stock of the FHLB. Union Bank receives dividends on its investment in FHLB stock. Under certain conditions, secured advances to Union Bank are available from the FHLB to meet operational requirements. Such advances are renewable and can be obtained up to specified dollar amounts. These advances are secured primarily by Union Bank’s eligible mortgage loans and FHLB stock.
 
Regulatory capital and liquidity
 
Current regulatory capital requirements
 
Federal banking regulators have promulgated risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements applicable to UBOH and Union Bank. The adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by federal banking agencies in their examination and supervision processes, and in the evaluation of applications in connection with certain expansion activities.
 
The risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking regulators and effective through December 31, 2018, include both a definition and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. The minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. At least 4% is to be comprised of common shareholders’ equity (including retained earnings but excluding treasury stock), noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (“Tier 1 capital”). The remainder (“Tier 2 capital”) may consist, among other things, of mandatory convertible debt securities, a limited amount of subordinated debt, other preferred stock and a limited amount of allowance for loan losses. Each of the federal banking agencies also impose a minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) for banking organizations. The minimum leverage ratio is currently 3% for bank holding companies that are considered “strong” under the Federal Reserve Board’s guidelines or which have implemented the Federal Reserve Board’s risk-based capital measure for market risk. The minimum leverage ratio is 1%-2% higher for other bank holding companies and banks based on their particular circumstances and risk profiles and for those banks experiencing or anticipating significant growth. The FDIC imposes similar capital requirements on Union Bank adopted by the FDIC.
 
The Corporation currently satisfies all capital requirements. Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject a banking institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal and state regulatory authorities, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC. The junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued in 2003 and the trust preferred securities from the acquisition of The Ohio State Bank (“OSB”), as described in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements contained in the Corporation’s Annual Report, currently qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes. However, it is possible that regulations could change so that such securities do not qualify.
 
The federal banking regulators have established regulations governing prompt corrective action to resolve capital deficient banks. Under these regulations, institutions, which become under capitalized, become subject to mandatory regulatory scrutiny and limitations that increase as capital decreases. Such institutions are also required to file capital plans with their primary federal regulator, and their holding companies must guarantee the capital shortfall up to 5% of the assets of the capital deficient institution at the time it becomes under capitalized.
 
The FDIA requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to an FDIC-insured depository institution that does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. Banks and savings associations are classified into one (1) of five (5) categories based upon capital adequacy, ranging from “well-capitalized” to “critically under capitalized.” Restrictions on operations, management and capital distributions begin to apply at “adequately capitalized” status and become progressively stricter as the insured depository institutions approaches “critically under capitalized” status. Generally, the regulations require the appropriate federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action with respect to an institution which becomes “under capitalized” and to take additional actions if the institution becomes “significantly under capitalized” or “critically under capitalized.” Effective January 1, 2015, final rules promulgated by the FDIC pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, provide that for a depository institution to be considered well-capitalized it must maintain common equity tier 1 capital of at least 6.5%; tier 1 risk-based capital of at least 8%; total risk-based capital of at least 10%; and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. As of December 31, 2018, Union Bank has total risk-based capital of 11.7%, tier 1 risk-based capital and CET 1 capital of 11.1%, and tier 1 leverage of 8.8%. 
 
While the Prompt Corrective Action requirements only apply to FDIC-insured depository institutions and not to bank or financial holding companies, the mandatory Prompt Corrective Action “capital restoration plan” required of an under capitalized institution by its relevant regulator must be guaranteed to a limited extent by the institution’s parent bank or financial holding company.

In October 2013, the federal banking regulators published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”). The Regulatory Capital Rules implement the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework known as “Basel III” for strengthening international capital standard as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The implementation of the Regulatory Capital Rules has led to higher capital requirements and more restrictive leverage liquidity ratios. In addition, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, such as dividend payments and certain bonus payments to executive officers, the Regulatory Capital Rules require insured financial institutions to hold a capital conservation buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer has been phased in over time becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019, and consists of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The Regulatory Capital Rules also revise the regulatory agencies’ prompt corrective action framework by incorporating the new regulatory capital minimums and updating the definition of common equity. The Regulatory Capital Rules phase in began on January 1, 2015, for non-advanced approaches banking organizations, like UBOH and Union Bank and has been fully phased in by January 1, 2019. While UBOH and Union Bank currently meet all regulatory capital requirements, the ultimate impact upon the financial condition or results of operations cannot be predicted until the rules become fully-phased in.
 
The ability of a bank or financial holding company to obtain funds for the payment of dividends and for other cash requirements is largely dependent on the amount of dividends that may be declared by its subsidiary bank and other subsidiaries. However, the Federal Reserve Board expects the Corporation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank, which may require it to retain capital for further investment in the subsidiary, rather than for dividends for shareholders of UBOH. The Bank may not pay dividends to UBOH if, after paying such dividends, it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under the risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage ratio requirements. The Bank must have the approval of its regulatory authorities if a dividend in any year would cause the total dividends for that year to exceed the sum of the current year’s net income and the retained net income for the preceding two years, less required transfers to surplus. Payment of dividends by a bank subsidiary may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the regulatory authorities, if they deem such dividends to constitute an unsafe and/or unsound banking practice. These provisions could have the effect of limiting UBOH’s ability to pay dividends on its outstanding common shares. For more information about the payment of dividends by Union Bank to UBOH, please see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements contained in the Corporation's Annual Report.
 
FDIA and Resolution Authority
 
Federal Deposit Insurance Act
 
The FDIC’s DIF provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, which insurance is funded through assessments on banks, like Union Bank. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the amount of deposit insurance coverage for deposits increased to $250,000 per depositor. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (the “DRR”), that is, the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FDIC to amend its assessment regulations so that future assessments will generally be based upon a depository institution’s average total consolidated assets minus the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period, whereas assessments were previously based on the amount of an institution’s insured deposits. The minimum DIF rate will increase from 1.15% to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and the cost of the increase will be borne by depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rule making if required.
 
Conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions
 
Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, the FDIC will be appointed as receiver or, in rare circumstances, conservator for the insolvent institution under the FDIA. In an insolvency, the FDIC may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution’s affairs. If the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership (or conservatorship) for breach of contract, the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon, among other factors, the receivership assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others. In addition, the FDIC may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution, notwithstanding any provision that would terminate, cause a default, accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency, the appointment of the receiver (or conservator), or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver (or conservator). The FDIC may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution’s shareholders or creditors. These provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of UBOH’s insured depository institution subsidiary, including any obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors.
 
 8


Depositor preference
 
The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors (including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the FDIC) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will be placed ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the institution’s parent bank, holding company and subordinated creditors, in order of priority of payment.
 
Other Regulatory Developments under the Dodd-Frank Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, is complex and several of its provisions are still being implemented. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act altered the authority and duties of the federal banking and securities regulatory agencies, implemented certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies including financial institutions with regard to executive compensation, proxy access by shareholders, and certain whistleblower provisions, and restricted certain proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates.
 
Federal regulators continue to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act created many new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions. Currently, federal regulators are still in the process of drafting the implementing regulations for some portions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Corporation is closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure continued compliance with these regulatory requirements. The following discussion summarizes significant aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that are already affecting or may affect UBOH and Union Bank:
 


● | the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the deposit insurance assessment base for federal deposit insurance has been expanded from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity; 
● | the prohibition on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits has been repealed; 
● | the standard maximum amount of deposit insurance per customer has been permanently increased to $250,000; 
● | new corporate governance requirements require new compensation practices, including, but not limited to, providing shareholders the opportunity to cast a non-binding vote on executive compensation, requiring compensation committees to consider the independence of compensation advisors and meeting new executive compensation disclosure requirements; 
● | the Federal Reserve Board has established rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion. Although the cap is not applicable to Union Bank, it may have an adverse effect on Union Bank as the debit cards issued by Union Bank and other smaller banks, which have higher interchange fees, may become less competitive; 
● | “ability to repay” regulations generally require creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination (considering at least 8 specified underwriting factors) of a consumer’s ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling (excluding an open-end credit plan, timeshare plan, reverse mortgage or temporary loan) and provides a presumption that the creditor making a “qualified mortgage” satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements; and
● | the authority of the Federal Reserve Board to examine financial holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries was expanded. 

 
Some aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are still subject to rulemaking and will take effect in the coming years, making it difficult to anticipate the full financial impact on the Corporation, their respective customers or the financial services industry more generally. However, the implementation of certain provisions have already increased compliance costs and the implementation of future provisions will most likely further increase both compliance costs and fees paid to regulators, along with possibly restricting the operations of the Corporation.
 
The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)
 
The BSA requires all financial institutions (including banks and securities broker-dealers) to, among other things, maintain a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting) as well as due diligence and know-your-customer documentation requirements. Union Bank has established and maintains an anti-money laundering program to comply with the BSA’s requirements.
 
 9


Bank transactions with affiliates
 
Federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates, including the bank’s parent holding company and certain companies the parent holding company may be deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’s-length terms, and cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the holding company may be required to provide it.
 
Other Regulations
 
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Bank's loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as:

• | the Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The deposit operations of the Bank are subject to:
 
• | the Truth-In-Savings Act, governing disclosures of account terms to consumer depositers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the "Electronic Funds Transfer Act" and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement that act, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers' rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. | The following tables set forth the effect of volume and rate changes on interest income and expenses for the periods indicated. For purposes of these tables, changes in interest due to volume and rate were determined as follows:
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Volume variance - change in volume multiplied by the previous year’s rate.
 
Rate variance - change in rate multiplied by the previous year’s volume.
 
Rate/volume variance - change in volume multiplied by the change in rate.
 

● | This variance was allocated to volume variances and rate variances in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each.

III. | LOAN PORTFOLIO (CONTINUED)
-----+---------------------------


1. | Discussion of the non-accrual policy
---+-------------------------------------

 
The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is generally discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. Personal loans are typically charged-off no later than when they become 150 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.
 
All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off is reversed against interest income. Interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
 

2. | Potential problem loans
---+------------------------

 
As of December 31, 2018, in addition to the $2.2 million of loans reported under Item III C, there are approximately $4.5 million of other outstanding loans where known information causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans pursuant to Item III C at some future date. Consideration was given to loans classified for regulatory purposes as substandard or special mention that have not been disclosed in Item III C above.

(1) | Including loans held for sale.
----+-------------------------------

 
The amount of loan charge-offs and recoveries fluctuate from year to year due to various factors relating to the condition of the general economy and specific business segments. The 2018 loan charge-offs included 28 consumer, mortgage, HELOC or commercial credits, with the largest individual charge-off being $85,000. The 2017 loan charge-offs included 38 consumer, mortgage, HELOC or commercial credits, with the largest individual charge-off being $406,000. The 2016 net recoveries included 46 consumer, mortgage, HELOC, commercial or agricultural credits, with the largest individual charge-off being $86,000. The 2015 loan charge-offs included 25 consumer, mortgage, HELOC, commercial or agricultural credits, with the largest individual charge-off being $327,000. In 2014, the net recoveries of $256,000 included seven commercial or agricultural borrowers, with the largest charge-off being $181,000. 
 
 21



IV. | SUMMARY OF LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE (CONTINUED)
----+--------------------------------------------

 
The Corporation recognized a provision for loan losses of $450,000 in 2018, a credit for loan losses of $350,000 in 2017, and a credit for loan losses of $750,000 in 2016. Problem and potential problem loans aggregated $6.7 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $8.0 million December 31, 2017. The Corporation will continue to monitor the credit quality of its loan portfolio, and especially the quality of those credits identified as problem or potential problem credits, to ensure the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an appropriate level.
 
The allowance for loan losses balance and the provision for loan losses are judgmentally determined by management based upon periodic reviews of the loan portfolio. In addition, management considered the level of charge-offs on loans as well as the fluctuations of charge-offs and recoveries on loans including the factors which caused these changes. Estimating the risk of loans and the amount of loss is necessarily subjective. Accordingly, the allowance is maintained by management at a level considered adequate to cover losses that are currently anticipated based on past loss experience, general economic conditions, information about specific borrower situations including their financial position and collateral value and other factors and estimates which are subject to change over time.

V. | DEPOSITS
---+---------

 
Deposits have traditionally been the Corporation’s primary funding source for use in lending and other investment activities. In addition to deposits, the Corporation derives funds from interest and principal repayments on loans and income from other earning assets. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows tend to fluctuate in response to economic conditions and interest rates. Deposits are attracted principally from within the Corporation's designated market area by offering a variety of deposit instruments, including regular savings accounts, demand deposit accounts, money market deposit accounts, term certificate accounts, and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees, and withdrawal penalties for the various types of accounts are established periodically by the Corporation’s management based on the Corporation's liquidity requirements, growth goals, and market trends. From time to time, the Corporation may also acquire brokered deposits. The amount of deposits from outside the Corporation’s market area is not significant.
