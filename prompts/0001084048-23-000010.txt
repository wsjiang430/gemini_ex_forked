Item 1.    Business
Overview
Ziff Davis, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“Ziff Davis”, the “Company”, “our”, “us” or “we”), is a vertically focused digital media and internet company whose portfolio includes leading brands in technology, shopping, gaming and entertainment, connectivity, health, cybersecurity, and martech. Our Digital Media business specializes in the technology, shopping, gaming and entertainment, connectivity, and healthcare markets, offering content, tools and services to consumers and businesses. Our Cybersecurity and Martech business provides cloud-based subscription services to consumers and businesses including cybersecurity, privacy and marketing technology. 
Our Digital Media business generates revenues from advertising and sponsorships, subscription and usage fees, performance marketing, and licensing fees. This business generates revenues from the sale of display and video advertising; customer clicks to online merchants, as well as, commissions on sales attributed to clicks to online merchants; business-to-business leads sold to information technology (“IT”) vendors; the licensing of technology, data, and other intellectual property to clients; and the sale of subscription services to consumers and businesses. Our Cybersecurity and Martech businesses generate revenues primarily from customer subscription and usage fees. Our consolidated revenues are currently generated primarily from two basic business models, each with different financial profiles and variability. Our Digital Media business is driven primarily by advertising revenues, has relatively higher sales and marketing expenses, and has seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. Our Cybersecurity and Martech business is driven by subscription revenues, with relatively stable and predictable margins from quarter to quarter. We continue to pursue additional acquisitions, which may include companies operating under business models that differ from those we operate under today. Such acquisitions could impact our consolidated profit margins and the variability of our revenues. 
Ziff Davis was incorporated in 2014 as a Delaware corporation through the creation of a holding company structure. Our Cybersecurity and Martech businesses are operated by our wholly owned subsidiary J2 Global Ventures, LLC. Prior to the spin-off of Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc. (“Consensus”), our Cybersecurity and Martech businesses were operated by our former wholly owned subsidiary J2 Cloud Services, LLC, which was founded in 1995, and subsidiaries of J2 Cloud Services, LLC. On October 7, 2021 (the “Distribution Date”), the Company completed the previously announced separation (the “Separation”) of its cloud fax business into Consensus, an independent publicly traded company, and the Company transferred J2 Cloud Services, LLC to Consensus who in turn transferred non-fax assets and liabilities back to Ziff Davis, such that Consensus was left with the cloud fax business. In connection with the Separation, we changed our name to Ziff Davis, Inc. from J2 Global, Inc. (for certain events prior to October 7, 2021, the Company may be referred to as J2 Global). The Separation was achieved through the Company’s distribution of 80.1% of the shares of Consensus common stock to holders of Company common stock as of the close of business on October 1, 2021, the record date for the distribution. 
Programmatic Mergers and Acquisitions
In addition to growing our business organically, on a regular basis, we acquire businesses to grow our customer bases, expand and diversify our service offerings, enhance our technologies, acquire skilled personnel, and enter into new markets. Our programmatic approach to mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) is a central tenet of our capital allocation strategy, which seeks to optimize the allocation of our investable capital, including the free cash flow generated by our businesses, to M&A, share repurchases, and the strengthening of our balance sheet. Since 2012, we have deployed approximately $3.0 billion on more than 80 acquisitions across the globe in a variety of verticals within the internet and software categories (exclusive of any acquisitions that were part of businesses we have since divested). Our highly systematic and repeatable M&A process allows us to execute a large volume of M&A with velocity and conviction. Our M&A program is built on a rigorous and analytical approach that leverages deep industry knowledge, technological expertise, and investment acumen. Our evaluation criteria for potential acquisitions varies by sector, but our focus on value-oriented fundamentals is a central factor in every transaction we evaluate. We seek to acquire businesses that can generate predictable growing free cash flow over long time horizons. The primary metric we use to differentiate opportunities in our M&A pipeline is the expected internal rate of return that the potential acquisition will generate for Ziff Davis. While we take a highly disciplined approach to the evaluation of M&A, we have a wide aperture and significant flexibility when it comes to the types of transactions we are capable of evaluating and executing. Since 2010, we have acquired venture-backed growth companies, distressed businesses in need of turnaround, complex corporate carve-outs, founder-owned businesses, public companies and private equity-backed businesses. We also have a multi-faceted approach to transaction sourcing that ranges from participation in sell-side auctions led by investment banks to the sourcing of proprietary transactions through our executive network. Acquisitions broadly fall into one of two categories at Ziff Davis: (1) tuck-ins or (2) platform acquisitions. Our tuck-in acquisitions are typically focused on the acquisition of: (a) a customer base, (b) a strong but under monetized media audience or (c) a new product or service that can be sold to our existing customers or audience. Platform acquisitions are businesses at scale that can stand on their own within Ziff Davis and which we believe have the potential to serve as a platform for future M&A. Since 2012, the majority of our acquisitions by deal count have been tuck-

ins. However, over the same period of time, the capital allocated to tuck-ins versus platform acquisitions has been more evenly balanced.
Digital Media
Our Digital Media business operates a portfolio of web properties and apps which includes IGN, RetailMeNot, Mashable, PCMag, Humble Bundle, Speedtest, Offers.com, Black Friday, MedPageToday, Everyday Health, BabyCenter, and What to Expect, among others. Our properties provide trusted reviews of technology, shopping, gaming, and entertainment products and services; news and commentary related to their vertical markets; professional networking tools, targeted emails, and white papers for IT professionals; speed testing and the related data for internet and mobile network connections; online deals and discounts for consumers; news, interactive tools, and mobile applications that enable consumers to manage a broad array of health and wellness needs on a daily basis, including medical conditions, pregnancy, diet, and fitness; and news, tools and information for healthcare professionals to stay abreast of industry, legislative, regulatory, and continuing education developments across major medical specialties.
Our Digital Media business generates revenues from advertising and sponsorships, subscription and usage fees, performance marketing and licensing fees. 
Display and Video Advertising - We sell online display and video advertising on our owned-and-operated web properties and on third-party sites. We have contractual arrangements with advertisers either directly or through agencies. The terms of these contracts specify the price of the advertising to be sold and the volume of advertisements that will be served over the course of a campaign. Additionally, we have contractual arrangements with certain third-party websites not owned by us, and third-party advertising networks to deliver online display and video advertising to their websites or to third-party sites.
Subscriptions - We primarily offer subscription and licensing services to businesses for Speedtest Intelligence, which offers up-to-date insights into global fixed broadband and mobile performance data, as well as, monthly subscription packages to consumers through the Lose It! weight loss app and through Humble Bundle.
Performance Marketing - We generate business-to-business leads for IT vendors through the marketing of content, including white papers and webinars, and offer additional lead qualification and nurturing services. On the consumer side, we generate clicks to online merchants by promoting deals and discounts on our web properties.
Licensing - We license our proprietary technology, data, and intellectual property to third parties for various purposes. For instance, we will license the right to use PCMag’s “Editors’ Choice” logo and other copyrighted editorial content to businesses whose products have earned such distinction.
We believe competitive factors relating to attracting and retaining users include the ability to provide premium and exclusive content and the reach, effectiveness, and efficiency of our marketing services to attract consumers, advertisers, healthcare professionals and publishers. We continue to seek opportunities to acquire additional web properties, both within and outside of the technology, shopping, gaming and entertainment, connectivity, and health and wellness verticals, with the goal of monetizing their audiences and content through application of our proprietary technologies and insight.
Our Digital Media properties and services include the following five primary platforms: (1) technology, (2) shopping, (3) gaming and entertainment, (4) connectivity, and (5) health and wellness.
Technology
Our technology platform includes online publishers, as well as tools and services tailored to consumers, professionals, and organizations looking for technological expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness.

Our publishing sites are also recognized as trusted global sources of stories for more than a dozen platforms, including Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. We also provide digital content for buyers of IT products and services, allowing IT vendors to identify, reach and influence corporate IT decision makers who are actively researching specific IT purchases.
Mashable is a trusted global media brand publishing premium content for individuals interested in technology and culture. Mashable produces stories for more than a dozen platforms, including Snapchat, Twitter, and Facebook.

Competition
Competition in the digital media space is fierce and continues to intensify. 
Our digital media business competes with (i) diversified internet and digital media companies like IAC/InterActiveCorp, Future PLC, Red Ventures, and Internet Brands, (ii) vertical-specific digital media companies like RVO Health, TechTarget, Vox, Centerfield, Doximity, CarGurus, and Fandom and (iii) other large sellers of advertising including Alphabet, Meta, Snap, Twitch, and others. We believe that the primary competitive factors determining our success in the market for our digital media products and services include the reputation of our brands as trusted sources of objective information, our ability to attract internet users and advertisers to our web properties, and our expertise in multiple methods of monetization. Some of these companies may have greater financial and other resources than we do. 
For more information regarding the competition that our Digital Media business faces, please refer to the section Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cybersecurity and Martech
Our Cybersecurity and Martech business provides subscription based, software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions, with relatively stable and predictable revenue and margins from quarter to quarter. We generate substantially all of our Cybersecurity 
-6-


and Martech revenues from “fixed” subscription revenues for customer subscriptions and, to a lesser extent, “variable” usage revenues generated from actual usage by our subscribers. 
Consumers and businesses of all sizes are increasingly subscribing to cloud-based services to meet their communication, messaging, security, privacy, customer marketing and other needs. Our Cybersecurity and Martech services represent a model for delivering and consuming, real time business technology services, resources and solutions over the internet. Their goal is to reduce or eliminate costs, increase sales and enhance productivity, mobility, business continuity and security.

We believe these services represent more efficient and less expensive solutions than many existing alternatives, and provide increased security, privacy, flexibility and mobility.
We market our Cybersecurity and Martech offerings to a broad spectrum of prospective business customers including sole proprietors, small to medium-sized businesses and enterprises. We also market our Cybersecurity and Martech offerings to consumers. Our marketing efforts include enhancing brand awareness; utilizing online advertising, search engines and affiliate programs; selling through both a telesales and direct sales force; and working with resellers and other channel partners. We continuously seek to extend the number of distribution channels through which we acquire paying customers and improve the cost and volume of customers obtained through our current channels.
Our Cybersecurity and Martech businesses operate as the VIPRE Security Group and the MOZ Group, respectively.
VIPRE Security Group
The VIPRE Security Group’s offerings include endpoint and email security, security awareness training, secure backup and file sharing, and virtual private network solutions. We offer these services to consumers who are worried about their digital safety and personal information, and to small businesses and mid-sized enterprises who want advanced cyber threat protection.

Competition
Our Cybersecurity and Martech business faces competition from, among others, email marketing solution providers, marketing automation services, cybersecurity software and service vendors, and virtual private networks. Our online cybersecurity solutions compete against publicly-traded and privately-held providers of cybersecurity solutions and related software, such as Palo Alto Networks, Crowdstrike, Proofpoint, NortonLifeLock, Kape Technologies, KnowBe4, and Malwarebytes. Our marketing technology solutions compete directly with various providers of search engine optimization technology and communication platforms that provide email and voice-related services to small- and medium-sized businesses, including companies like SEMRush, MailChimp, The Campaign Monitor Group, Constant Contact, and Dialpad. Our Cybersecurity and Martech business also competes against diversified and acquisitive vertical market software providers like Constellation Software. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do. 
We believe that the primary competitive factors determining our success in the market for Cybersecurity and Martech services include our financial strength and stability; pricing; reputation for reliability and security of service; intellectual property ownership; effectiveness of customer support; sign-up, service, and software ease-of-use; service scalability; customer messaging and branding; geographic coverage; scope of services; currency and payment method acceptance; and local language sales, messaging, and support. 
For more information regarding the competition that our Cybersecurity and Martech businesses faces, please refer to the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality
Revenues associated with our Digital Media business are subject to seasonal fluctuations, becoming most active during the fourth quarter holiday period due to increased retail activity. Our Cybersecurity and Martech revenues are impacted by the number of effective business days in a given period. We traditionally experience lower than average Cybersecurity and Martech usage and customer sign-ups in the fourth quarter. 
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We regard the protection of our intellectual property rights as important to our success. We aggressively protect these rights by relying on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade dress, and trade secrets. We also enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information.
Through a combination of internal technology development and acquisitions, we have built a portfolio of numerous U.S. and foreign patents. We intend to continue to invest in patents, to aggressively protect our patent assets from unauthorized use, and to generate patent licensing revenues from authorized users. 
We have generated royalties from licensing certain of our patents and have enforced certain patents against companies using our patented technology without our permission.
We seek patents for inventions that may contribute to our business or the technology sector. In addition, we have multiple pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, covering components of our technology and in some cases technologies beyond those that we currently offer. Unless and until patents are issued on the pending applications, no patent rights can be enforced. 
We have obtained patent licenses for certain technologies where such licenses are necessary or advantageous.
We own and use a number of trademarks in connection with our services, including word and/or logo trademarks for IGN, Everyday Health, BabyCenter, Humble Bundle, PCMag, Mashable, Ookla, Speedtest, and RetailMeNot, among others. Many of these trademarks are registered worldwide, and numerous trademark applications are pending around the world. We hold numerous internet domain names, including “everydayhealth.com”, “retailmenot.com”, “pcmag.com”, “ign.com”, 
-8-


“speedtest.net”, “offers.com”, “humblebundle.com”, “mashable.com”, and “babycenter.com”, among others. We have filed to protect our rights to our brands in certain alternative top-level domains such as “.org”, “.net”, “.biz”, “.info” and “.us”, among others.
Like other technology-based businesses, we face the risk that we will be unable to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, and the risk that we will be found to have infringed the proprietary rights of others. For more information regarding these risks, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Research and Development
The markets for our services are evolving rapidly, requiring ongoing expenditures for research and development and timely introduction of new services and service enhancements. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to enhance our current services, to respond effectively to technological changes, attract and retain engineering talent, sell additional services to our existing customer base, and introduce new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers.
We devote significant resources to develop new services and service enhancements. Our research, development and engineering expenditures were $74.1 million, $78.9 million and $57.1 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For more information regarding the technological risks that we face, please refer to the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business over the internet and, in some cases, using services of third-party telecommunications and internet service providers. These include, among others, laws and regulations addressing privacy, data storage, retention and security, freedom of expression, content, taxation, numbers, advertising, and intellectual property. For information about the risks we face with respect to governmental regulation, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 4,400 employees, nearly evenly split between U.S. and non-U.S based employees. Our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate our highly qualified workforce is very important to our continued success. Approximately 50 of the editorial employees in our Digital Media business have elected to join a union. We chose to voluntarily recognize the union and have negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the union. None of our other employees are represented by collective bargaining.
Acquisition Strategy Impact on Human Capital
The Company has made more than 80 acquisitions since its inception, including six during 2022 (exclusive of any acquisitions that were part of businesses we have since divested). We believe that welcoming and integrating new groups of employees where each group has its own unique culture, organizational norms, and expectations, is a strength of ours. We believe that our integration approach reduces the human capital risk associated with our acquisition strategy, and we believe that our ability to effectively integrate new employees and businesses is a core competency of the Company. 
Our Culture
Culture at the Company operates on two levels. While we have a strong enterprise-wide culture that focuses on our core values – diversity, equity and inclusion, environmental sustainability, community, data privacy and security, and governance – we also have a strong network of micro-cultures that operate within many of our businesses and drive their success. Integrating those micro-cultures and values is important; we work hard to foster an environment of collaboration and embrace the power of small groups working together.
An important dimension of the enterprise culture at Ziff Davis continues to stem from our belief that profitability and corporate responsibility go hand in hand. We believe that “Doing is Greater than Talking,” which has been a rallying cry to employees, galvanizing them to take action to create social value and impact. 
With their work and many contributions, our employees play a crucial role in supporting the Company’s “Five Pillars of Purpose,” which continue to include:
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion - Reinforce our diverse workforce, reflect our diverse audiences, and extend upon our inclusive culture.
-9-


Environmental Sustainability - Reduce our environmental footprint and continue helping customers and users reduce their footprint.
Community - Support our employees worldwide and positively impact the communities around us.
Data Privacy and Security - Protect our data and customer data, ensure our product security, and respect the data privacy rights of our users.
Governance - Represent shareholders’ best interests with our rigorous and transparent corporate governance structure.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Our Digital Media audiences and Cybersecurity and Martech services users are diverse – gender, race, ethnicity, age, orientation, geography, education, background, interests, and more. We believe that for our business to succeed over the long term, the Company must have an inclusive corporate culture that embraces diversity and promotes equity across our enterprise.
We continue to take steps to promote that culture. To date, we have:
•Created the Ziff Davis Diversity Council, a diverse group of employees that develops recommendations for recruiting, mentorship, and advancement; 
•Supported six Employee Resource Groups to increase opportunities for networking, learning, and development;
•Expanded the Employee Resource Group program to include the Family Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) for caregivers, with more groups to come;
•Introduced DEI targets into our executive compensation program beginning in 2021; and
•Launched a mentorship program for all employees to leverage internal leadership and expertise.
We believe that transparency and accountability are important parts of managing human capital risk. To that end, in 2022 we published our third Annual Diversity Report, available on our website, which details our workforce race representation, gender representation, and details how those differ between our overall workforce and our senior employees, as well as introducing commitments to DEI initiatives within our current and future workforce. We are proud of our progress to date – and we recognize we have much more to do.
Hiring
We reinforce our culture and our values by seeking out diverse candidates, and looking for candidates that fit well with our organizational priorities. We have had success in this area: 36 percent of all recent new hires in the U.S. have been people of color, and 58 percent of recent new hires in the U.S. have been women. We are working to proactively attract more diverse talent; we double our referral bonus paid to employees when we hire a person of color they recommend; we continued our partnership with Professional Diversity Network to advertise our open roles to employees aligning with a multitude of identity groups; and we became a 2022 Afrotech conference sponsor. 
Employee Compensation & Benefits
Compensation is an important consideration for all of our employees and we strive to pay competitive compensation packages that reflect the success of the business and the individual contributions of each colleague. We are committed to fair pay practices and roles are periodically benchmarked to help inform where adjustments may be needed.
We care for our employees by providing benefits we believe are effective at attracting and retaining the talent critical for our success and, more importantly, assist in their day to day well-being. Those benefits include comprehensive health insurance coverage, covering 83% of health insurance premiums for covered U.S. employees in each of last three years, an employee stock purchase program, 401k program, flexible time off, free access to telemedicine, and up to 16 weeks of paid parental leave for birth parents. In addition, we offer paid sick, military, jury duty, and bereavement leave, paid short and long term disability leave, family planning support, a program offering free access to meditation and healthy eating apps, and monthly webinars focused on wellness through the “Wellness Your Way” program.
We support our local communities by providing employees with 16 hours annually of fully paid Volunteer Time Off, partnering with Benevity to support volunteer event opportunities globally. We also expanded our Employee Assistance Fund (“EAF”) with America’s Charities to help employees impacted by unexpected financial hardship resulting from natural and other disasters as well as personal hardship, supporting employees from India, the United States, and Canada, with plans to add more countries in the future.
-10-


Creating a culture where all colleagues feel supported and valued is paramount to our corporate mission. We have a mental health education program with quarterly events held throughout the year. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our colleagues’ health and wellness needs, which we believe is essential to attract and retain employees of the highest caliber, and we offer a competitive benefits package focused on fostering work/life integration.
Environment, Social and Governance
In March 2022, Ziff Davis issued its first annual Environmental, Social & Governance (“ESG”) Report. Included in the report were the findings from our first GreenHouse Gas inventory, which calculates our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Our ESG efforts focused on five critical pillars: diversity, equity and inclusion; environmental sustainability; community; data privacy and security; and governance. The report highlighted the policies, programs and practices Ziff Davis has in place to tackle critical challenges and the tangible results we have already achieved across our business, within our industry, and in our communities. Included in the report are details about several new programs including our Global Mentorship Program, and Internal Mobility Program, among others.
