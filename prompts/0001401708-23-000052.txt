Item 1. Business
Overview
We develop, manufacture and market technologies that unlock scientifically valuable and clinically actionable information from minute amounts of biological material, primarily for life science researchers in the fields of genomics and proteomics. Our mission is to offer an ecosystem of innovative discovery and translational research solutions that enable our customers to map the universe of biology and conduct scientific exploration that may lead to new therapies to improve the human condition. 
Our technologies include proprietary chemistries that enable the labeling and counting of single molecules. Our product platforms are used for scientific discovery and clinical research applications, often in connection with pharmaceutical product development and human clinical trials of potential new therapies. Our proprietary chemistries may reduce the number of steps required to conduct certain types of scientific experiments, enable the collection of multiple data points in a single experiment or allow for multiple experiments to be conducted at once. Our chemistries and instruments are also able to extract information from multiple types of biological samples, including those that are often challenging to work with using other scientific methods or platforms. As a result, we are able to develop tools that are easier for researchers to use and that may generate larger amounts of data, and faster, more consistent scientific results.
Our ecosystem of solutions consists of (i) our spatial biology platforms, including our GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, or “GeoMx DSP” or “GeoMx”, our CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager, or “CosMx SMI” or “CosMx,” and our AtoMx Spatial Informatics Platform, or “AtoMx SIP” or “AtoMx”, a cloud-based, open source and fully integrated informatics solution for use with GeoMx DSP and CosMx SMI, and (ii) our nCounter Analysis System, our original product platform for multi-plex bulk gene expression analysis. Our GeoMx, CosMx and nCounter product platforms include instruments, related consumables, software and services, have the versatility to detect both RNA and protein expression and are able to generate reliable and reproduceable data in a variety of biological sample types, including formalin fixed paraffin embedded, or FFPE, format.
Every living organism has a genome that contains a full set of biological instructions required to build and maintain life. A gene is a specific set of instructions embedded in the deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, of a cell. For a gene to be “turned on,” or “expressed”, a cell must first transcribe a copy of a portion, or sequence, of its DNA code into molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid, or RNA. Then, the cell translates the expressed information contained in RNA into proteins that form the building blocks of organisms and biological processes.
The decoding of the human and other genomes, and the generation of large amounts of genetic information, or gene sequence data, have led researchers to seek to understand which genes among the decoded sequences may be expressed at any given time, and how networks of genes may work together to produce a biological condition or function. Researchers determine which genes are expressed, and in what magnitude, by measuring levels of selected RNA or proteins that may be present in a biological sample. The desire to map and interpret gene expression patterns has led to demand for technologies that can precisely and efficiently measure the expression level of hundreds of genes simultaneously.
Demand for these new or improved technologies has been driven by researchers in areas such as cancer, immunology, neurology and infectious disease. Researchers in these fields are increasingly attempting to determine which sequences of genes or mutations are important in disease-related biological pathways so new potential treatments might be developed. For example, in the field of cancer, researchers and clinicians have learned that cancer cell behavior is impacted by multiple genes and that analysis of these factors together may be important in determining whether or not a cancer might be responsive to a certain treatment. In addition, more cancers are being detected earlier and tumor samples are becoming smaller and smaller. Tumor samples are often stored in FFPE format, a process whereby biological samples are able to be preserved for long time periods but which can complicate subsequent analysis of genetic material. Researchers and clinicians may face similar challenges with analysis of biological samples in other therapeutic areas of interest.
Our nCounter platform, which was commercially launched in 2008, is used to conduct what is known as bulk gene expression analysis, whereby biological samples are first reduced, or broken down, and then gene expression, specifically quantities of selected RNA or proteins, are measured at their average levels throughout the totality of the sample. nCounter can be used to analyze the activity of up to 800 genes in a single experiment.
GeoMx DSP, which was commercially launched in 2019, is a pioneering product platform in the emerging field of spatial biology. While nCounter and other common gene expression analysis technologies use bulk analysis approaches, 
GeoMx DSP is used to analyze selected regions of an intact biological sample without the need to break down the sample, enabling researchers to see how gene expression might vary across those regions. After a researcher selects regions of interest, GeoMx arranges the biological information extracted from these regions to be subsequently quantified and analyzed, or “read out,” by a platform such as nCounter, whereby researchers can obtain information on up to 96 biological targets per selected region of interest, or by a next generation sequencer, or NGS, system, such as systems manufactured by Illumina, Inc., whereby researchers can obtain information on up to approximately 18,000 biological targets, or the RNA from every gene in the genome, per selected region of interest.
CosMx SMI, which was commercially launched in December 2022, is a new product platform in the field of spatial biology and complements our GeoMx DSP. While GeoMx offers researchers the ability to profile gene expression activity in a selected region of interest that may contain multiple cells or cell types, CosMx is designed to enable multiplexed spatial profiling of RNA and protein targets at a single and sub-cellular resolution level. While GeoMx allows for more rapid, higher throughput analysis of gene expression activity in selected regions of interest, CosMx is designed to allow researchers to “drill down” into a specific single cell or sub-cellular area in a region of interest to gather more information as desired or required. CosMx can be used to analyze up to 1,010 RNA targets, or up to 68 protein targets, at a single or sub-cellular level of resolution within morphologically intact tissue samples, and is expected after further product development to have the ability to analyze up to 6,000 RNA targets, or up to 120 protein targets.
AtoMx SIP, which was commercially launched in December 2022, is a new a cloud-based, open source spatial biology informatics platform, initially for use with CosMx, and eventually also with GeoMx. Researchers’ desire for ever larger amounts of data in their spatial biology experiments has led to significant “big data” management issues, including the ability to store, access and efficiently analyze experimental data at a reasonable cost. AtoMx is designed to take advantage of significant advances in cloud computing and facilitate the easy storage of large data sets and images generated by spatial biology experiments. AtoMx also enables researchers to perform image analysis and data visualization, as well as sharing of data and analysis with collaborators, using scalable and on-demand cloud computing. We believe AtoMx will enable researchers to easily and quickly analyze the substantial scientific data and tissue images generated by spatial biology experiments, while avoiding the large computing infrastructure and security costs associated with operating in-house data centers. AtoMx is currently available to researchers using CosMx, and is expected to be made available for GeoMx users by the end of 2023.
We market and sell our systems and related consumables to researchers in academic, government and biopharmaceutical laboratories for research use, both through our direct sales force and through selected distributors in certain international markets. As of December 31, 2022, we had an installed base of approximately 350 GeoMx DSP systems, which our customers have used to publish approximately 190 peer-reviewed scientific papers.

Industry
Every living organism has a genome that contains a full set of biological instructions required to build and maintain life. A gene is a specific set of instructions embedded in the DNA of a cell. For a gene to be “turned on,” or “expressed,” the cell must first transcribe a copy of its DNA code, or sequence, into molecules of messenger RNA. Then, the cell translates the expressed information contained in RNA into proteins that control most biological processes. In addition to the translated RNAs, there are many types of non-coding RNAs that are involved in many cellular processes and the control of gene expression, including microRNA, or miRNA.
By analyzing the variations in genomes, genes, gene activity or expression and proteins in and between organisms, researchers can determine their functions and roles in health and disease. An improved understanding of the genome and its functions allows researchers to drive advancements in scientific discovery. As they make scientific discoveries, researchers have been able to translate some of these findings into clinical applications that improve patient care.
Biological pathways are the networks of tens or hundreds of genes that work together to produce a biological function. Understanding the activation state of pathways and disruptions in individual elements provides significant insight into the fundamental basis of health and disease and facilitates data driven treatment decisions. As a result, pathway-based biology has become a widely adopted paradigm that researchers use to understand biological processes and has assisted them in the development of diagnostic tests and drugs to treat disease.
Understanding biological pathways has become particularly important in cancer research and treatment. Cancer is a disease generally caused by genetic mutations in cells. The behavior of cancer cells is extremely complex and depends on the activity of many different genes and proteins. It is often impossible for researchers to identify a single gene or protein that adequately predicts a more or less aggressive type of cancer. In some cases, researchers have been able to identify more or less aggressive types of cancer through gene expression analysis of biological pathways, enabling oncologists to determine which specific treatments are most likely to be effective for an individual patient, monitor a patient’s response to those treatments and determine the likelihood of recurrence. Cancer researchers, in part based on their research of biological pathways and gene expression, have begun to demonstrate the potential of harnessing a patient’s immune system to fight cancer. A new class of therapeutics, referred to generally as immuno-oncology drugs, have begun to come to market with the promise of long-term remissions, or even cures, in certain types of cancer.
As interest in understanding biological pathways that may be relevant to medicine has increased, academic, government and biopharmaceutical company researchers have aspired to perform analyses of a larger number of genes and samples and are seeking new methods of interrogation that would allow them to:
•increase the number of molecular targets that can be analyzed simultaneously in order to understand the complete biological pathway involving multiple genes;
•analyze the activity of genes within the existing structural integrity, or spatial orientation, of a biological sample;
•provide more reliable, precise and reproducible data about targeted genes and biological pathways;
•maximize the amount of biologic information extracted from precious tissue or other biological samples;
•minimize the computational intensity of complex genomic and proteomic analysis;
•process difficult-to-work-with specimens, such as tumor biopsies stored in FFPE format;
•improve the overall efficiency of their laboratories by simplifying workflow and accelerating the rate of successfully completing their research; and
•create more systematic and reliable ways to help transition their research discoveries into future clinical products.
The interest in new methods of interrogation has led to the development of new research technologies. Certain technologies that have been rapidly adopted by researchers have focused primarily on determining the sequence of a person’s or organism’s DNA, in order to assess how differences among individuals might be predictive of health or disease. In particular, a technology known as next generation sequencing, or NGS, has become widely adopted. In recent years NGS use has 
accelerated, as the technology has improved and the cost to sequence DNA using NGS has declined. As of December 31, 2022, there were more than 23,000 Illumina NGS systems installed in laboratories globally.
While NGS has revolutionized researchers’ ability to generate gene sequence data rapidly and cost effectively on large numbers of biological samples, other aspects of examining biological pathways are often still done using legacy techniques or new technologies that have proved less capable of providing multiplexed experimentation, ease of use and low cost. Together with determining a gene sequence via NGS, pathway-based research requires further analysis of the activity of multiple genes and small changes in their expression, or of how gene expression may vary depending on where certain cells are situated within biological tissue, which can be challenging for traditional scientific tools.
Researchers interested in multiplex gene expression or biological pathway analysis have traditionally performed experiments using microarrays or quantitative polymerase chain reaction, or qPCR, and protein expression experiments using flow cytometry, mass spectrometry, immunohistochemistry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, assays. Many of these techniques have been available for decades, and while suitable for analyzing the expression of a smaller number of genes, may not be cost effective or scalable enough to study biological pathways. While these types of experiments could be repeated to analyze expression of multiple genes, they are often destructive of biological samples, creating limitations given the amounts of biological sample that may be available. Many of these methods, known as “bulk” biology or “grind and bind,” also destroy the spatial integrity of the sample, eliminating any potential analysis of differences in how genes may be expressed based on where a cell or cells are situated in tissue, or how they may be interacting with other cells or biological functions. These types of experiments may also involve library preparation and amplification steps that can be cumbersome or time consuming or that may introduce the possibility of measurement errors.
More recently, RNA sequencing, or RNA-Seq, which is done using NGS technology, has enabled researchers to look at the entirety of the gene expression within a single sample. However, NGS systems have a more complex and time-consuming workflow than traditional methods of analyzing gene or protein expression, and RNA-Seq generates large amounts of data that may be expensive to store and may not have relevance to the scientific question being explored.
In both life sciences research and clinical medicine, there is a growing need for improved technologies that can easily, precisely and rapidly measure the activation state of hundreds to thousands of genes simultaneously across a large number of precious samples. Furthermore, there is an emerging desire for technologies that could enable researchers and clinicians to understand gene expression activity in tissue as it is naturally situated in the body, without the need to destroy the structure of the biological sample, in order to see if gene activity might vary depending on how, or where, cells are resident in the sample.
Our Strategy and Solutions
Our strategy is to offer a portfolio of technologies to genomics and proteomics researchers that are easy to use across multiple experimental scales or approaches, and that offer consistent, accurate and reproduceable scientific results in a variety of biological sample types, including those that may be more challenging to use or analyze with alternative technology platforms. Our proprietary chemistries and product platforms offer a number of specific advantages, including:
•Complementary solutions that enable spatial biology and bulk gene expression analysis at multiple scales. Genomics and proteomics science has evolved to where experiments can involve studying gene expression from just a handful of data points from up to thousands of genes at a time, and may involve different types of analysis, such as bulk or spatial analysis or quantifying RNA or proteins. Our spatial biology platforms, which enable researchers to analyze intact biological samples, enable the analysis of multiple genes in a single experiment, at various scales. Our GeoMx DSP enables multiplex profiling of intact biological samples of up to approximately 18,000 RNA targets and up to approximately 100 protein targets in selected regions of scientific interest, at multicellular resolution. Our CosMx SMI offers the ability to analyze up to 1,000 RNA targets and up to 68 protein targets in specifically selected regions of a biological sample at single cell or sub-cellular resolution. nCounter, our bulk gene expression analysis solution, can profile the activity of up to 800 genes in a single experiment on multiple biological samples per day, with fewer experimental steps as compared to other multiplex bulk gene expression analysis technologies. We believe the breadth of the spatial biology and bulk gene expression research applications offered by our product platforms may provide our customers with a complete solution for their laboratories, as well as consistency of platform features, usability and performance.
•Ease of use and automation. Spatial biology and gene expression research requires the extraction and analysis of large amounts of data, often from studies comprising hundreds of biological samples, which can make manual or non-automated experimental approaches cumbersome, labor intensive or expensive. Our product platforms are designed to offer minimal sample preparation and automated workflow, which enables the simultaneous analysis of up to 
thousands of genes and hundreds of proteins and to do so in large numbers of biological samples, which would be challenging using manual experimental approaches.
•Flexible and Efficient Biological Sample Requirements. Some biological samples, such as FFPE samples, can be challenging for scientists to work with, as the storage medium can make it difficult to extract gene expression information, or may partially degrade RNA or protein present in a sample. Biological samples may also be shared across multiple researchers, offering advantages to platforms that are able to work with smaller sample amounts. Our systems are designed to unlock biologic information from minute amounts of a variety of challenging tissue samples, including FFPE samples, cell lysates and single cells, which may be important in settings where samples are used across multiple researchers and experiments, such as pharmaceutical product development.
•Robust and reproduceable scientific results. Some chemistries used in spatial biology and bulk gene expression analysis have error rates that may lead to inconsistent data across the same or similar biological samples. Our chemistries hybridize directly to target molecules in a biological sample, which allows target molecules to be counted with high accuracy. Our approaches generate digital information (1 molecule = 1 count) which provides consistent and accurate data with excellent reproducibility, even in biological samples that can be challenging to work with, offering confidence for scientists preparing scientific studies for publication or utilizing results to understand the outcomes of pharmaceutical clinical trials.
Our Products and Technology
Our products operate in the spatial biology and bulk gene expression markets, which exist within the larger life sciences technologies market. 
Our ecosystem of spatial biology solutions, which include our GeoMx DSP, CosMx SMI and AtoMx SIP, are designed to seamlessly work together and address researcher needs across both the discovery and translational research markets. 
nCounter, our first commercially available product, was launched in 2008 and operates within the multi-plex bulk gene expression market and primarily serves the clinical, or translational, research market, often in connection with pharmaceutical product development and human clinical trials of potential new therapies. Our nCounter systems can be used for research or clinical diagnostic applications.
Spatial Biology
GeoMx DSP
Our GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, or “GeoMx DSP” or “GeoMx”, which was made commercially available in 2019, is a pioneering product in the emerging field of spatial biology. nCounter and many other existing gene expression analysis technologies typically assess the average gene expression throughout the totality of a biological sample using sample reduction, or “bulk” or “grind and bind” approaches. GeoMx is designed to allow researchers to explore and quantify how the expression of large numbers of genes vary in different selected regions of interest across the landscape of a heterogeneous biological sample, retaining spatial information and providing assays that target different regions in the same sample.

—————
The left image is the GeoMx DSP instrument, the middle image is a sample of regions of interest, or ROIs, in a biological sample that have been selected by a researcher using GeoMx DSP for further analysis, and the right image is a “volcano plot” comparing the differential gene expression across regions within the biological sample.
The primary technologies historically used by researchers and clinicians to analyze gene activity in selected parts of a biological sample include immunohistochemistry, or IHC, which is used to estimate amounts of protein, and in-situ hybridization, or ISH, which is used to estimate amounts of RNA. Both IHC and ISH use fluorescent stains that provide the ability to identify typically four proteins or RNA at a time based on assigned colors. The colors aid researchers in identifying where certain proteins or RNA may reside in a sample and provide a visual approximation of amounts. These techniques are generally limited however in their ability to only look at a small number of proteins or RNA at a time and offer no ability to precisely quantify the amounts present in any given region or cell type. These limitations may lead to incomplete scientific conclusions as to the most relevant biological pathways in any given sample.
GeoMx is designed to allow researchers to quantify a much larger number of RNA or proteins spatially within multiple regions of interest across the landscape of a heterogeneous section of a biological sample. Our GeoMx instrument images slide-mounted or freshly cut sample sections, allowing users to select regions of interest for subsequent quantification and analysis, or molecular profiling. The post-selection profiling or “read out,” can be performed using either our nCounter Analysis System, or an Illumina NGS system. 
We believe GeoMx offers a number of advantages as compared to traditional spatial technologies, including the ability to profile both RNA and protein, the ability to multiplex large numbers of different RNA or proteins simultaneously in each selected region, flexibility on the selection of regions to analyze, and the ability to process 10 or more biological samples per day.
When GeoMx was first made commercially available, researchers were only able to read out information on up to 96 biological targets from each of their GeoMx-selected regions of interest using nCounter. In August 2020, we added software capabilities and consumables which enabled GeoMx region of interest data to be read out using Illumina NGS systems, which significantly expanded the number of biological targets researchers could analyze in selected regions. In 2021, our Whole Transcriptome Atlas, or WTA, became commercially available and further expanded the number of biological targets in a GeoMx region of interest that may be read out on NGS systems to approximately 18,000 RNAs. Linking GeoMx with NGS also significantly expands our total potential market opportunity. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 23,000 Illumina NGS systems installed globally.
GeoMx DSP Instrument and Software
Our GeoMx DSP instrument uses specialized optics to image slide-mounted biopsies that have been prepared using our GeoMx DSP consumable reagents, as well as with IHC or ISH technology typically available in research or commercial laboratories. GeoMx DSP then allows a researcher to select regions of interest for analysis on screen, and then prepares samples from the selected regions of interest for molecular profiling. Like nCounter, GeoMx is capable of supporting applications including gene expression and protein expression. GeoMx is fully automated and easy to use, requiring only 30 minutes of hands-on time per run and offering the ability to process up to 10 slides per day and is therefore ideal for a range of applications requiring efficient, high-precision, simultaneous quantitation of large numbers of target molecules across a set of biological samples.
The GeoMx software enables the integration of the four color images acquired and the corresponding digital counts of the levels of RNA or protein as acquired using our nCounter Analysis System, or an Illumina NGS system. The GeoMx data center uniquely combines system control to visualize whole sample images at single cell resolution with automated or manual region of interest selection. The fully integrated workflow provides tracking of image data and corresponding profiling data, allowing users to easily go from data collection to data analysis. In addition to our internally developed software, in 2020 we announced a collaboration with Illumina, whereby we have developed a GeoMx application powered by Illumina’s DRAGEN Bio-IT platform in order to facilitate the analysis of data generated by our customers using NGS read out on Illumina systems.
GeoMx DSP Consumables
Our current portfolio of GeoMx DSP consumables focuses on RNA and protein profiling for immunology, immuno-oncology and neurobiology applications, targeted either for nCounter read out where a set of genes and a biological pathway may be better understood for more targeted experiments, or for NGS read-out in basic discovery applications where significantly greater numbers of genes may be of interest. GeoMx consumable products are currently designed as standardized panel products that represent important content for certain disease areas with an option for researchers to add customized content to that panel depending on the area of interest or desired number of targets for analysis. Our GeoMx assays generate high-quality results from challenging sample types, including FFPE and crude cell lysates.
Our significant GeoMx consumable products include: 
Enabled for nCounter readout
•Immuno-Oncology Panels. An immuno-oncology-focused panel menu that comprises up to 96 protein and RNA targets for analyzing the tumor and tumor microenvironment compartments in human and mouse biological samples. The standard, or core, panel offering is comprised of 18 targets, and researchers have the option of adding over 30 additional targets for analysis focused on specific applications such as immuno-oncology drug target proteins, or human immune activation proteins, and 23 additional targets for analyzing mouse samples for pre-clinical applications. In addition, we offer RNA panel content to allow for the analysis of up to 84 targets for human immune pathways.
•Neurobiology Panels. A neurobiology-focused menu that comprises up to 40 protein targets to profile human neural cells. The standard, or core, panel offering comprises 20 targets, and researchers have the option of adding up to 20 additional targets for analysis focused on specific applications such as proteins implicated in Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease.
Enabled for NGS readout
Targeted:
•Cancer Transcriptome Atlas (CTA). An oncology and immuno-oncology focused panel was the first commercial GeoMx product to enable read out using NGS. The CTA allows for a nearly 20-fold increase in RNA targets that may be profiled as compared to GeoMx RNA panels designed for nCounter read out, providing a high-resolution spatial view of cancer biology. The CTA includes more than 1,800 genes that cover over 100 pathways critical to understanding tumor biology, the immune response and the tumor microenvironment. Biological content can be further customized with the addition of up to 60 user defined targets. The CTA panel is compatible with both fresh frozen and FFPE-embedded biological samples, allowing scientists to work with a broad spectrum of samples in their research. As part of a full end-to-end solution, we are providing library preparation reagents and NGS readout, a bioinformatics pipeline that links high-resolution, full-slide images generated on GeoMx with the massively parallel output of Illumina sequencers.
Universal:
•Protein Assays. The currently available content covers applications in immuno-oncology and future content releases are planned to cover immunology and neuroscience. These assays will provide GeoMx CTA and WTA users complementary protein content designed for NGS read out. These new protein assays have been tested for performance on both fresh frozen and FFPE-embedded biological samples. Our GeoMx Protein Assays for NGS readout expanded the protein capabilities of GeoMx from tens to now hundreds of validated proteins to be analyzed from a single sample section with spatial resolution. 
•Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA). The WTA, a GeoMx consumable product that became commercially available for use in human and mouse biological samples during 2021, is a universal panel that provides an unbiased, spatial view of approximately 18,000 RNA targets and is designed to be read out using NGS. The WTA unlocks new pathways to be explored by researchers and is designed to broaden GeoMx RNA profiling from oncology and immunology to include neuroscience, developmental biology and other diverse fields. The WTA assay provides robust and sensitive performance both fresh frozen and FFPE-embedded biological samples, allowing scientists to work with a broad spectrum of samples in their research. WTA utilizes the same workflow and chemistry as our CTA. 
CosMx SMI
Our CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager, or “CosMx SMI” or “CosMx”, which was made commercially available in December 2022, is designed to combine the spatial profiling of a large number of biological targets with high-resolution imaging, which will allow researchers to both analytically measure as well as visualize the activity of selected RNA or proteins at the single cell or sub-cellular level. CosMx SMI enables the analysis of up to 1,000 RNA targets or up to 68 protein targets directly from single cells within morphologically intact biological samples and is expected, after further development, to enable the analysis of up to 6,000 RNA targets or up to 120 protein targets. CosMx SMI offers researchers the opportunity to “drill down” further into regions of interest in biological samples, as a complement to our GeoMx DSP which typically offers gene expression profiling across regions containing multiple cells.
CosMx SMI incorporates a proprietary version of our chemistry that was originally developed as part of our concluded collaboration with Lam Research, whereby we modified our core nCounter chemistry to be utilized in a NGS sequencing platform and related assays. Upon the conclusion of our Lam collaboration, in 2020 we began exploring applications for this newly developed chemistry in spatial biology, specifically whether we could conduct spatial analysis of increasingly smaller regions of interest, down to the individual cell and potentially sub-cellular level. Upon completing proof of principle research and development, we announced the expected development and commercialization timeline for CosMx SMI in December 2020.

The left image is the CosMx SMI instrument, the middle image is a single-cell expression map of selected genes and the right image is a spatially-resolved cell type map in a biological sample.
Biology takes place on several spatial scales including multi-cellular, single cell and sub-cellular levels. GeoMx DSP enables multi-cellular analysis at the whole transcriptome level to elucidate the behavior of populations of cells, such as those within a tumor or the tumor microenvironment. We have designed CosMx SMI to address the unmet need for high-plex spatial analysis at single cell and sub-cellular resolution, which may be ideally suited for targeted applications such as creating cell atlases or studying cell-cell interactions. Our GeoMx DSP and CosMx SMI platforms are designed to be synergistic, creating a spatial biology portfolio that spans the continuum from targeted to whole transcriptome analysis, and from multicellular resolution down to single cell and sub cellular applications.
We believe CosMx SMI offers a number of advantages as compared to competing imager platforms, including the ability to profile a high number of selected targets or “high plex”, a larger sample scan area of up to 300 square millimeters, a tunable throughput that allows researchers to process between 2 to 20 samples per week depending on the number of targets selected for study, and the ability to store, manage, analyze and share data from the large data sets generated in a cloud-based informatics environment.
CosMx SMI Instrument and Software
Our CosMx SMI instrument uses specialized optics to perform high-plex analysis at cellular and subcellular resolution of slide-mounted FFPE and fresh frozen, or FF, tissue samples which have been prepared using CosMx Assay Consumables. CosMx SMI allows researchers to select specific fields of view, or FOVs, up to 300 square millimeters and then uses an integrated readout to enable visualization of up to 1,000 RNA, or up to 68 protein targets. Like nCounter and GeoMx DSP, CosMx SMI is capable of supporting applications including gene expression and protein expression. The CosMx SMI uses standard histology workflows and features semi-automated options to reduce hands-on time per run. CosMx SMI workflows and integrated readout enable researchers to process up to 2 slides per week for 1000-plex RNA assays covering 100 mm2 tissue area or up to 7 slides per week for 68-plex Protein assays covering 100 mm2 tissue area.
CosMx SMI uses multi-modal cell segmentation to provide accurate cell boundary detection. This cell segmentation process uses cell membrane and protein morphology images, a machine-learning augmented cell segmentation algorithm and transcript-based segmentation refinement to achieve precise single-cell segmentation results from intact tissue. AtoMx SIP is the supported software platform for CosMx SMI. CosMx SMI is designed to seamlessly export data to AtoMx SIP to enable researchers to visualize, analyze and perform enhanced bioinformatic workflows on their collected results.

AtoMx SIP
Our AtoMx Spatial Informatics Platform, or “AtoMx SIP” or “AtoMx”, is a cloud-based, open source and fully integrated informatics solution for spatial biology. AtoMx, which was commercially launched in December 2022, is initially for use with CosMx, and is expected to be made available for use with GeoMx by the end of 2023.
AtoMx enables users to perform image analysis and data visualization and utilize scalable and on-demand cloud computing and data storage, allowing data sharing to enable global research collaboration. AtoMx provides the secure, scalable storage and analysis that spatial biology researchers need to drive their workflow from study design to peer-reviewed publication. AtoMx stores customer data in a flexible “data lakehouse” structure which can be examined using artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches. A cloud-based platform reduces or eliminates the need for laboratories to invest 
in their own costly informatics infrastructure and reduces spatial biology analysis compute times from days to hours. Users have the flexibility to apply a predefined data analysis pipeline, to customize these pipelines using their own code, and to access open-source tools developed by the bio-informatics community.
Technology Access Program (TAP)
Selected customers can access our GeoMx DSP and CosMx SMI through our in-house Technology Access Program, or TAP, service and may select panels that read out on either nCounter or NGS. Through TAP, customers submit biological samples to our Seattle facilities where they are imaged and profiled using our instruments and once completed, we provide a detailed report, which includes raw data and analyzed results back to the customer. We have successfully utilized TAP prior to and during our GeoMx DSP and CosMx SMI instrument and product commercial launches and believe it may be a leading indicator of potential future commercial demand for our products.
nCounter
Our nCounter Analysis System is an automated, multi-application, digital detection and counting system which directly profiles hundreds of molecules simultaneously, using our proprietary optical barcoding chemistry that is powerful enough for use in research, yet simple enough for use in clinical laboratories. Our nCounter Analysis System is based on automated instruments that prepare and analyze biological samples using proprietary reagents which can only be obtained from us. Our research and clinical laboratory customers purchase instruments from us and then purchase our reagents and related consumables for the specific experiment they wish to conduct and for tests that they intend to run, respectively.
Our nCounter Analysis System is capable of supporting a number of applications including gene expression, protein expression, gene mutation, miRNA expression, copy number variation, gene fusions and molecular diagnostics. We believe our nCounter Analysis System offers a number of advantages, including providing a simpler and faster workflow with minimal hands-on time for multiplex analysis of up to 800 RNA, or protein targets. Additionally, because nCounter is fully automated and easy-to-use, it is ideal for a range of applications requiring efficient, high-precision, simultaneous quantitation of hundreds of target molecules across a set of biological samples. Our nCounter assays generate high-quality results from challenging sample types, including FFPE and crude cell lysates.
nCounter Instruments

—————
The left image is the nCounter Pro system, the middle image is the nCounter FLEX system and the right image is the nCounter SPRINT Profiler system.
We currently offer three versions of our nCounter Analysis System, each targeted at a distinct user segment. Our nCounter Pro is a higher throughput instrument with features appealing to larger core laboratories serving multiple researchers. Our nCounter SPRINT Profiler is designed to appeal to individual researchers running relatively smaller experiments. Our nCounter FLEX, which is targeted toward clinical laboratories, has been 510(k) cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and CE marked by European regulatory authorities. The nCounter FLEX system was designed and is manufactured under ISO 13485:2003, the current quality standard for in vitro diagnostic platforms and medical devices. nCounter FLEX is enabled to run the Prosigna® breast cancer assay, as well as other proprietary or laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, that may be developed. Pursuant to the terms of our License and Asset Purchase Agreement, or LAPA, with Veracyte, Inc., or Veracyte, we granted to Veracyte an exclusive worldwide license to our nCounter FLEX system for in vitro diagnostic use and for the development and commercialization of in vitro diagnostic tests on the nCounter FLEX system and sold to Veracyte certain assets, including our rights with respect to the Prosigna breast cancer assay. For additional information regarding our agreement with Veracyte, see “ — License Agreements — Veracyte, Inc.” below.
The nCounter Pro and FLEX systems comprise a Prep Station and a Digital Analyzer. The Prep Station is the automated liquid handling component that processes and prepares the samples for data collection on the Digital Analyzer. The Digital Analyzer collects data from samples by taking images of the immobilized fluorescent reporters in the sample cartridge and processing the data into output files, which include the target identifier and related count numbers along with a broad set of internal controls that validate the precision of each assay. The nCounter Pro and FLEX throughput can be quadrupled using sample multiplexing for experiments targeting 200 genes or fewer. The nCounter SPRINT Profiler combines the liquid handling steps and the digital analysis through use of a special microfluidic cartridge.

Custom CodeSets
We work with our customers to design and develop custom gene expression CodeSets to enable them to evaluate specific genes that are the subject of their study. Our customers provide us a list of targets for which we subsequently build a unique CodeSet to their specifications. Our design process leverages full length sequences for the RNA molecules that our customers are interested in detecting and prevents cross hybridization to non-target molecules in the sample. The custom CodeSet design process occurs in four distinct steps: (1) the customer selects the genes of interest, (2) we design probes and provide a design report to the customer, (3) the customer reviews and approves the design report and (4) we manufacture, test and ship the CodeSet to the customer. The manufacturing process typically takes from three to five weeks, depending on the number of genes targeted and samples to be processed by the customer.
nCounter Software and Data Analysis
nCounter instrument platforms also include our nSolver Analysis Software and nCounter Advance Analysis add-on to nSolver, providing an integrated data analysis program that offers researchers the ability to quickly and easily quality check, normalize and analyze their data without having to use any additional software for data analysis. The FLEX system, in addition to running any of our research applications, can also be enabled with software that runs Prosigna to generate individualized patient reports.
In May 2020, we announced a collaboration with ROSALIND™ Bioinformatics, a provider of cloud-based genomic analysis tools, for the development of new analysis tools for data generated on our nCounter Analysis System. ROSALIND offers a cloud-based platform that connects researchers to differential expression and pathway exploration in a real-time collaborative environment.
Functionality has been built into ROSALIND’s cloud-based analysis suite that facilitates nCounter data visualization, exploration and collaboration. These new capabilities were offered immediately through early access to COVID-19 researchers performing critical host response studies on our nCounter platform. In 2021, ROSALIND created a unique data analysis solution specific to the nCounter TCR Diversity Panel, which is routinely utilized to profile T-cell receptor variable and constant regions and other T-cell markers, resulting in a TCR Diversity Score. We are working with ROSALIND to make certain features of nSolver available within ROSALIND, and we are evaluating opportunities for joint development of new analysis solutions.
Molecular Diagnostics
Our nCounter Analysis System has the precision, reproducibility and simple workflow required of technologies used in clinical laboratories. We believe the precision, ease of use and flexibility of the nCounter Analysis System may allow medical technicians to conduct complex molecular diagnostic tests with minimal training. 
Clinical laboratory customers use the nCounter Analysis System and our Prosigna breast cancer assay to provide clinical diagnostic services. Prosigna is based on a collection of 50 genes known as the PAM50 gene signature, which was discovered by several of our research customers. Prosigna can provide a breast cancer patient and physician with a subtype classification based on the fundamental biology of the patient’s tumor, as well as a prognostic score that indicates the probability of cancer recurrence over 10 years. Physicians use Prosigna to help guide therapeutic decisions so that patients receive a therapeutic intervention, such as chemotherapy, only if clinically warranted. In September 2013, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market in the United States a version of Prosigna providing a prognostic indicator for distant recurrence-free survival at 10 years. In December 2019, we entered into an exclusive license of nCounter diagnostic assets and rights to Veracyte, Inc., or “Veracyte”. For additional information regarding our agreement with Veracyte, see “ — License Agreements — Veracyte, Inc.” below.
License Agreements
We have relied, and expect to continue to rely, on strategic collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. For example, our molecular barcoding chemistry technology is in-licensed from the Institute for Systems Biology. In addition, we have licensed technology related to our diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, assay from the National Institutes of Health, and we rely on other license and supply arrangements for proprietary components which require us to pay royalties on the sale of our products. Other research customers are using our GeoMx DSP, CosMx SMI and nCounter Analysis System to discover gene expression signatures that we believe could form the basis of future diagnostic products. In the future, we may consider these gene signatures for in-licensing. 
Veracyte, Inc. 
In December 2019, we entered into a LAPA and Service and Supply Agreements, or SSAs, with Veracyte. Pursuant to the LAPA, we completed a license of intellectual property and a sale of certain assets to Veracyte relating to our nCounter FLEX system for use in clinical diagnostic applications. Veracyte also acquired certain intellectual property rights and worldwide distribution rights relating to Prosigna and our LymphMark assay, and certain clinical diagnostic assay software modules that operate with the nCounter FLEX system. Pursuant to the LAPA, we provided Veracyte a worldwide exclusive license to market and sell clinical diagnostic tests developed for our nCounter FLEX platform for in vitro diagnostic use and for the development and commercialization of in vitro diagnostic tests, including in vitro diagnostic devices or laboratory developed tests, for use on the nCounter FLEX platform. In connection with the transaction, Veracyte agreed to assume certain liabilities associated with the assets purchased under the LAPA, including ongoing third-party royalty obligations relating to Prosigna and LymphMark. We also assigned to Veracyte our Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with Bioclassifier, LLC, effective July 7, 2010, as amended, which granted rights to certain intellectual property related to Prosigna. We also entered into a sublicense agreement with Veracyte relating to the Bioclassifier Agreement wherein we obtained certain non-exclusive rights relating to our rights to provide Prosigna to Veracyte on an ongoing basis and for other research or investigational purposes. 
Upon consummation of the LAPA, Veracyte paid us total consideration of $50.0 million, consisting of (i) $40.0 million in cash and (ii) 376,732 shares of Veracyte common stock valued at $10.0 million. Pursuant to the LAPA, we are eligible to receive potential milestone payments of up to $10.0 million in the aggregate, to be paid upon the launch of additional clinical diagnostic tests by Veracyte for our nCounter FLEX platform.
Pursuant to the SSAs, we agreed to supply to Veracyte nCounter FLEX systems, and to manufacture and supply Prosigna kits, LymphMark kits and any additional clinical diagnostic tests that Veracyte may develop in the future for nCounter, for a period of at least four years subsequent to the transaction date. Pursuant to the SSAs, Veracyte will pay the designated transfer prices for nCounter FLEX systems, Prosigna kits, LymphMark kits and any other nCounter-based diagnostic tests developed by Veracyte.
Lam Research Corporation
In August 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Lam Research Corporation, or Lam, to develop a NGS sequencing platform and related assays. Under the terms of the agreement, Lam contributed an aggregate of $50.0 million towards the project. As of December 31, 2019, all committed development funding had been received from Lam, and as of December 31, 2020 all we received had been used in our continued development activities associated with our NGS sequencing platform and related assays. 
All intellectual property made or conceived solely by us pursuant to the collaboration will be owned by us and licensed to Lam solely for the purposes of the collaboration. All intellectual property made or conceived solely by Lam pursuant to the collaboration will be owned by Lam and, subject to certain restrictions on use with Lam competitors, licensed to us for the purposes of the collaboration and further development and commercialization of our products and technologies resulting from the collaboration in the field of molecular profiling. Jointly created intellectual property will be jointly owned, provided that neither we nor Lam use such jointly owned intellectual property in the other party’s competitive field. Lam is eligible to receive certain single-digit percentage royalty payments from us on net sales of certain products and technologies developed under the agreement, if any such net sales are recorded. The maximum amount of royalties we may pay to Lam will be capped at $150.0 million (three times the amount of development funding actually provided by Lam). We retain exclusive rights to obtain regulatory approval, manufacture and commercialize any products.
Institute for Systems Biology
In 2004, we entered into an agreement with the Institute for Systems Biology pursuant to which the Institute granted to us an exclusive, subject to certain government rights, worldwide license, including the right to sublicense, to the digital molecular barcoding technology on which our nCounter Analysis System is based, including 13 patents and patent applications. Pursuant to the terms of the amended license agreement, we are required to pay the Institute for Systems Biology royalties on net sales of products sold by us, or our sublicensees, at a low single digit percentage rate, which was reduced by 50% in the third quarter of 2016 for the remainder of the license term due to the achievement of a cumulative sales threshold. Through December 31, 2022, we have paid aggregate royalties of $8.5 million under the license agreement. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the amended license agreement, the agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire patent licensed to us. The Institute for Systems Biology has the right to terminate the agreement under certain situations, including our failure to meet certain diligence requirements or our uncured material breach of the agreement.
Intellectual Property
We must develop and maintain protection on the proprietary aspects of our technologies in order to remain competitive. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality, material transfer agreements, licenses, invention assignment agreements and other contracts to protect our intellectual property rights.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned or exclusively licensed approximately 38 issued U.S. patents and approximately 21 pending U.S. patent applications, including provisional and non-provisional filings and 5 pre-nationalization PCT applications. We also owned or licensed approximately 312 pending and granted counterpart applications worldwide, including 123 country-specific validations of 17 European patents. The issued U.S. patents that we own or exclusively license are expected to expire between September 3, 2024 and November 21, 2037. We have either sole or joint ownership positions in all of our pending U.S. patent applications. Where we jointly own cases, we typically have negotiated license or assignment provisions to obtain exclusive rights. For our material nCounter Analysis System we are the exclusive licensee. We also generally protect our newly developed intellectual property by entering into confidentiality agreements that include intellectual property assignment clauses with our employees, consultants and collaborators. Our patent applications generally relate to the following main areas: 
•our GeoMx DSP, CosMx SMI, or nCounter Analysis System biology, chemistry, methods, analytics and hardware;
•specific applications for our GeoMx DSP, CosMx SMI, or nCounter Analysis System technology;
•our gene expression markers, methods and gene signatures for recurrence and drug response in certain forms of cancer;
•methods and systems for the processing and analysis of spatial profiling and sequencing data;
•biological and chemical compositions, methods and hardware for enzyme- and amplification- free sequencing; and
•biological and chemical compositions, methods and hardware for multiplexed detection and quantification of protein and/or nucleic acid expression in a defined region of a tissue or cell.
We intend to file additional patent applications in the United States and abroad to strengthen our intellectual property rights; however, our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot assure investors that any patents that have issued or might issue will protect our technology. We have received notices of claims of potential infringement from third parties and may receive additional notices in the future. When appropriate, we have taken a license to the intellectual property rights from such third parties. For additional information, see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
We own a number of trademarks and develop names for our new products and as appropriate secure trademark protection for them, including domain name registration, in relevant jurisdictions.
Research and Development
We have committed, and expect to continue to commit, significant resources to developing new technologies and products, improving product performance and reliability and reducing costs. We are continuously seeking to improve our product platforms, including the technology, software, accessibility and overall capability. We also seek to develop additional research consumable content, new product platforms and new product capabilities. We have assembled experienced research and development teams at our greater Seattle, Washington area facilities with the scientific, engineering, software and process talent that we believe is required to successfully grow our business. As of December 31, 2022, we had 193 employees in research and development.
Sales and Marketing
We began selling nCounter to researchers in 2008, GeoMx DSP in 2019, and CosMx SMI and AtoMx SIP in 2022. We sell our instruments and related products primarily through our own sales force in North America and through a combination of direct and distributor channels in Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and South America. We have agreements with 44 distributors, each of which is specific to a certain territory. In the event a distributor does not meet minimum performance requirements, we may terminate the distribution agreement or convert from an exclusive to non-exclusive arrangement within the territory, allowing us to enter into arrangements with other distributors for the territory. 
For additional information regarding geographic distribution of revenue, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report. 
Our sales and marketing efforts are targeted at department heads, research or clinical laboratory directors, principal investigators, core facility directors and research scientists and pathologists at leading academic institutions, biopharmaceutical companies, publicly and privately-funded research institutions and contract research organizations. We seek to increase awareness of our products among our target customers through direct sales calls, trade shows, seminars, academic conferences, web presence and other forms of internet marketing.
Our instruments require a significant capital investment, and our sales process involves numerous interactions with multiple individuals within an organization, and often includes in-depth analysis by potential customers of our products, performance of proof-of-principle studies, preparation of extensive documentation and a lengthy review process. As a result of these factors, the significant capital investment required in purchasing our instruments and the budget cycles of our customers, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order can vary significantly and be up to 12 months or longer. Given the length and uncertainty of our sales cycle, we have in the past experienced, and likely will in the future experience, fluctuations in our instrument sales on a period-to-period basis.
We have continued to invest in our commercial channel to increase our reach and productivity. For example, in 2022, we reorganized our commercial channel to realign our expanded commercial team, centralize primary points of contact with our customers, and to add roles relating to customer support and experience, given our expanding portfolio of products. We believe these changes and investments help to drive the growth of our installed instrument base, and the utilization of consumables by our installed base of instrument users.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We use third-party contract manufacturers to produce our instruments and certain raw materials for our consumables. We build our consumables at our facilities in the greater Seattle, Washington area. We develop and deliver our cloud-based software applications primarily from facilities and staff located in the greater Seattle area, and we also use certain third party cloud computing service providers for data storage and the hosting of software applications we offer to customers.
Instruments
We outsource manufacturing of our instruments. Precision System Science, Co., Ltd. of Chiba, Japan, or PSS, is our sole source supplier for the nCounter Prep Station. Korvis Automation Inc., or Korvis, is our sole source supplier for our nCounter Digital Analyzers and our GeoMx DSP instrument at its facility in Corvallis, Oregon. Paramit Corporation, or Paramit, is our sole source supplier for our nCounter SPRINT Profiler at its facility in Morgan Hill, California. D&K Engineering, Inc. of San Diego, California is our sole source supplier of our CosMx SMI instrument.
The facilities at which our instruments are built have been certified to ISO 13485:2003 standards. Our contracts with these instrument suppliers do not commit them to carry inventory or make available any particular quantities. Under the terms of our instrument supply agreements, we are required to place binding purchase orders for instruments that will be delivered to us by the supplier from the date of placement of the purchase order. Although qualifying alternative third-party manufacturers could be time consuming and expensive, our instruments’ design is similar to that of other instruments and we believe that alternatives would be available if necessary. However, if our instrument suppliers terminate our relationship with them or if they give other customers’ needs higher priority than ours, then we may not be able to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms.
Consumables
We manufacture our consumables in our greater Seattle, Washington area facilities, certain of which have been certified to ISO 13485:2003 standards. In the past several years, we have expanded our manufacturing capacity through additional leased space as well as by relocating certain research and development functions and converting the space to incremental manufacturing labs and offices. In the future, should additional space become necessary, we believe that there will be space available near our existing facilities, however we cannot predict that this space will be available if and when it is needed.
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components and materials used in the manufacture of our consumables. Some of these components are sourced from a single supplier. For example, Cidra Precision Services, LLC, of Wallingford, Connecticut, part of IDEX Health & Science, is the sole supplier of the microfluidic cartridge for our nCounter SPRINT Profiler. For some components, we have qualified second sources for several of our critical reagents, including oligonucleotides, adhesives and dyes. We believe that having dual sources for our components helps reduce the risk of a production delay caused by a disruption in the supply of a critical component. We continue to pursue qualifying additional suppliers, but cannot predict how expensive, time-consuming or successful these efforts will be. If we were to lose one or more of our suppliers, it may take significant time and effort to qualify alternative suppliers.
Software
We develop, deliver and manage our cloud-based AtoMx SIP primarily from facilities located in the greater Seattle, Washington area. In the past several years, we have expanded our information technology engineering, data management and monitoring capabilities to support the launch of AtoMx, including establishing a Network Operations Center in our greater Seattle facilities.
We currently rely on certain outside software development firms to support the development and updating of AtoMx, as well as certain third party cloud computing providers for data storage and hosting. While we currently host AtoMx with a single third party cloud computing vendor, AtoMx is designed to function across multiple third party cloud computing platforms, which we believe reduces the risk of exposure to a single vendor and facilitates the management of cloud computing costs. We continuously assess and qualify additional outside software development firms and third party cloud computing providers, however if we elected or were required to work with additional vendors, we cannot predict how expensive, time consuming or successful these efforts will be. If we were to lose one of our key vendors, it may take significant time and effort to qualify alternative vendors.
Competition
In the life sciences research market, we compete with companies such as Agilent Technologies, Akoya Biosciences, Bio-Rad, Bio-Techne, Standard BioTools (previously Fluidigm), Illumina, Qiagen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vizgen and 10x Genomics. These competitors and others have products for gene and protein expression analysis and spatial biology that compete in certain segments of the market in which we sell our products. In addition, there are a number of new market entrants in the process of developing novel technologies for the life sciences market, including those that may compete with GeoMx, CosMx or AtoMx.
We believe that we have multiple competitive advantages, including the automated nature of our systems with simple, rapid and efficient workflow that requires limited human intervention or labor; the multiplexing capability of our technologies to analyze more target molecules in a single experiment; the ability to analyze both RNA and proteins; compatibility with many sample types, including difficult samples such as FFPE; and the ability to analyze small sample inputs, in some cases down to a single cell, from a wide variety of sample types.
While we believe that we compete favorably based on the factors described above, many of our competitors enjoy other competitive advantages over us, including:
•greater name and brand recognition, financial and human resources;
•broader product lines;
•larger sales forces and more established distributor networks;
•substantial intellectual property portfolios;
•larger and more established customer bases and relationships; and
•better established, larger scale and lower cost manufacturing capabilities.
For additional information, see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors - The life sciences research market is highly competitive. If we fail to compete effectively, our business and operating results will suffer.”
Human Capital
Our employees are guided by our mission to map the universe of biology. Our core values of grit, authenticity, ambition, ingenuity and commitment to customers serve to guide us on our path toward achieving our mission. Our core values set the foundation for our attitudes and actions, how we conduct our business, interact with each other and our customers and evaluate employee performance. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 703 employees, of which 193 work in manufacturing, 234 in sales, marketing and business development, 193 in research and development and 83 in general and administrative. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2022, of our 703 employees, 603 were employed in the United States and 100 were employed outside the United States.
Talent Acquisition and Development and Employee Engagement
Our employees play a key role in our ability to serve our customers and achieve our mission and we strive to attract, empower and retain high quality talent that is inspired, diverse and driven. To attract and retain top talent, we strive to create opportunities for our employees to grow and develop their careers and ensure they are supported by competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits program. 
We believe employee career development is an investment in our employees’ skills and our future. We offer career development opportunities such as educational reimbursement, onsite training to enhance job-related skills, management development programs and opportunities to attend job related conferences and seminars. Additionally, we have an annual formal employee review program which standardizes performance evaluation across all areas in the organization and aids in supporting our employees’ career and personal development, which ultimately contributes to achieving our mission. 
We believe it is important to encourage open and direct communication at all levels in our organization and we regularly use employee experience and feedback surveys to understand whether our human capital policies are effective and where we can improve.
Compensation and Benefits
We believe we provide competitive and comprehensive financial compensation and benefits for our employees and our programs are designed to meet our employees’ needs. In addition to salaries, these programs (which may vary by country or region) include new employee equity grants, additional discretionary equity awards, including a discretionary annual equity grant, discretionary merit-based annual bonuses, a voluntary employee stock purchase program, a 401(k) plan which includes partial employer matching contributions, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, flexible paid time off, family leave, employee assistance programs, an educational reimbursement program and health and wellness programs. In addition, we believe our employees can make a meaningful difference in their local communities and we offer all employees paid time off to volunteer in community involvement activities of their choice.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe racism and discrimination are unacceptable. We are committed to building and maintaining a diverse and inclusive business and have diversity, equity and inclusion programs in place to help us achieve our commitment. 
We seek diversity, equity and inclusion at every level in our organization. Our board of directors includes directors from various backgrounds, industries, skills and experience. In 2021, we added two new members with diverse backgrounds to our board of directors. Our board of directors includes four women and five men. Our senior leadership team includes leaders with diverse skills, experiences, backgrounds and genders. Our employees come from numerous countries and various backgrounds and we strive to provide a diverse and inclusive environment.
We have active programs in place and continue to focus on extending our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. As part of our program, we seek to make diversity, equity and inclusion a focus for our recruiting and hiring practices, including by ensuring we have diverse representations in our recruiting pool and interview panel. To further our commitment to create an inclusive and diverse culture, we engaged a third-party diversity, equity and inclusion consultant to assist us in our commitment.
We currently have three employee resource groups, or ERGs, that focus on communities including women, people of color and LGBTQ+. We believe these ERGs are guided by our priorities and values and provide a way for employees with common interests to connect, obtain professional development and participate in community outreach opportunities. We may expand our ERG offerings in the future.
In 2020, we joined Washington Employers for Racial Equity, or WERE, which is a new statewide coalition dedicated to racial equity and opportunity for all. As a coalition member, we have signed a Commitment to Progress, committing to own our part of the problem and setting specific improvement goals. As members of the coalition, we will listen, learn, partner, invest and work toward solutions in our own company and our communities.
Government Regulation of Products
RUO Products
United States
Research Use Only, or RUO, products are not medical devices and are therefore not subject to the quality system regulation, or QSR, and other medical device requirements enforced by the FDA. FDA regulations state that an RUO product must be labeled “For Research Use Only. Not for Use in Diagnostic Procedures.” Manufacturers of RUO products may not represent an RUO product as safe or effective for any clinical purpose and may not provide technical support to clinical 
laboratories on using an RUO product for clinical laboratory testing. In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance on products labeled RUO, which, among other things, reaffirmed FDA’s position that a company may not make any clinical or diagnostic claims about an RUO product, and also stating that merely including an RUO labeling statement will not necessarily render the device exempt from the FDA’s clearance, approval, or other regulatory requirements if FDA concludes that the totality of circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicates that the manufacturer’s objective intent is that the product be used for diagnostic purposes. These circumstances may include, among other things, written or verbal marketing claims regarding a product’s performance in clinical diagnostic applications and a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for such activities.
In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance on products labeled RUO. The guidance reaffirmed FDA’s position that a company may not make any clinical or diagnostic claims about an RUO-labeled product and also stated that merely including a labeling statement that the product is for research purposes only and is not for use in diagnostic procedures will not necessarily render the device exempt from the FDA’s clearance, approval, or other regulatory requirements if FDA concludes that the totality of circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicates that the manufacturer’s objective intent is that the product be used for diagnostic purposes. These circumstances may include, among other things, written or verbal marketing claims regarding a product’s performance in clinical diagnostic applications and a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for such activities.
Our GeoMx DSP, CosMx SMI, nCounter Pro Analysis System and nCounter SPRINT Profiler are currently labeled and sold for research use only, or RUO, and we sell them to academic institutions, life sciences and clinical research laboratories, and biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for non-diagnostic purposes. These products are not intended or promoted for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, and they are labeled “For research use only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures,” in accordance with FDA regulations for RUO products. Accordingly, they are not medical devices subject to FDA regulation because they do not have the requisite intended use, and they therefore do not need to comply with pre- and post-market controls or other FDA requirements. Violation of any FDA regulatory requirements could result in regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, or fines, among other adverse actions.
If the FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that our products labeled and marketed as RUO are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be subject to FDA regulation as medical devices, which could include obtaining premarket authorization (510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or pre-market approval, or PMA, prior to commercialization. Further, sales of devices for diagnostic purposes may subject us to additional healthcare regulation. We continue to monitor the changing legal and regulatory landscape to ensure our compliance with any applicable laws and regulations.
In some cases, our customers may use our RUO products in their own laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, or in other FDA-regulated products for clinical diagnostic use. The FDA has historically exercised discretion (i.e., has not enforced) the medical device regulations against clinical laboratories with respect to most LDTs. The FDA has indicated that it may seek to increase its regulation of LDTs. Any future rulemaking, guidance, or other oversight of LDTs and clinical laboratories that develop and perform them by FDA, if and when finalized, may impact the sales of our products and how customers use our products, and may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws.
If we wish to label and market our RUO products for use in performing clinical diagnostics, they would be subject to FDA regulation as in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, medical devices, and subject to applicable requirements for IVD devices. Unless an exemption applies, we would be required to obtain either prior 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA from the FDA before commercializing the product. International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country.
International
Our RUO products are not subject to regulation in the European Union, or EU, under the In Vitro Diagnostics Directive (98/79/EC), or IVDD, or the IVDR. Outside of the EU, regulations vary but generally our RUO products do not require regulatory approval. If we wish to label and market our RUO products for use in performing clinical diagnostics outside the US, they could be subject to regulation as IVD medical devices. In the EU, they would be subject to compliance with the in vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/746, or IVDR. Outside of the EU, regulatory approval needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order to market medical devices. Regulations in each country may vary substantially which can affect timelines of introduction.
Medical Devices
United States
In the United States, medical devices, including in vitro diagnostics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, medical device development, testing, labeling, storage, premarket clearance or approval, advertising and promotion and product sales and distribution.
The FDC Act defines a medical device as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component part or accessory, which is (1) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or (2) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. IVDs are a type of medical device, and include tests that can be used in the screening or diagnosis and/or detection of diseases or conditions, including, without limitation, the presence of certain chemicals, genetic markers, infections, or other biomarkers.
The FDC Act generally applies a risk-based framework to medical devices, including IVDs. Class I (low risk) devices are those for which general controls – which include registration, listing, medical device reporting, corrections and removals, and compliance with applicable provisions of QSR – are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class II (moderate risk) require special controls (e.g., analytical testing, performance standards, labeling) in addition to general controls, to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class III (high risk) devices are those for which general and special controls are not sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, and for which prior FDA approval of an application for PMA. The PMA approval pathway requires a demonstration, through data from clinical trials and other information about the device (e.g., design history, manufacturing and labeling), that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. FDA will typically inspect the device manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the QSR regulation prior to approval. The PMA approval pathway is costly, lengthy and uncertain.
510(k) Pathway
Devices that are not subject to PMA requirements must, unless exempt, obtain either clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification submission, or approval of a request for “de novo classification”. Most Class II devices must obtain 510(k) clearance, while most Class I devices are 510(k)-exempt. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating to the FDA’s satisfaction that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months. Certain post-market device or labeling modifications require additional FDA review and premarket authorization (510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA approval) before the modified device can be commercially distributed. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to obtain authorization of a modification, the agency may require the manufacturer to cease commercial distribution of the device until the applicable submission type has been submitted to and authorized by the agency.
Low and moderate risk tests that are subject to 510(k) premarket notification but for which no predicate can be identified are automatically classified as Class III. Through the de novo classification pathway, FDA can reclassify such devices as Class I or Class II, either on its own initiative or in response to a request for de novo classification. When granting a de novo classification request for a Class II device, the FDA will establish special controls, which often include labeling restrictions and data requirements. Subsequent applicants can rely upon the de novo product as a predicate for a 510(k) clearance and are subject to the special controls. The de novo route has been used for many in vitro diagnostic products.
Post-market Requirements
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the quality manufacturing requirements set forth in the QSR, registration and listing, the Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulation which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur, and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which includes the requirement that manufacturers report to the FDA corrective actions or product removals initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act that may present a risk to health. Additionally, in order to comply with the FDC Act general prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding, manufacturers must properly label their devices and must not promote them for purposes inconsistent with their labeled intended use.
Applicability of Requirements
Our nCounter FLEX, which is targeted toward clinical laboratories, has been 510(k) cleared by the FDA. The nCounter FLEX was designed and is manufactured under ISO 13485:2016 and the QSR, 21 CFR Part 820, the current quality standards for in vitro diagnostic platforms and medical devices. nCounter FLEX is enabled to run the Prosigna breast cancer assay, as well as other proprietary LDTs that may be developed. In December 2019, we entered into a License and Purchase Agreement, or LAPA, and Service and Supply Agreements, or SSAs, with Veracyte. Pursuant to the LAPA, we completed a license of intellectual property and a sale of certain assets to Veracyte relating to our nCounter FLEX for use in clinical diagnostic applications. Veracyte also acquired certain intellectual property rights and worldwide distribution rights relating to Prosigna and our LymphMark assay, and certain clinical diagnostic assay software modules that operate with the nCounter FLEX. Pursuant to the LAPA, we provided Veracyte a worldwide exclusive license to market and sell clinical diagnostic tests developed for our nCounter FLEX for in vitro diagnostic use and for the development and commercialization of in vitro diagnostic tests, including in vitro diagnostic devices or LDTs, for use on the nCounter FLEX.
Pursuant to the SSAs, we agreed to supply to Veracyte nCounter FLEX, and to manufacture and supply Prosigna kits, LymphMark kits and any additional clinical diagnostic tests that may be developed in the future for nCounter, for a period of at least four years subsequent to the transaction date. While we have retained limited responsibility for regulatory compliance with respect to the current version of nCounter FLEX in certain jurisdictions, under these agreements, Veracyte is responsible for worldwide regulatory compliance for Prosigna, LymphMark, and any additional diagnostic tests that may be developed in the future for the nCounter platform, and has responsibility for worldwide regulatory compliance for all future generations of the nCounter platform for use with clinical diagnostic applications.
The FDA defines a manufacturer broadly to include any person who designs, manufactures, fabricates, assembles, or processes a finished device. More than one entity can be subject to FDA regulation as a manufacturer of a medical device, with each being responsible to comply with the requirements applicable to its activities. For example, a specification developer is an entity that develops the specifications for but does not manufacture a device. Conversely, a contract manufacturer manufactures a device at its facility according to another entity’s specifications. We are the contract manufacturer for the nCounter FLEX while Veracyte is the specification developer for and complaint handling establishment for Prosigna, LymphMark and any other diagnostic tests that may be developed for nCounter FLEX. Both specification developers and contract manufacturers are responsible to ensure that a device complies with applicable requirements. This includes compliance with the provisions of the QSR regulation that pertains to the entity’s activities. To avoid duplication, specification developers and contract manufacturers can assign primary responsibility for an activity to one of the parties (for example, complaint handling). Certain requirements, such as registration and listing, must be done by each party individually.
The FDA enforces its requirements by unannounced inspection, market surveillance, and other means. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an untitled, non-public communication to a public warning letter, to more severe sanctions such as fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and criminal prosecution. For additional information, see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Government Regulation.”
International
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. Our nCounter FLEX has been CE-marked in the EU, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed through the EU and European Economic Area member states. Outside of the EU, regulatory approval needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order to market medical devices. Under the SSAs with Veracyte, Veracyte is responsible for worldwide regulatory compliance for Prosigna, LymphMark, and any additional diagnostic tests that may be developed in the future for the nCounter platform and has responsibility for worldwide regulatory compliance for all future generations of the nCounter platform for use with clinical diagnostic applications.
Environmental Matters
Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subject us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.
