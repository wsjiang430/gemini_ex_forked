Forward-Looking Information
Some of the statements in this document and any documents incorporated by reference, including any statements as to operational and financial projections, constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our businesses’ or our industries’ actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Such statements may address our plans, our strategies, our prospects, changes and trends in our business and the markets in which we operate under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) or in other sections of this document. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. Particular risks facing us include economic, business and other risks stemming from our internal operations, legal and regulatory risks, costs of raw materials, pricing pressures, pension funding requirements, integration of acquisitions and changes in the economy.  These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially because of market conditions in our industries or other factors, and forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. In addition, management’s estimates of future operating results are based on our current complement of businesses, which is subject to change as management selects strategic markets.
All the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risks and uncertainties discussed, including in this filing, under the heading “Risk Factors,” and any subsequent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as well as in any documents incorporated by reference that describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We caution you that these discussion of risks and uncertainties may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment and frequently enter into new businesses and product lines. We cannot predict all potentially relevant risks and uncertainties, and we cannot assess the impact, if any, of these factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We disclaim any responsibility to update or publicly revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this document.
Business
SPX Corporation (“SPX”, “our” or “we”) was founded in Muskegon, Michigan in 1912 as the Piston Ring Company and adopted our current name in 1988. Since 1968, we have been incorporated under the laws of Delaware, and we have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1972.
On September 26, 2015, we completed the spin-off to our stockholders (the “Spin-Off”) of all the outstanding shares of SPX FLOW, Inc. (“SPX FLOW”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SPX prior to the Spin-Off, which at the time of the Spin-Off held the businesses comprising our Flow Technology reportable segment, our Hydraulic Technologies business, and certain of our corporate subsidiaries. Prior to the Spin-Off, our businesses serving the power generation markets had a major impact on the consolidated financial results of SPX. In the recent years leading up to the Spin-Off, these businesses experienced significant declines in revenues and profitability associated with weak demand and increased competition within the global power generation markets. Based on a review of our post-spin portfolio and the belief that a recovery within the power generation markets was unlikely in the foreseeable future, we decided that our strategic focus would be on our (i) scalable growth businesses that serve the heating, ventilation and cooling (“HVAC”) and detection and measurement markets and (ii) power transformer and process cooling systems businesses. As a result, we have significantly reduced our exposure to the power generation markets as indicated by the dispositions of our dry cooling and Balcke Dürr businesses during the first and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively. Additionally, during 2018, we initiated a plan to wind-down the SPX Heat Transfer (“Heat Transfer”) business. See MD&A and Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these actions.
On March 1, 2018 and June 7, 2018, we completed the acquisitions of Schonstedt Instrument Company (“Schonstedt”) and Cues, Inc. (“Cues”), respectively. Schonstedt is a manufacturer and distributor of magnetic locator products used for locating underground utilities and buried objects, while Cues is a manufacturer of pipeline inspection and rehabilitation equipment. The post-acquisition operating results of Schonstedt and Cues are reflected in our Detection and Measurement reportable segment.

On February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Sabik Marine, a manufacturer of obstruction lighting products, from Carmanah Technologies Corporation. The post-acquisition operating results of Sabik Marine will be reflected in our Detection and Measurement reportable segment, beginning in the first quarter of 2019.
Unless otherwise indicated, amounts provided in Part I pertain to continuing operations only (see Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for information on discontinued operations).
We are a diversified, global supplier of infrastructure equipment serving the HVAC, detection and measurement, power transmission and generation, and industrial markets. With operations in approximately 15 countries and over 4,000 employees, we offer a wide array of highly engineered infrastructure products with strong brands.
HVAC solutions offered by our businesses include package cooling towers, residential and commercial boilers, comfort heating, and ventilation products. Our market leading brands, coupled with our commitment to continuous innovation and focus on our customers’ needs, enables our HVAC cooling and heating businesses to serve an expanding number of industrial, commercial and residential customers. Growth for our HVAC businesses will be driven by innovation, increased scalability, and our ability to meet the needs of broader markets.
Our detection and measurement product lines encompass underground pipe and cable locators, inspection and rehabilitation equipment, bus fare collection systems, communication technologies, and specialty lighting. Our detection and measurement solutions enable utilities, telecommunication providers and regulators, and municipalities and transit authorities to build, monitor and maintain vital infrastructure. Our technology and decades of experience have afforded us a strong position in specific detection and measurement markets. We intend to expand our portfolio of specialized products through new, innovative hardware and software solutions in an attempt to (i) further capitalize on the detection and measurement markets we currently serve and (ii) expand the number of markets that we serve.
Within our engineered solutions platform, we are a leading manufacturer of medium and large power transformers, as well as process cooling equipment. These solutions play a critical role in electricity transmission and generation. Specifically, our power transformers play an integral role in the North American power grid, while our process cooling equipment assist our customers in meeting their power generation and industrial needs. The businesses within the platform are committed to driving value through continued focus on operational and engineering efficiencies.
Our remaining businesses (see below for further discussion) engineer, design, manufacture, install and service equipment, including heat exchangers, for the industrial and power generation markets.
Reportable and Other Operating Segments
Prior to the fourth quarter of 2018, we aggregated our operating segments into the following three reportable segments: HVAC, Detection and Measurement, and Engineered Solutions. During the fourth quarter of 2018, due, in part, to certain wind-down activities and the related decline in volumes at our South African subsidiary, DBT Technologies (PTY) LTD (“DBT”), and Heat Transfer business, we concluded that these operating segments are no longer economically similar to the other operating segments within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment. As such, DBT and Heat Transfer are now being reported, for all periods presented, within an “All Other” category outside of our reportable segments. 
The factors considered in determining our aggregated segments are the economic similarity of the businesses, the nature of products sold or services provided, production processes, types of customers, distribution methods, and regulatory environment. In determining our reportable segments, we apply the threshold criteria of the Segment Reporting Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification (“Codification”). Operating income or loss for each of our operating segments is determined before considering impairment and special charges, pension and postretirement expense, long-term incentive compensation, gains (losses) on the sale of our dry cooling business and other indirect corporate expenses. This is consistent with the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates the results of each segment.
HVAC Reportable Segment
Our HVAC reportable segment had revenues of $582.1, $511.0 and $509.5 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and backlog of $46.9 and $41.4 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Approximately 96% of the segment’s backlog as of December 31, 2018 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2019. The segment engineers, designs, manufactures, installs and services cooling products for the HVAC and industrial markets, as well as heating and ventilation products for the residential and commercial markets. The primary distribution channels for the segment’s products are direct to customers, independent manufacturing representatives, third-party distributors, and retailers. The segment serves a customer base in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Core brands for our cooling products include Marley and Recold, with the major competitors to these products being Baltimore Aircoil Company and Evapco. Our heating and ventilation products are sold under the Berko, Qmark, Fahrenheat, and Leading Edge brands, while our Marley-Wylain subsidiary sells Weil-McLain and Williamson-Thermoflo brands.

Approximately 97% of the backlog as of December 31, 2018 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2019. These operating segments engineer, design, manufacture, install and service equipment, including heat exchangers, for the industrial and power generation markets. The primary distribution channels for the group’s products are direct to customers and third-party representatives. These operating segments have a presence in North America and South Africa. 
Acquisitions
We regularly review and negotiate potential acquisitions in the ordinary course of business, some of which are or may be material. 
On March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Schonstedt, a manufacturer and distributor of magnetic locator products used for locating underground utilities and other buried objects, for a purchase price of $16.4, net of cash acquired of $0.3. On June 7, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Cues, a manufacturer of pipeline inspection and rehabilitation equipment, for a purchase price of $164.4, net of cash acquired of $20.6. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in these transactions have been recorded at estimates of fair value as determined by management, based on information available and on assumptions as to future operations, and are subject to change based on the final assessment and valuation of certain income tax amounts.

On February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Sabik Marine, a manufacturer of obstruction lighting products, from Carmanah Technologies Corporation for cash proceeds of $77.0.
We did not acquire any businesses in 2017 or 2016.
Divestitures
We regularly review and negotiate potential divestitures in the ordinary course of business, some of which are or may be material. As a result of this continuous review, we determined that the Balcke Dürr and dry cooling businesses would be better strategic fits with other investors and, thus, we disposed of these businesses in 2016, with Balcke Dürr reflected as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
International Operations
We are a multinational corporation with operations in approximately 15 countries. Sales outside the United States were $221.1, $182.5 and $237.1 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our international operations.
Research and Development
We are actively engaged in research and development programs designed to improve existing products and manufacturing methods and develop new products to better serve our current and future customers. These efforts encompass certain of our products with divisional engineering teams coordinating their resources. We place particular emphasis on the development of new products that are compatible with, and build upon, our manufacturing and marketing capabilities.
Patents/Trademarks
We own approximately 154 domestic and 219 foreign patents (comprising approximately 159 patent “families”), including approximately 40 patents that were issued in 2018, covering a variety of our products and manufacturing methods. We also own a number of registered trademarks. Although in the aggregate our patents and trademarks are of considerable importance in the operation of our business, we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of such importance that its absence would adversely affect our ability to conduct business as presently constituted. We are both a licensor and licensee of patents. For more information, please refer to “Risk Factors.”
Outsourcing and Raw Materials
We manufacture many of the components used in our products; however, our strategy includes outsourcing certain components and sub-assemblies to other companies where strategically and economically beneficial. In instances where we depend on third-party suppliers for outsourced products or components, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products we sell due to supplier failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain the outsourced product and ultimately to our inability to supply products to our customers. We believe that we generally will be able to continue to obtain adequate supplies of key products or appropriate substitutes at reasonable costs.
We are subject to increases in the prices of many of our key raw materials, including petroleum-based products, steel and copper. In recent years, we have generally been able to offset increases in raw material costs. Occasionally, we are subject to long-term supplier contracts, which may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations. We use forward contracts to manage our exposure on forecasted purchases of commodity raw materials (“commodity contracts”). See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on commodity contracts.
Due to our diverse products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the raw materials needed in our operations. We are not significantly dependent on any one or a limited number of suppliers, and we have been able to obtain suitable quantities of raw materials at competitive prices.
Competition
Our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by reportable or operating segment since we and our competitors do not offer all the same product lines or serve all the same markets. In addition, specific reliable comparative figures are not available for many of our competitors. In most product groups, competition comes from numerous concerns, both large and small. The principal methods of competition are service, product performance, technical innovation and price. These methods vary with the type of product sold. We believe we compete effectively on the basis of each of these factors as they apply to the various products and services offered. See “Reportable and Other Operating Segments” above for a discussion of our competitors.

Environmental Matters
See “MD&A — Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates — Contingent Liabilities,” “Risk Factors” and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters.
Employment
At December 31, 2018, we had over 4,000 employees. Six domestic collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 1,000 employees. We also had various collective labor arrangements as of that date covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. While we generally have experienced satisfactory labor relations, we are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes.
Other Matters
No customer or group of customers that, to our knowledge, are under common control accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for any period presented.
Our businesses maintain sufficient levels of working capital to support customer requirements, particularly inventory. We believe our businesses’ sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors.
Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets they serve. In addition, certain businesses have seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.
