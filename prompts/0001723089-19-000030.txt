Key acquisitions that built our artificial lift platform include Harbison-Fischer, Accelerated, Wellmark, PCS Ferguson (f/k/a Production Controls Services, Inc.) and Oil Lift Technology. Our leading polycrystalline diamond cutter business was created through the acquisition of US Synthetic. Through our acquisitions, Apergy has developed experience as an effective operator and successful integrator of businesses.
Separation and Distribution
On April 18, 2018, the Dover Corporation (“Dover”) Board of Directors approved the separation of entities conducting its upstream oil and gas energy business within Dover’s Energy segment (the “Separation”) into an independent, publicly traded company named Apergy Corporation. Apergy Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on October 10, 2017, under the name Wellsite Corporation and was renamed Apergy Corporation on February 2, 2018. Apergy Corporation was formed for the purpose of holding entities, assets and liabilities conducting Dover’s upstream oil and gas business within Dover’s Energy segment. In accordance with the separation and distribution agreement, the two companies were separated by Dover distributing to Dover’s stockholders all 77,339,828 shares of common stock of Apergy on May 9, 2018. Each Dover shareholder received one share of Apergy stock for every two shares of Dover stock held at the close of business on the record date of April 30, 2018. Following the Separation, Dover retained no ownership interest in Apergy, and each company, as of May 9, 2018, has separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. A registration statement on Form 10, as amended, describing the Separation was filed by Apergy with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and was declared effective on April 19, 2018. On May 9, 2018, Apergy common stock began “regular-way” trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the “APY” symbol.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Our business is organized into two reporting segments: Production & Automation Technologies and Drilling Technologies. 
Production & Automation Technologies
Production & Automation Technologies provides products, technologies and services that facilitate the safe, efficient, and cost effective extraction of oil and gas. We design, manufacture, market and service a full range of artificial lift equipment, end-to-end automation and digital solutions, as well as other production equipment. A portion of Production & Automation Technologies revenue is derived from activity-based consumable products, as customers routinely replace items such as sucker rods, plunger lifts and pump parts. We believe that the combination of our artificial lift equipment and our end-to-end proprietary automation solutions helps oil and gas operators lower production costs and optimize well efficiency by enabling oil and gas operators to monitor, predict and optimize performance. Our products are sold under a collection of premier brands, which we believe are recognized by customers as leaders in their market spaces, including Harbison-Fischer, Norris, Alberta Oil Tool, Oil Lift Technology, PCS Ferguson, Pro-Rod, Upco, ESP, Norriseal-Wellmark, Quartzdyne, Spirit, Theta, Timberline and Windrock.
Artificial Lift
Artificial lift equipment is critical to oil and gas operators as a means to increase pressure within the reservoir and improve oil and gas production. Artificial lift is a key technology for increasing oil and gas production throughout the lifecycle of a producing well and is therefore directly linked to operator economics. Production & Automation Technologies offers a full suite of artificial lift solutions to meet the varying needs of operators as oil production volume levels decline over the lifecycle of a producing well, as illustrated in the figure below. Our comprehensive offering provides our customers with cost effective solutions tailored to a well’s specific characteristics and production volumes. We have a strong presence within key U.S. basins where artificial lift technologies are prevalent. We believe our offerings also have significant international potential, as production rates continue to decline in existing wells in regions such as the Middle East, South America and Eastern Europe.
Key artificial lift products include:

• | Electric Submersible Pump (“ESP”)—Our ESPs are fully integrated and customizable systems that are used during the earlier stages of production when barrels per day volume is at its highest level. Our ESP products include centrifugal pumps, gas handling devices, motors, controls and digital solutions to monitor and optimize ESP performance.


• | Gas Lift—Gas lift is a method of artificial lift that involves injecting high pressure gas to lift oil from a well. Gas lift is a preferred artificial lift for deviated wells and wells characterized by large amounts of sand or solid materials. We have been delivering innovative and flexible gas lift solutions to our customers for more than 30 years. Our software takes into account the complexity and production characteristics of the well to deliver the best gas lift solution for each well.

• | Rod Pumping Systems (“Rod Lift”)—As well production extends beyond the initial years, operators typically begin to employ a Rod Lift extraction solution. Our Rod Lift solutions include standard and fit-for-purpose sucker rods and accessories as well as a full range of downhole pumps that address all rod pumping applications. Rod Lift is one of the more prevalent lift solutions employed in wells in the United States and internationally. Our Rod Lift business provides for significant recurring revenue as sucker rods, pumps and accessories are replaced with use.


• | Progessive Cavity Pumps (“PCP”) Plunger, Hydraulic and Jet Lift Systems—We offer a full range of PCP solutions including top drives, high performance pumps, drive rods and controls; a broad range of plunger lift systems including surface, downhole equipment and controllers; and a full range of hydraulic and jet lift systems including jet pumps, hydraulic reciprocating pumps, surface multiplex pumps and automation controllers. These solutions are typically used in wells that have been producing for multiple years and are essential for increasing productivity at lower production volumes.

Digital
Our proprietary digital products are aimed at creating an end-to-end production optimization platform that enables oil and gas operators to monitor, predict and optimize well performance and drive improved return on investment during the production lifecycle. We are a leading provider of productivity tools and performance management software for artificial lift and asset integrity management. Our software has modular architecture that enables specific solutions to be tailored to meet exact customer needs. Real-time data is used by our customers to drive decisions, enhance well servicing and obtain an accurate picture of a well’s functioning over time, resulting in a more connected, digital wellsite that operates more efficiently and safely.
Digital solutions encompass multiple parts of the wellsite and allow an operator centralized monitoring and control capability. Smart instrumentation and hardware at the wellsite have sensing capabilities that allow for the capture of data. Once captured, the data is communicated to a cloud-based Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”) infrastructure platform where it can be analyzed and used to drive value enhancing insights for customers. We believe the combination of our digital products and our strong artificial lift presence enables us to drive continued adoption of digital solutions by our customers. We believe digital adoption is a key secular trend in the oil and gas industry, particularly in a lower oil price environment where operators are focused on lowering the cost per barrel produced over the lifecycle of a well.
Digital solutions bring together multiple layers of equipment, sensors and software. A site may employ a full-scale solution (e.g., a fully connected wellsite using our equipment and software) or a more application specific solution (e.g., a controller used for diagnostics on an ESP lift). Technologies included in our digital products offering include:

• | Controllers and Software Solutions—Controllers and software solutions, including proprietary cloud-based software, to monitor and optimize artificial lift and production. Software is sold on a subscription based model and can be tailored to a breadth of customer requirements, resulting in a fit-for-purpose solution.


• | Downhole Monitoring, Logging and Management—Quartz pressure transducers and smart downhole tools for measuring, monitoring and logging downhole well conditions to improve well productivity.


• | Asset Integrity Management Solutions—End-to-end digital IIoT solutions and portable analyzers to monitor, predict, and optimize health and performance of reciprocating compressors and engines used in wellsites, pipelines, refineries and chemical plants.

Other Production Equipment
We also offer other production equipment including chemical injection systems, flow control valves, oil and water separation, gas conditioning, process heating and pressure vessel products. These products are complementary to our artificial lift and digital technologies offerings.

Drilling Technologies
Drilling Technologies provides highly specialized products used in drilling oil and gas wells. We design, manufacture and market polycrystalline diamond cutters (“PDC”) for use in drill bits under the US Synthetic brand. Our proprietary PDCs are based on years of innovation and intellectual property development in material science applications including the production of highly stable synthetic diamonds, known as “polycrystalline diamonds.” US Synthetic has historically filed new patents at a rate of over 50 patents per year as we continue to advance our diamond science process knowledge and has previously received the prestigious Shingo Prize for operational excellence. We believe our highly engineered PDCs are distinguished by their quality, durability, rate of penetration and longevity. PDCs are a relatively small cost to the oil and gas operator in the context of overall drilling costs, but are critical to successful drilling. As a result, we believe our customers value the quality and performance of US Synthetic PDCs over less expensive and lower capability alternatives because a lower quality PDC can cause unnecessary and expensive drilling delays. Our PDCs are primarily custom designed to meet unique customer requirements and are finished to exact customer specification to ensure optimal performance. PDCs are utilized in both vertical and horizontal drilling and are replaced as they wear during the drilling process.
Key products of our Drilling Technologies segment include:

• | PDC Drill Bit Inserts—Custom designed and manufactured drill bit inserts.


• | Other Drilling Equipment—Includes long-lasting diamond bearings for process-fluid lubricated applications, including underwater applications, downhole drilling tools and industrial pumps, as well as diamond roof bolt mining tools for underground mining.

See Note 13—Revenue to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for revenue by end market for each of our reportable segments.
OTHER BUSINESS INFORMATION

We market and sell our products and technologies through a combination of sales representatives, technical seminars, trade shows and print advertising. We sell directly to customers through our direct sales force and indirectly through independent distributors and sales representatives. Our direct sales force is comprised of highly trained industry experts who can advise our customers on the advantages of our technologies and product offerings. We have developed an extensive network of sales and service locations throughout key regions and basins in North America to better serve our customers. We also host forums and training sessions, such as our Artificial Lift Academy, where our customers can share their experiences, and where we can educate and train our customers in the use of our new technologies. Nearly all of our Drilling Technologies sales, and the majority of our Production & Automation Technologies sales in 2018, were sold directly to the end-use customer.
In addition to our direct sales force, we support a global network of distributors and representatives. We provide our distributors with sales and product literature, advertising and sales promotions, and technical assistance and training with our products. Many of our distributors also stock our products.
Our customer base is diverse. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our 2018 consolidated revenue.
Intellectual Property
We own many patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property, which have been acquired over many years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various times. A large portion of our intellectual property consists of patents, unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate. While our intellectual property is important to our success, the loss or expiration of any of these rights, or any group of related rights, is not likely to materially affect our results of operations on a consolidated basis. We believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements, new product development and improved manufacturing techniques, as well as sales, marketing and service expertise, are significant to our leadership positions in the markets we serve.
Research and Development
We operate in markets that are characterized by changing technology and frequent new product introductions. As a result, our success is dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new technologies and products for our customers. We maintain an active research, development and engineering program with a focus on developing innovative products and solutions, upgrading and improving existing offerings to satisfy the changing needs of our customers, expanding revenue opportunities domestically and internationally, maintaining or extending competitive advantages, improving product reliability and reducing production costs. We believe maintaining a robust innovation and product pipeline will allow us to continue to increase our penetration in key businesses and with key customers.
Raw Materials
We use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished components. We have not historically experienced material impacts to our financial results due to shortages or the loss of any single supplier. Although the required raw materials are generally available, commodity pricing for metals, such as nickel, chrome, molybdenum, vanadium, manganese and steel scrap, fluctuate with market conditions. Recently, tariffs have increased our material input costs, and any further trade restrictions, retaliatory trade measures and additional tariffs implemented could result in higher input costs to our products. Although cost increases in commodities may be recovered through increased prices to customers, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. We attempt to control such costs through short-duration, fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global supply chain initiatives. We source material internationally to achieve the most competitive cost structure. Our global supply chain is intended to provide us with cost-effective solutions for raw materials. Our supply chain could be exposed to logistical disruptions. We maintain domestic suppliers in most cases to provide for contingencies and back-up sources. Despite contingencies and back-up supply optionality, sustained inflation and unpredictable disruptions to supply could have an adverse impact on our business.

Seasonality
Our business is generally not impacted by high levels of seasonality, except for a small portion of our operations in Canada which is impacted by seasonality as the level of drilling activity during the first half of the year is influenced by weather patterns. During the spring months in Canada, wet weather and the spring thaw make the ground unstable and less capable of supporting heavy equipment and machinery. As a result, municipalities and provincial transportation departments enforce road bans that restrict the movement of heavy equipment during the spring months, which reduces our customers’ activity levels. As such, there is greater demand for our products, specifically those provided by our Drilling Technologies business, in the fall and winter seasons when weather conditions allow for increased levels of drilling activities.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 3,300 employees in nine countries. Approximately 100 of our employees in the United States are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Outside the United States, some of our employees are represented by unions or works councils.
Regulation and Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters
Our operations are subject to a variety of international, national, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, worker health and safety, or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial or corrective action requirements, and the imposition of injunctions to prohibit certain activities or force future compliance.
In addition, we depend on the demand for our products and services from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, are affected by changing taxes, price controls, tariffs and trade restrictions and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry in general, including those specifically directed to hydraulic fracturing and onshore products. The adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration, drilling or production in the oil and gas industry, or the imposition of more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products and services or restricting our customers’ operations. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional information related to certain risks regarding regulations and environmental matters.
We utilize behavioral-based safety practices to promote a safe working environment for all of our employees. On a constant basis, safety is prioritized, measured and promoted throughout all levels of our organization. We initiated our “Journey to Zero” program which teaches that all incidents are preventable. The core tenets of our program advocate (i) constant awareness and education of safety principles, (ii) consistent safety behaviors and practices, and (iii) preventing and learning from incidents. Additionally, our operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.
We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Historically, there have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with such laws or regulations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business or operational costs.
