The Industry and Opportunity
 
Data Storage Corporation provides Cloud Managed Services and technologies across multiple platforms. The Company’s technical assets are in geographically diverse, Tier 3 compliant data centers throughout the USA and Canada.
 
Hybrid and Multi-Cloud have become mainstream technological offerings of the Cloud infrastructure managed services industry as companies have moved away from legacy, on-premises technology solutions. This approach has grown more complex, as companies utilize disparate technical environments, including on-premises equipment and software, multi-clouds interfacing with Software as a Service providers, Amazon AWS and others while focusing on the remote employee or a contractor for higher levels of security, driving growth in managed cloud services.


Cloud Managed Service Providers assist businesses in achieving their desired security levels, technical cloud infrastructure and financial objectives while optimizing the value of these technologies and cloud resources through multi-cloud management, ensuring business continuity, governance, and operational efficiencies.
 
One subset of this five hundred-billion-dollar industry and a highly-focused segment of the Company is the IBM Power server; of which AWS, Google and Microsoft are not competitors. It’s estimated that businesses in USA and Canada are operating over one million virtual IBM Power servers, known as LPAR’s. According to the most recent information received from IBM, the typical industries utilizing IBM Power servers are finance, retail, healthcare, government, and distribution organizations.

Corporate History
 
On October 20, 2008, the Company consummated a share exchange transaction with Euro Trend Inc. The Company subsequently changed its name from Euro Trend Inc. to Data Storage Corporation.
 
Data Storage Corporation acquired the assets of SafeData, LLC in June 2010, and the assets of Message Logic LLC, (“Message Logic”) in October 2012.
 
In November 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with an IBM partner, ABC Services, Inc. to provide an IBM Power cloud infrastructure offering, marketed under the name Secure Infrastructure & Services LLC (“SIAS”), a New York limited liability company.
 
In October 2016, the Company purchased the assets of ABC Services, Inc., which included the remaining 50% of the SIAS company.
 
On June 1, 2021, the Company merged its Florida company with Flagship Solutions, LLC. This transaction with an IBM Gold Business Partner was synergetic to the Company’s services and added new solutions.
 
The result of these acquisitions, combined with the Company’s business continuity disaster recovery and IBM Power cloud infrastructure solutions, positions Data Storage Corporation as a leader.
 
Competitive Landscape
 
The markets for the Company’s products and services are competitive. However, competition is limited, in the CloudFirst subsidiary for this $36 billion marketplace, compared to the limitless competitors, competing against Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, and Microsoft today which hold an estimated 51% of the marketplace for X86 cloud infrastructure and X86 disaster recovery platforms. Today, the IBM Power community, based on a recent IBM user survey, only 15% of the IBM Power server community utilizes the cloud. Other Company services and solutions, outside of the IBM Power user community face many competitors for cyber security, however, these solutions and services are typically provided by the Company to their existing clients and distribution companies.


These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances. The Company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features, relative price and performance, product quality and reliability, strong third-party software, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.
 
The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities globally related to disaster recovery and cloud infrastructure, primarily focused on the IBM community. These markets are highly competitive and include several large, well-funded and experienced participants.
 
The Company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on the Company’s ability to continue to provide a high-quality solution as well as increase distribution of the solutions in each of the markets in which it competes.

Government Regulation
 
The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and international laws with respect to its receipt, storage and processing of personal information and other customer data.
 
The Company receives, stores, and processes personal information and other customer data. Personal privacy has become a significant issue in the United States and in many other countries where the Company may provide its offering of solutions. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently complex and evolving, and it is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. There are numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other customer data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among countries or conflict with other rules. The Company generally seeks to comply with industry standards and is subject to the terms of its privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. The Company strives to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations, and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection to the extent possible. Any failure or perceived failure by the Company to comply with its privacy policies, its privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, its privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or public statements against the Company by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause its customers to lose trust in it, which could have an adverse effect on its reputation and business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices regarding the use or disclosure of the Company’s customer’s data, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of customers for the use and disclosure of such data is obtained, could require the Company to modify its solutions and features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit its ability to develop new services and features that make use of the data that its customers voluntarily share with the Company.
 
The Company’s solutions are used by customers in the health care industry, and the Company must comply with numerous federal and state laws related to patient privacy in connection with providing its solutions to these customers. In particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) include privacy standards that protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information and implementing data security standards. Because the Company’s solutions may backup individually identifiable health information for its customers, its customers are mandated by HIPAA to enter into written agreements with the Company known as business associate agreements that require it to safeguard individually identifiable health information. Business associate agreements typically include:
 

● | a description of the Company’s permitted uses of individually identifiable health information; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a covenant not to disclose that information except as permitted under the agreement and to make the Company’s subcontractors, if any, subject to the same restrictions; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | assurances that appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards are in place to prevent misuse of that information; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an obligation to report to the Company’s customers any use or disclosure of that information other than as provided for in the agreement; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a prohibition against the Company’s use or disclosure of that information if a similar use or disclosure by its customers would violate the HIPAA standards; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | the ability of the Company’s customers to terminate their subscription to its solution if the Company breaches a material term of the business associate agreement and are unable to cure the breach; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the requirement to return or destroy all individually identifiable health information at the end of the customer’s subscription; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | access by the Department of Health and Human Services to the Company’s internal practices, books, and records to validate that the Company is safeguarding individually identifiable health information. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human Capital Resources
 
We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. As of March 31, 2023, we employed 45 full-time employees, of which six are executive management, seven are administration and finance, nine are sales staff, several of which are dedicated to support our network of distribution partners, two are marketing staff and twenty-one were part of our technical team. The Company also maintains a group of independent contractors to provide service support and installations on a as needed basis. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and management considers relations with our employees to be in good standing. Although we continually seek to add additional talent to our work force, management believes that it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
 
The Company’s compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of its employees with its performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of the Company’s compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance.
 
The health and safety of the Company’s employees is its highest priority, and this is consistent with its operating philosophy.
