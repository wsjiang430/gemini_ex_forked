ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 References herein to “Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust,” the “Company,” “BREIT,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. 
 General Description of Business and Operations 
 BREIT is a non-exchange traded, perpetual life real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that acquires primarily stabilized income-oriented commercial real estate in the United States and, to a lesser extent, real estate-related securities. Our objective is to bring Blackstone’s leading real estate investment platform with an institutional fee structure and monthly liquidity features to individual investors. We are externally managed by BX REIT Advisors L.L.C. (the “Adviser”), a subsidiary of The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Blackstone”). We are the sole general partner of BREIT Operating Partnership L.P. (“BREIT OP”), a Delaware limited partnership, and we own all or substantially all of our assets through BREIT OP. We currently operate our business in five reportable segments: Multifamily, Industrial, Hotel, and Retail Properties, and real estate-related securities. Multifamily includes various forms of rental housing including apartments, student housing and manufactured housing.
 We qualified as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2017. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.
 We had registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) an offering of up to $5.0 billion in shares of common stock (in any combination of purchases of Class S, Class T, Class D and Class I shares of our common stock), consisting of up to $4.0 billion in shares in our primary offering and up to $1.0 billion in shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (the “Initial Offering”). The Company accepted aggregate gross offering proceeds of $4.9 billion during the period January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2019 and ceased offering shares of common stock under the Initial Offering on January 1, 2019. We have registered with the SEC a follow-on offering of up to $12.0 billion in shares of common stock (in any combination of purchases of Class S, Class T, Class D and Class I shares of our common stock), consisting of up to $10.0 billion in shares in our primary offering and up to $2.0 billion in shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, which we began using to offer shares of our common stock in January 2019 (the “Current Offering” and with the Initial Offering, the “Offering”). 
 As of March 15, 2019, we had received net proceeds of $5.5 billion from selling an aggregate of 517,213,810 shares of our common stock (consisting of 322,215,005 Class S shares, 27,288,937 Class T shares, 38,209,181 Class D shares, and 129,500,687 Class I shares). We have primarily used the net proceeds to make investments in real estate and real estate-related securities.

Our Adviser 
 We are externally managed by our Adviser, and pursuant to the advisory agreement between us and the Adviser (the “Advisory Agreement”), we have delegated to the Adviser the authority to source, evaluate and monitor our investment opportunities and to make decisions related to the acquisition, management, financing and disposition of our assets, in accordance with our investment objectives, guidelines, policies and limitations, as well as provide us with our executive management team. Our board of directors will at all times have oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. 
 Our Adviser is a part of Blackstone, an alternative asset management business that includes the management of investment vehicles focused on private equity, real estate, public debt and equity, non-investment grade credit, real assets, and secondary funds, all on a global basis. Through its different businesses, Blackstone had total assets under management of $472.2 billion as of December 31, 2018.
 In connection with the performance of its duties, our Adviser benefits from the resources, relationships, and expertise of the 545 professionals in Blackstone’s global real estate group, which is one of the largest real estate investment managers in the world with $136.2 billion of investor capital under management as of December 31, 2018. Blackstone's real estate group ("Blackstone Real Estate") has one centralized investment committee (the "Investment Committee") that meets weekly to review large new investments around the world.  The Investment Committee includes all Senior Managing Directors in Blackstone Real Estate, as well as select senior executives of Blackstone.
 Our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and other executive officers are senior Blackstone real estate professionals. Our Adviser, our executive officers, and other personnel supplied to us by our Adviser are each not obligated to dedicate any specific amount of time to our business. Our Adviser is subject to the supervision and oversight of our board of directors and has only such functions and authority as our board of directors delegates to it. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, our Adviser is entitled to receive a base management fee, and expense reimbursements. In addition, BREIT Special Limited Partner L.L.C. (the “Special Limited Partner”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blackstone, is entitled to receive a performance participation allocation. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and Item 13 “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detail on the terms of the Advisory Agreement.
 Investment Objectives 
 Our investment objectives are to invest in assets that will enable us to: 
  
• | provide current income in the form of regular, stable cash distributions to achieve an attractive distribution yield;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preserve and protect invested capital;
--+---------------------------------------


• | realize appreciation in net asset value (“NAV”) from proactive investment management and asset management; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide an investment alternative for stockholders seeking to allocate a portion of their long-term investment portfolios to commercial real estate with lower volatility than listed public real estate companies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investment Strategy
 Our investment strategy is to acquire primarily stabilized income-oriented commercial real estate in the United States. To a lesser extent, we also invest in real estate-related securities to provide current income and, together with our lines of credit, a source of liquidity for our share repurchase plan, cash management and other purposes. 
 Our investment strategy capitalizes on Blackstone’s scale and the real-time information provided by its real estate holdings to identify and acquire our target investments at attractive pricing. We also benefit from Blackstone’s reputation and ability to transact in scale with speed and certainty, and its long-standing and extensive relationships in the real estate industry. After acquisition, we leverage Blackstone Real Estate’s established asset management team, which focuses on value creation through the oversight and improvement of the operating performance of Blackstone Real Estate’s portfolio holdings. 
 Our investments in primarily stabilized income-oriented commercial real estate in the United States focus on a range of asset types. These may include multifamily, industrial, hotel, retail, and office assets, as well as others, including, without limitation, healthcare, student housing, senior living, data centers, manufactured housing and storage properties. For a breakdown of our portfolio by asset type see the “Investments in Properties” section below.

Our real estate-related securities strategy is designed to generate current income and an attractive investment return. We also believe that our real estate-related securities will, in conjunction with our lines of credit, help maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy monthly repurchase requests under our share repurchase plan and manage cash before investing subscription proceeds into properties. We utilize the Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies (“BREDS”) team to assist with this portion of the portfolio. The BREDS team leverages the competitive advantages of the broader Blackstone Real Estate platform and its own proprietary investment models to seek attractive real estate-related securities investment opportunities throughout the capital structure. 
 We believe that our structure as a perpetual-life REIT will allow us to acquire and manage our investment portfolio in a more active and flexible manner. We do not have a pre-determined operational period or the need to provide a “liquidity” event at the end of that period. 
 Investments in Properties 
 We invest primarily in stabilized income-oriented commercial real estate in the United States. We may invest to a limited extent in Canadian cities and potentially elsewhere, including as part of portfolio acquisitions where certain properties are located outside the United States. As of December 31, 2018, our entire portfolio is located in the United States. We may also acquire assets that require some amount of capital investment in order to be renovated or repositioned or unstabilized assets that require lease up. We generally will limit investment in new developments on a standalone basis, but may consider development that is ancillary to an overall investment. 
 We do not designate specific geography or sector allocations for the portfolio; rather we invest in regions or asset classes where we see the best opportunities that support our investment objectives. 
 The following charts describe our portfolio composition in real properties based on fair value as of December 31, 2018:

Investments in Real Estate-Related Securities 
 Our Real Estate-Related Securities investments focus on public and private real estate debt, including, but not limited to, commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”), mortgages, loans, mezzanine and other forms of debt, and may also include preferred equity. Additionally, while we do not intend to make open market purchases of common stock in public equity REITs or other companies focused on owning real property, we may make such investments in companies with mortgages as one of their core businesses. Our investments in real estate-related securities will be focused in the United States, but may also include securities issued or backed by real estate in Europe and certain other countries.
 Borrowing Policies 
 We use financial leverage to provide additional funds to support our investment activities. This allows us to make more investments than would otherwise be possible, resulting in a broader portfolio. Subject to the limitation on indebtedness for money borrowed in our charter described below, our target leverage ratio is in the range of 60% of our gross real estate assets (measured using the greater of fair market value and the cost of gross real estate assets, including equity in our securities portfolio), inclusive of property-level and entity-level debt net of cash, but excluding debt on our securities portfolio. Our real estate-related securities portfolio may have embedded leverage, including through the use of reverse repurchase agreements and derivatives, including, but not limited to, total return swaps, securities lending arrangements and credit default swaps. During times of increased investment and capital market activity, but subject to the limitation on indebtedness for money borrowed in our charter described below, we may employ greater leverage in order to build a broader portfolio of assets. We may leverage our portfolio by assuming or incurring secured or unsecured property-level or entity-level debt. 
 Under our charter, we have a limitation that precludes us from borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets, which approximates borrowing 75% of the cost of our investments (unless a majority of our independent directors approves any borrowing in excess of the limit and we disclose the justification for doing so to our stockholders), but such restriction does not restrict the amount of indebtedness we may incur with respect to any single investment.

For an overview of our borrowings, see Item 7 — “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 
 Taxation of the Company
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT, under the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017, the year in which the proceeds from the Initial Offering were released from escrow. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable net income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for U.S. federal income tax not to apply to our earnings that we distribute. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. 
 Our qualification as a REIT also depends on our ability to meet various other requirements imposed by the Code, which relate to organizational structure, diversity of stock ownership, and certain restrictions with regard to the nature of our assets and the sources of our income. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal income and excise taxes and state and local taxes on our income and assets. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT for any taxable year, we may be subject to material penalties as well as federal, state, and local income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and we would not be able to qualify as a REIT for the subsequent four full taxable years.
 Furthermore, we have one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) which pay federal, state, and local income tax on their net taxable income. See Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items” for additional tax status information. 
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
 Enactment of the Tax Act
 On December 22, 2017, the federal tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), was signed into law. Since enactment, the IRS has issued several proposed regulations (the “Proposed Regs”), which interpret and clarify many salient changes contained in the Tax Act. The Tax Act and Proposed Regs have made fundamental changes to the taxation of REITs and their security holders. The most significant of these provisions are described below. The individual and collective impact of these changes on REITs such as the Company and their security holders is uncertain, and may not become evident for some period. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the Tax Act on the Company and their investment.
Pass-Through Business Income Tax Rate Lowered through Deduction
 Under the Tax Act, United States holders that are individuals, trusts or estates generally may deduct 20% of “qualified REIT dividends” (i.e., REIT dividends other than capital gain dividends and portions of REIT dividends designated as qualified dividend income eligible for capital gain tax rates). The overall deduction is limited to 20% of the sum of the taxpayer’s taxable income (less net capital gain) and certain cooperative dividends, subject to further limitations based on taxable income. The deduction, if allowed in full, equates to a reduction in the maximum effective United States federal income tax rate on ordinary REIT dividends from 37.0% to 29.6%. As with the other individual income tax changes, the deduction provisions are effective beginning in 2018. Without further legislation, the deduction will sunset and no longer apply after 2025.
Maximum Corporate Tax Rate Lowered to 21%; Elimination of Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax
 The Tax Act reduces the 35% maximum federal corporate income tax rate to a maximum 21% corporate rate. The Tax Act also permanently eliminates the corporate alternative minimum tax. These provisions are effective beginning in 2018. As disclosed above, we have one or more TRSs which would be subject to a maximum tax rate of 21% under the Tax Act, before giving effect to any applicable state and local taxes.Net Operating Loss Modifications
 Net operating loss (“NOL”) provisions are modified by the Tax Act. The Tax Act limits the NOL deduction to 80% of taxable income (before the deduction). It also generally eliminates NOL carrybacks for individuals and non-REIT corporations (NOL carrybacks did not apply to REITs under prior law), but allows indefinite NOL carryforwards. The new NOL rules apply to losses arising in taxable years beginning in 2018. As disclosed above, we have one or more TRSs which would be subject to the NOL provisions under the Tax Act.

Environmental Matters 
 As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws has not had a material, adverse effect on our business, assets, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions, and we do not believe that our existing portfolio will require us to incur material expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. 
Competition 
 We face competition from various entities for investment opportunities in properties, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. In addition to third-party competitors, other programs sponsored by the Adviser and its affiliates, particularly those with investment strategies that overlap with ours, will seek investment opportunities under Blackstone’s prevailing policies and procedures. Many of these entities may have greater access to capital to make investments than we have. 
 In the face of this competition, we have access to our Adviser’s and Blackstone’s professionals and their industry expertise and relationships, which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage and help us source, evaluate and compete for potential investments. We believe these relationships will enable us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face. For additional information concerning these competitive risks, see Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investment Activities.”
 Employees 
 We have no employees. Our operations are conducted by the Adviser.
 Conflicts of Interest 
 We are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with Blackstone, including the Adviser and its affiliates. See Item 1A — “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest.”
