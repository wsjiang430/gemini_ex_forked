Our Company
Vista Outdoor is a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of consumer products in the outdoor sports and recreation markets. Vista Outdoor conducts operations through two operating segments, Outdoor Products and Shooting Sports. Vista Outdoor is headquartered in Anoka, Minnesota and has 18 manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico along with international customer service, sales and sourcing operations in Asia, Canada, and Europe. Vista Outdoor was incorporated in Delaware in 2014. 
We serve the outdoor sports and recreation markets through a diverse portfolio of over 40 well-recognized brands that provide consumers with a wide range of performance-driven, high-quality and innovative products, including sporting ammunition and firearms, golf rangefinders, hydration products, outdoor accessories, outdoor cooking solutions, and protection for certain action sports. We serve a broad range of end consumers, including outdoor enthusiasts, hunters and recreational shooters, athletes, as well as law enforcement and military professionals. Our products are sold through a wide variety of mass, specialty and independent retailers and distributors, such as Academy, Amazon, Bass Pro Shops/Cabela's, Big Rock Sports, Sports South, Sportsman's Warehouse, Target, and Walmart. We also sell certain of our products directly to consumers through the relevant brand's website. We have a scalable, integrated portfolio of brands that allows us to leverage our deep customer knowledge, product development and innovation, supply chain and distribution, and sales and marketing functions across product categories to better serve our retail partners and end consumer. 
Many of our brands have a rich, long-standing heritage, such as Federal Premium, founded in 1922, and Bushnell, founded in 1948. We believe this brand heritage supports our leading market share positions in multiple categories. For example, we believe we hold the No.1 sales position in the U.S. markets for ammunition, game calls, golf rangefinders, and trap throwing devices. To maintain the strength of our brands and drive revenue growth, we invest in product innovation to continuously improve the performance, quality, and affordability of our products while providing world-class customer support to our retail partners and end consumer. We have received numerous awards for product innovation by respected industry publications and for customer service from our retail customers. Additionally, high-profile professional sportsmen and athletes use and endorse our products, which influences the purchasing behavior of recreational consumers.

Market Opportunity 
We participate in the global market for consumer goods geared toward outdoor recreation and shooting sports. Spending on outdoor recreation products in the U.S., including the purchase of gear for bicycling, camping, fishing, hunting, motorcycling, off-roading, snow sports, trail sports, and wildlife viewing, totaled $93 billion in 2016, according to the 2017 
2

Outdoor Recreation Economy National Report issued by the Outdoor Industry Association, which publishes data every five years.
Outdoor Recreation Industry 
The outdoor recreation and accessories industry represents a large focus area of our business. Examples of the sports and activities we target include archery, camping, cycling, golf, hiking, hunting, snow skiing, target shooting, and wildlife watching. Our consumers often participate in more than one of these activities.
Shooting Sports Industry 
Shooting sports products currently represent slightly over half of our sales. Examples of the shooting sports activities we target include target shooting, hunting, as well as ammunition for local law enforcement, the U.S. government and international markets. The shooting sports industry historically has been a cyclical business and can be impacted by the current political climate, the timing of national elections, and other market factors.
Competitive Strengths 
Portfolio of Leading Brands Focused on Outdoor Recreation and Shooting Sports
We have a diverse portfolio of outdoor recreation and shooting sports brands, many with long-standing, market-leading positions. We seek to maintain our brand strength by developing performance-enhancing innovations, introducing new products, engaging in product and brand marketing campaigns, providing marketing support to our strategic channel partners, and establishing a strong e-commerce presence to capitalize on the ongoing shift by consumers to online shopping. We target selling prices that balance our premium positioning with our focus on affordability to capture a large consumer base. Our brand strength and product innovations allow us to drive sales growth and deliver robust profit margins. 
We employ a segmented brand strategy that leverages over 40 brands that are leaders in niche categories. This approach provides us with competitive advantages, including the following: 

• | Strong brand recognition, with the ability to command a leading market share position across several categories. For example, our Federal ammunition brand has the number one market share in ammunition; Savage Arms is a nationally recognized long gun brand among hunters and recreational shooters who desire quality at an affordable price; Bushnell Golf maintains a leading market share position in laser rangefinders; CamelBak is a leading provider of hydration system solutions for individuals in the hiking, cycling, and winter sports markets; Bell is a leading provider of helmets for individuals in the cycling market, and has a number one market share in motocross helmets; Giro is a leading provider of helmets, footwear, and apparel for individuals in the cycling markets and helmets and goggles for the winter sports markets; Primos is the number one market share leader in game calls; and Hoppe's brand has a number one market share in gun cleaning solutions and accessories.


• | Better insight into consumer preferences and market dynamics through information sharing across our portfolio. Our strategic relationships with key accounts combined with our world-class customer service model deliver consumer insights into our aligned product development organization and process. This information helps us develop and maintain a robust new product pipeline.

Leading Innovation and Product Development Competencies 
We believe our product development capabilities and intellectual property portfolio provide us with a strong competitive advantage. By applying our engineering and manufacturing expertise, we have been able to bring to market new and innovative products that maintain product differentiation while targeting affordability for our end consumers. 
We have continuously invested in research and development ("R&D") and made disciplined investments in new technology to deliver sustainable growth and satisfy the evolving needs of our customers. We have leveraged our resources to help our brands develop a sophisticated R&D business process that we believe is difficult to replicate. Our current intellectual property portfolio includes approximately 800 patents, providing us with valuable proprietary trade secrets and technological know-how that we share across our platform. We employ approximately 115 dedicated design and product development professionals across the organization. Recent examples of our innovative, market-leading products include:

• | For the bird hunters, Federal launched Black Cloud TSS for waterfowl hunters and Heavyweight TSS blended loads for turkey hunters. Small Tungsten Super Shot is in high demand with turkey and now waterfowl enthusiasts alike. Ultra-dense TSS pellets fly farther, penetrate deeper and stay on target longer.


• | Federal Syntech changes the landscape of target ammunition for personal defense and the recreational or competition shooter. Syntech Pistol Caliber Carbine (PCC) is built to meet the exhaustive demands of fast-pace PCC competitions, with flawless function in carbine platforms. Syntech Training Match, loads that offer the same velocity, trajectory and point of impact as equivalent Federal Premium Personal Defense HST and Tactical HST duty ammunition. 


• | For the competition shooter and big-game hunter, Federal has introduced several centerfire rifle rounds loaded with bullets from Barnes TSX in 17 loads, Berger Hybrid Hunter in 10 cartridges, Berger Hybrid OTM in three options and expanded Sierra MatchKing to include 6mm Creedmoor.


• | For cyclists, Giro’s newest high-end road helmet, the Aether MIPS spherical, is the most technically advanced helmet ever constructed. This product is the first in-molded, lightweight, road helmet to integrate the exclusive MIPS spherical technology.

This feature-packed product adds temperature and barometric pressure to Bushnell’s patented Slope technology to give golfer's what we believe is the most precise compensated distances ever. 


• | For hunters and shooters, Bushnell introduced its Prime, Nitro, and Forge optics lines to address unmet and common needs by delivering superior light transmission in low light situations and clarity in any condition. We believe this newly introduced line of optics delivers superior performance.


• | For the outdoor cooking enthusiast, Camp Chef introduced the Sidekick, a pellet grill accessory that moves the possibilities of outdoor cooking to almost limitless options and the Pursuit pellet grill, which includes key features like slide and grill, ash clean out and added shelving in a portable configuration.

Proven Manufacturing, Global Sourcing, and Distribution Platform 
We believe that our state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise, sourcing and distribution capabilities, and high-quality retail, wholesale and distributor networks allow us to produce, deliver and replenish products in a more efficient and faster manner than our competitors. We believe this speed allows us to better serve the needs of our customers and end consumers and capture market share. We also believe the scale and scope of our manufacturing and distribution operations also allows us to be one of the lowest-cost producers in many of our product categories. 
Integrated supply chain management is core to our company. We procure large quantities of raw materials for our manufacturing operations and we leverage negotiating disciplines and production methods, with the objective of obtaining the best price and delivery available as well as low-cost conversion of raw materials into finished product. We also source finished product both domestically and internationally for global distribution. We continuously seek to improve our vendor base as well as our in-country support and oversight, and, through our integrated supply chain management process, we seek to provide year-over-year reductions in product costs. We believe the scope and scale of our sourcing network is not easily replicated. 
We maintain positive relationships with our retail partners based on trust and professionalism. Our long-standing commitment to our customers, diverse product offering and focus on profitability for both our company and our retail partners have enabled us to gain shelf space and secure premium placement of our products at many major retailers. Our top retail and distributor partners include Academy, Amazon, Bass Pro Shops/Cabela's, Big Rock Sports, Sports South, Sportsman's Warehouse, Target, and Walmart. Our management team interfaces directly with the executives of many of our top retail partners to ensure we are delivering the products our retailers need to meet the demands of the end consumer in the most efficient and profitable manner possible. Furthermore, we believe our scale is a unique competitive advantage that allows us to leverage our platform to efficiently and profitably service our largest retail customers. For example, we work with our key retail customers to develop marketing and advertising campaigns, provide inventory replenishment support, and organize product category merchandising plans. These capabilities give us an advantage as we believe few competitors offer this level of retail support or a more comprehensive product portfolio.
Our Strategy
Our current strategic business plan is designed to allow us to focus our resources on pursuing growth in our market-leading brands by serving our target consumer with new and innovative products; leveraging our channel relationships and the 
4

reputation of our brands with our end consumers; expanding our e-commerce capabilities; and continuously improving operations.
Customers and Marketing 
Our primary customers are retailers and distributors who serve outdoor enthusiasts, hunters, recreational shooters and athletes, as well as law enforcement and military professionals. Sales to our top ten retailer and distributor customers accounted for approximately 40% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, U.S. customers represented approximately 69% of our sales, while international customers represented approximately 21%, and law enforcement and military professionals represented approximately 10%. See Note 19, Operating Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our customers and geographic information regarding our sales. We believe the outdoor recreation and shooting sports industries are led by enthusiasts with a passion for reliable, high-performance products, who rely on a wide variety of media for opinions and recommendations about available products. We utilize paid, earned, shared, and owned media to enhance the perception of our brands and products and to reinforce our leadership positions in the market. We supplement this exposure with data-driven print and digital advertising that is designed to maximize reach and return on investment. We have an industry-leading digital media presence that includes YouTube influencers and Range365, a Vista Outdoor branded content site. Our goal is to strengthen our existing consumers' brand loyalty while at the same time reaching new users of our products. 
Quality Assurance 
We maintain a disciplined quality assurance process. We set stringent metrics to drive year-over-year quality improvements. We also have a customer call center, which allows us to collect important customer data and feedback on our customer service to ensure that our customers and end consumers are satisfied with our products and customer service. 
Employees 
We employ approximately 5,200 people. We operate 18 manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada. We have union-represented employees at our Westfield, Massachusetts and Tijuana, Mexico locations, comprising approximately 6% of our total workforce. We have had no strikes or work stoppages during the last five years. We believe that our employee relations generally are good. 
Manufacturing and Supply
We operate 18 manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Canada. 
We source finished product both domestically and internationally for global distribution. Our supply chain and logistics infrastructure gives us the ability to serve a broad array of wholesale and retail customers, many of whom rely on us for services such as category management, marketing campaigns, merchandising and inventory replenishment. Our strong wholesale and retail relationships and diverse product offering provide a unique competitive advantage.
Competition 
Competition in the markets in which we operate is based on a number of factors, including price, quality, product innovation, performance, reliability, styling, product features, and warranties, as well as sales and marketing programs. Given the diversity of our product portfolio, we have various significant competitors in each of our markets, including: Clarus, Shimano, Callaway, and Johnson Outdoors in the outdoor sporting market; Nikon and Vortex in the optics market; Hydro Flask, Contigo, Yeti, and Nalgene in the hydration systems market; Remington Arms, Winchester Ammunition of Olin Corporation, and various smaller manufacturers and importers, including Black Hills Ammunition, CBC Group, Fiocchi Ammunition, Hornady, PMC, Rio Ammunition, and Wolf in the ammunition market; and Marlin, Mossberg, Remington Arms, Ruger, Smith and Wesson of American Outdoor Brands, and Winchester in the firearms market.
Seasonality 
Our business experiences a certain level of seasonality. Sales of our spring products and summer products, such as golf accessories, can be adversely impacted by unseasonably cold or wet weather in those periods. Sales of our premium hunting accessories are generally highest during the months of August through December due to shipments around the fall hunting season and holidays. Sales of sporting ammunition historically have been lower in our first fiscal quarter. Our winter sport accessories sales can be negatively impacted by unseasonably warm or dry weather.

Intellectual Property 
In the highly competitive business in which we operate, our tradenames, service marks, and trademarks are important to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. We rely upon trade secrets, continuing technological innovations, and licensing arrangements to maintain and improve our competitive position. We also have a portfolio of approximately 800 U.S. and foreign patents, and we believe these patents, as well as unpatented research, development, and engineering skills, make important contributions to our business. We are not aware of any facts which would negatively impact our continuing use of any of our tradenames, service marks, trademarks, or patents. 
Regulatory Matters 
Like many other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, we are required to comply with numerous laws, rules, and regulations, including those surrounding labor and employment law, environmental law, consumer product safety, data privacy and security, workplace safety, and the export and import of our products. These laws, rules and regulations currently impose significant compliance requirements on our business, and more restrictive laws, rules, and regulations may be adopted in the future. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable domestic and international laws and regulations. 
Our operations are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing the discharge, treatment, storage, transportation, remediation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and restoration of damages to the environment, as well as health and safety matters. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and that forward-looking, proper and cost-effective management of air, land, and water resources is vital to the long-term success of our business. Our environmental policy identifies key objectives for implementing this commitment throughout our operations. We incur operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental requirements, and could incur significant additional costs as a result of more stringent requirements that may be promulgated in the future. 
Some environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal Superfund law and similar state laws, can impose liability, without regard to fault, for the entire cost of the cleanup of contaminated sites on current or former site owners and operators or parties who sent wastes to such sites. We are conducting investigation and/or remediation activities at certain of our current or former sites where impacts from our historical operations have been identified. We have also been identified as a PRP, along with other parties, in regulatory agency actions associated with hazardous waste disposal sites. While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities at these sites, based on currently available information, we do not currently expect these matters, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. We could, however, incur substantial additional costs as a result of any additional obligations imposed or conditions identified at these or other sites in the future. 
As a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products, we are subject to various domestic and international consumer product safety laws, such as the Consumer Products Safety Act, which empowers the Consumer Products Safety Commission to investigate and deem certain of our products as unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the Consumer Products Safety Commission or similar international agencies could ask a court to require us to repurchase or recall one or more of our products. In addition, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some cities and states, as well as in other countries in which we sell our products. 
We are also subject to the rules and regulations of the ATF and various state and international agencies that control the manufacture, export, import, distribution, and sale of firearms, explosives, and ammunition. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, these agencies may limit our growth or business activities, or, in extreme cases, revoke our licenses to do business. Our business, as well as the business of all producers and marketers of ammunition and firearms, is also subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations and protocols. Applicable laws:
• require the licensing of all persons manufacturing, exporting, importing, or selling firearms and ammunition as a business; 
• require serialization of new firearms, labeling and tracking the acquisition and disposition of firearms, certain types of ammunition, and certain related products; 

• | require background checks for purchasers of firearms;

6

• impose waiting periods between the purchase of a firearm and the delivery of a firearm; 
• prohibit the sale of firearms to certain persons, such as those below a certain age and persons with criminal records; 
• regulate the use and storage of gun powder or other energetic materials; 
• regulate the interstate sale of certain firearms and ammunition; 
• prohibit the interstate mail-order sale of firearms and ammunition; 
• regulate our employment of personnel with certain criminal convictions; and 
• restrict access to firearm or ammunition manufacturing facilities for certain individuals from other countries or with criminal convictions. 
In some cases, the handling of our technical data and the international sale of our products is also regulated by the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. These agencies oversee the export of certain of our products including firearms, shotguns, ammunition, and night vision devices and related technical data, amongst other products. In many instances, we must obtain export authorizations for international shipments. In addition, the ITAR requires congressional approval for any firearms export application with a total value of $1 million or higher. To date, most of our requests for export licenses have been approved. These agencies can impose civil and criminal penalties, including denying us from exporting our products, for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
We are also regulated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which handles the out-bound and in-bound movement of certain of our products, as well as components, parts, and materials used in our manufacturing processes. The agency can detain and seize shipments, as well as penalize us for failure to comply with applicable regulations. The agency also works closely with the Department of State and the Department of Commerce to ensure compliance in protection of national security.
