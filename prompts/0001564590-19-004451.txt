Item 1. Business 
Overview
 We are one of the world’s leading clinical contract research organizations, or CROs, by revenue, solely focused on providing scientifically-driven outsourced clinical development services to the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Our mission is to accelerate the global development of safe and effective medical therapeutics. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by our disciplined operating model centered on providing full-service Phase I-IV clinical development services and our therapeutic expertise. We believe this combination results in timely and cost-effective delivery of clinical development services for our customers. We believe that we are a partner of choice for small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies based on our ability to consistently utilize our full-service, disciplined operating model to deliver timely and high-quality results for our customers. Accordingly, we believe we are well positioned to continue to expand our market share in the growing Phase I-IV CRO market.
 We were founded in 1992 by Dr. August J. Troendle, an industry pioneer, as a Phase II-IV focused CRO with a strong, scientifically-driven and disciplined operating model. Throughout our 26-year history, we have grown almost exclusively organically, with our core founding members having been integrally involved in developing and instilling our differentiated culture and operating philosophy across our company. We are led by a dedicated and experienced senior management team with significant industry experience and knowledge focused on clinical development. Our senior management team has an average tenure with Medpace of 13 years, including four senior managers with over 20 years with us, and brings a healthy balance of significant experience with Medpace, regulators and other companies in the industry. 
 We focus on conducting clinical trials across all major therapeutic areas, with particular strength in Cardiology, Metabolic Disease, Oncology, Endocrinology, Central Nervous System, or CNS, and Antiviral and Anti-infective or AVAI, as well as therapeutic expertise in Medical Devices. 
 Our Market
 Clinical Development Process
 Before a new drug can be commercialized, it often must undergo extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing and regulatory review to verify safety and efficacy. CROs provide a comprehensive range of product development services for Phase I-IV clinical trials. These clinical trials are separated into distinct phases in order to thoroughly evaluate the product. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, 2018 Biopharmaceutical Research Industry Profile, a trade group publication, indicates that from drug discovery through approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, developing a new medicine takes approximately 10 to 15 years and costs approximately $2.6 billion.

The following graphic, based on data presented in the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, 2013 Biopharmaceutical Research Industry Profile and 2018 Biopharmaceutical Research Industry Profile, industry trade group publications, illustrates the various stages and typical timeline of the clinical development process:
 Stages of Clinical Development
 

Our Services
 We provide a full suite of services supporting the entire clinical development process from Phase I to Phase IV. We offer these services across a wide range of therapeutic areas.
 Our comprehensive suite of clinical development services includes, but is not limited to, the following:
 Medical Department
 The medical department consists of therapeutic leads who provide strategic direction for study design and planning, train operational staff, work with primary investigators, provide medical monitoring and meet with regulatory agencies. Our customers rely on our expertise throughout the entire clinical trial process with therapeutically-focused physicians fully engaged throughout the study. We believe this depth of therapeutic leadership and engagement on each project results in a close working relationship with customers built on a level of trust that results in us being granted greater control over the clinical trial process.
Clinical Trial Management
 Our team of clinical trial managers are responsible for leading all aspects of study execution. The clinical trial manager, or CTM, drives accountability across the functional team members and is responsible for successful operational execution. The CTM serves as the primary contact for the customer. Experience and therapeutic expertise are main factors when assigning CTMs to projects.
 ClinTrak is integrated with our standard operating procedures (“SOPs”), allowing the CTMs to access real-time study metrics. ClinTrak is constantly evaluated and enhanced with our processes.

Data-Driven Feasibility
 We have a dedicated feasibility team consisting of clinical experts who are an integrated part of the project team. Our feasibility team is able to analyze a specific protocol, using many data sources to determine countries and sites that are most appropriate for the study.
 Study Start-Up
 Our global Study Start-Up staff is well-versed in all aspects of clinical trial start up activities, including study documentation submission processes to independent Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, ethics committees and to ex-US competent authorities. Our study start-up team includes fully dedicated budget and legal associates to ensure focused negotiations and execution of site contracts.
 Patient Recruitment and Retention
 We navigate the complex world of patient recruitment and retention by providing strategic solutions that address clinical program needs. Our dedicated internal patient recruitment and retention department supports the study team in providing an overall strategy that identifies patient motivators and any potential barriers to join the clinical research study, and includes recommended strategies to effectively engage and recruit patients, as well as how to retain the patients once they enroll. 
Clinical Monitoring
 Our clinical monitoring group consists of highly experienced clinical research associates, or CRAs. With their experience and training, our CRAs are able to provide unparalleled site management services that includes both in-house and onsite monitoring. Their knowledge of local regulations and laws, in addition to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, guidelines ensure compliance and data quality. Our CRAs report into a global matrix structure to ensure consistent training, oversight and management. Each CRA receives comprehensive, hands-on training in an individualized curriculum consisting of in-house and field-based training, supplemented with clinical research department core rotations and ongoing study-specific training.
 Risk-Based Monitoring
 We support a comprehensive approach to monitoring to ensure adequate protection of the rights, welfare, and safety of human subjects and the quality and integrity of the study. This approach focuses on prevention and mitigation of important and likely risks to the study, and is part of the overarching surveillance that Medpace utilizes to manage studies. Medpace utilizes this approach for all studies, regardless of whether a centralized monitoring approach is employed.
 Regulatory Affairs
 Our Regulatory Affairs department has a strong track record of providing expert strategic, operational, and tactical regulatory guidance, as well as creating thorough, scientifically-grounded regulatory compliant documentation to regulatory agencies around the globe. Members of this team bring a long tenure of regulatory experience and scientific knowledge to each project. The group, led by former government officials and experienced drug development subject matter experts, provides comprehensive international support at each stage of the drug and biologics development processes. They have particular expertise within the areas of advanced therapeutics, accelerated development pathways, pediatrics, and rare diseases. The group also has a dedicated publishing function that has full electronic and paper publishing capabilities to support all types of international regulatory submissions.

Net New Business Awards and Backlog
 New business awards represent the value of anticipated future net revenue that has been recognized in backlog during the period. This value is recognized upon the signing of a contract or receipt of a written pre-contract confirmation from a customer that confirms an agreement in principle on budget and scope. New business awards also include contract amendments, or changes in scope, where the customer has provided written authorization for changes in budget and scope or has approved us to perform additional work as of the measurement date. Awards may not be recognized as backlog after consideration of a number of factors, including whether (i) the relevant net revenue is expected only after a pending regulatory hurdle, which might result in cancellation of the study, (ii) the customer funding needed for commencement of the study is not believed to have been secured or (iii) study timelines are uncertain or not well defined timeline. In addition, study amounts that extend beyond a three-year timeline are not included in backlog. The number and amount of new business awards can vary significantly from period to period, and an award’s contractual duration can range from several months to several years based on customer and project specifications.
 Cancellations arise in the normal course of business and are reflected when we receive written confirmation from the customer to cease work on a contractual agreement. The majority of our customers can terminate our contracts without cause upon 30 days’ notice. Similar to new business awards, the number and amount of cancellations can vary significantly period over period due to timing of customer correspondence and study-specific circumstances. 
 Net new business awards represent gross new business awards received in a period offset by total cancellations in that period. On an Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) basis, net new business awards were $899.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. On an Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (“ASC 605”) basis, net new business awards were $581.0 million, $426.1 million and $427.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 Backlog represents anticipated future net revenue from net new business awards that have commenced, but have not been completed. Reported backlog will fluctuate based on new business awards, changes in scope to existing contracts, cancellations, net revenue recognition on existing contracts and foreign exchange adjustments from non-U.S. dollar denominated backlog. On an ASC 606 basis, as of December 31, 2018, our backlog was $1,057.9 million. On an ASC 605 basis, as of December 31, 2018, our backlog increased by $101.7 million, or 19.4%, to $626.1 million compared to $524.4 million as of December 31, 2017. Our backlog as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $483.9 million. Included within backlog on an ASC 606 basis as of December 31, 2018 is approximately $580 million to $600 million that we expect to convert to net revenue in 2019, with the remainder expected to convert to net revenue in years after 2019. Backlog and net new business award metrics may not be reliable indicators of our future period net revenue as they are subject to a variety of factors that may cause material fluctuations from period to period. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the scope of projects, cancellations and duration and timing of services provided. No assurance can be given that we will be able to realize the net revenue that is included in backlog. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Our backlog may not convert to net revenue at our historical conversion rates,” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—New Business Awards, Cancellations and Backlog” of Parts I and II, respectively, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
 Sales and Marketing
 We employ an integrated sales and marketing team to sell our services to biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device companies.
 We have an experienced and highly trained global team of professional business development representatives and business development support staff focused on securing business from both new and existing customers, through a consultative and strategic sales approach. We embed our medical and scientific experts from the beginning of the sales process when we first engage potential customers, and they remain embedded across the lifecycle of the sale and throughout the life of the project, program or partnership.
 As part of its sales strategy, our business development team focuses on a customer segmentation model. Our team targets and engages customers in our addressable market, matches customer characteristics with therapeutic fit and 
 - 11 -

maintains a mindset of full-service outsourcing. Our structured and disciplined approach facilitates strong account evaluation, which results in increased focus by the sales team, the development of effective and productive territories, the management of sales force effectiveness and the creation of a process whereby both marketing and sales operate under the same guiding principles.
 We are able to consult collaboratively with our customers and help optimize timely completion of their clinical trials and programs, in part, because we engage our therapeutic experts from the beginning of the sales process and involve our regulatory affairs experts and highly trained operations team throughout the clinical trial process. Our sales team is then able to take the study design, regulatory plan and execution plan discussed up front and carry that through to the proposal and provide a final concept during one-on-one customer discussions and final CRO evaluations.
 Our marketing team supports the business development function in three key areas, generating brand awareness through customized campaigns and web-site development, conference planning and lead generation through market research and business intelligence analysis. The marketing team is set up in two mirrored teams, one team to address our therapeutic strategy and tactics, and the second team to monitor and address market environment across our lines of business. All of our sales and marketing data are housed within a third party customer relationship management tool that provides us the analytics we need to make sales planning and sales management decisions.
 Competition
 We compete primarily against other full-service CROs as well as services provided by in-house research and development, or R&D, departments of biopharmaceutical companies. Our major CRO competitors include Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, ICON plc, Syneos Health, Inc., PAREXEL International Corporation, Pharmaceutical Product Development, LLC, PRA Health Sciences, Inc., IQVIA Holdings Inc. and numerous specialty and regional CROs.
 We generally compete on the basis of a number of factors, including experience within specific therapeutic areas, quality of staff and services, reliability, range of provided services, ability to recruit principal investigators and patients into studies expeditiously, ability to organize and manage large-scale, global clinical trials, global presence with strategically located facilities, speed to completion, price and overall value. We believe we compete effectively with our competitors across these factors, particularly due to our full-service operating model, our deep therapeutic expertise in areas that are among the largest, most complex and fastest growing in pharmaceutical development, our global platform and our experienced and committed management team. However, some of our competitors have greater financial resources and a wider range of service offerings over a greater geographic area than we do, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to these competitors.
 The CRO industry remains fragmented, with several hundred smaller, narrowly focused service providers and a small number of full-service companies with global capabilities. We believe there are significant barriers to others becoming a global provider offering a broad range of services and products including the cost and experience necessary to develop strong therapeutic areas, expertise to manage complex clinical programs, infrastructure to support large global programs, ability to deliver high-quality services and expertise required to prepare regulatory submissions in numerous jurisdictions.
 Government Regulation
 Development of Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices
 The development of drugs, biologics and medical devices is highly regulated in the United States and other countries. Our services are subject to varying regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the pre-clinical and clinical trial process. In the United States, the FDA has primary authority to regulate these activities, in addition to the approval process, and the subsequent manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing for these products, which are the responsibility of our customers. Before a marketing application for a drug is ready for submission to regulatory authorities, the candidate drug must often undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials. In the United States, these trials must be conducted in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, its implementing regulations, and other federal and state requirements that require 
 - 12 -

the drug to be tested and studied in certain ways prior to approval. The FDA has similar authority and requirements with respect to the clinical testing of biological products and medical devices. Before a human clinical trial may begin in the United States, the manufacturer or sponsor of the clinical product candidate must file an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, with the FDA, which contains, among things, the results of pre-clinical tests, manufacturer information and other analytical data. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial must be conducted pursuant to, and in accordance with, an effective IND. Each human clinical trial we conduct is subject to the oversight of an IRB, which is an independent committee that has the regulatory authority to review, approve and monitor a clinical trial for which the IRB has responsibility. The FDA and IRB receive reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing and may require the modification, suspension, or termination of clinical trials if, among other things, an unreasonable risk is presented to patients or if the design of the trial is insufficient to meet its stated objective. In addition, information about certain clinical trials must be made publicly available on the federal government website, www.clinicaltrials.gov.
 In the United States, GCP regulations govern the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. In order to comply with GCP and other requirements, we must, among other things:
  
☐ | comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified principal investigators and clinical research sites;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | obtain specific written commitments from principal investigators;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | obtain IRB review and approval and supervision of the clinical trials by an independent review board or ethics committee;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | obtain a favorable opinion from regulatory agencies to commence a clinical trial;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | verify that appropriate patient informed consents are obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | ensure that adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | monitor the validity and accuracy of data;
--+-------------------------------------------


☐ | monitor drug or biologic accountability at clinical research sites; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | verify that principal investigators and clinical trial staff maintain records and reports and permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Clinical trials conducted outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations may or may not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protection of patient safety and privacy and the control of clinical trial pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other clinical trial materials. Within the EU, these requirements are enforced by the EMA and requirements may vary slightly from one member state to another. In Canada, clinical trials are regulated by the Health Products and Food Branch of Health Canada as well as provincial regulations. Similar requirements also apply in other jurisdictions, including countries outside the EU and countries in Asia and Latin America where we operate or where our customers may intend to apply for marketing authorization. Clinical trials conducted outside the United States also may be subject to FDA regulation if the clinical trials are conducted pursuant to an IND or an Investigational Device Exemption for a product candidate that will seek FDA approval or clearance. In addition, clinical trial sponsors follow ICH E6 guidelines as a principle for GCP.
 - 13 -

The clinical trial customer and the parties conducting the clinical trials share in responsibilities to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled. Many of the functions we regularly perform in the conduct of clinical trials subject us directly to regulations (e.g., compliance with GCP), and in some circumstances, we will take on legal and regulatory responsibility either through a transfer of obligations to us from our clinical trial customers or our acting as local legal representative for certain of our clinical trial customers. We may be subject to regulatory action if we fail to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with certain regulations may also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials. For example, violations of GCP could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter, suspension or termination of a clinical trial, refusal of the FDA to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—If we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, government regulations and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be adversely affected” of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 We monitor our clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have adopted SOPs that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. In the United States, our procedures were developed to ensure compliance with GCP and associated requirements.
 Health Information Privacy
 The confidentiality of personal health information, including patient-specific information collected during clinical trials, is heavily regulated in the United States and other countries. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has promulgated rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and their implementing regulations, including the Privacy and Security Rules, or collectively, HIPAA, that govern the use, handling and disclosure of personally identifiable medical information. These regulations also establish procedures for the exercise of an individual’s rights and the methods permissible for de-identification of health information. HIPAA applies to “covered entities,” which include certain types of healthcare providers, as well as service providers to covered entities which access protected health information, known as “business associates.” Two of our subsidiaries, Medpace Clinical Pharmacology, LLC and C-MARC, LLC, are covered entities under HIPAA. Further, many investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are also directly subject to HIPAA as covered entities. There are instances where we may be considered a business associate of a covered entity investigator, and we have signed business associate agreements with some investigators. If we are determined to be a business associate, we would be directly liable for any breaches of protected health information and other HIPAA violations. We are also liable contractually under any business associate agreements we have signed with covered entities. In addition, we are also subject to privacy legislation in Canada under the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector and the Personal Health Information Protection Act and privacy legislation in the EU under the 95/46/EC Privacy Directive on the protection and free movement of personal data, as replaced by the General Data Protection Regulation from early 2018 onwards. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry—Current and proposed laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our service offerings” of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Health Industry Arrangements
 The conduct of pre-clinical and clinical trials may be subject to laws and regulations that are intended to prevent the misuse of government healthcare program funding. In the United States, these laws include, among others, the False Claims Act, which prohibits submitting or causing the submission of false statements or improper claims for government healthcare program payments; and the Anti-Kickback statute, which prohibits paying, offering to pay or receiving payment with the intent to induce the referral of services or items that are covered under a federal healthcare program. Violations of these laws and regulations may incur administrative, civil, and criminal penalties.

Employee Safety and Workplace Conditions
 Most of our employees are office based and subject to health and safety regulations covering offices, with which we comply. In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers might be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus, which apply to our clinic and laboratories. Furthermore, certain employees might have to receive initial and periodic training to ensure compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines. We are subject to similar regulations with respect to our laboratories in Belgium, Singapore and China.
Environmental Regulation and Liability
 We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety in the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. Our operations include the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials and medical wastes. We may, in the future, incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations for contamination of sites we own or operate (including contamination caused by prior owners or operators of such sites), the off-site disposal of hazardous substances and for personal injuries or property damage arising from exposure to hazardous materials from our operations. We believe that we have been and are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that we currently have no liabilities under such environmental requirements that could reasonably be expected to materially harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Intellectual Property
 We develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets, and copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We have obtained or applied for trademarks and copyright protection in the United States and in a number of foreign countries. Our material trademarks include Medpace and ClinTrak. Although the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country, trademarks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. Although we believe the ownership of trademarks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our employees. We do not have any material licenses, franchises or concessions.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018 we had approximately 2,900 employees worldwide. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement specific to our company. We believe our overall relations with our employees are good. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately 2,500 employees.
 The success of our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific and technical staff. The level of competition among employers in the United States and overseas for skilled personnel, particularly for those with Ph.D., M.D. or equivalent degrees or training, is high. We believe that our brand recognition and our multinational presence are advantages in attracting qualified candidates. We also believe that the wide range of clinical trials in which we participate allows us to offer broad experience to clinical researchers. In addition, our disciplined and centralized approach to hiring and training has fostered, and we believe will continue to foster, strong employee loyalty and a low turnover rate.
 - 15 -

Liability and Insurance
 We may be liable to our customers for any failure to conduct their clinical trials properly according to the agreed-upon protocol and contract. If we fail to conduct a clinical trial properly in accordance with the agreed-upon procedures, we may have to repeat a clinical trial or a particular portion of the services at our expense, reimburse the customer for the cost of the services and/or pay additional damages.
 At our Phase I clinic, we study the effects of drugs on healthy volunteers. In addition, in our clinical business we, on behalf of our customers, contract with physicians who render professional services, including the administration of the substance being tested to participants in clinical trials, many of whom are seriously ill and are at great risk of further illness or death as a result of factors other than their participation in a trial. As a result, we could be held liable for bodily injury, death, pain and suffering, loss of consortium or other personal injury claims and medical expenses arising from a clinical trial. In addition, we sometimes engage the services of vendors necessary for the conduct of a clinical trial, such as laboratories or medical diagnostic specialists. Because these vendors are engaged as subcontractors, we are responsible for their performance and may be held liable for damages if the subcontractors fail to perform in the manner specified in their contract.
 To reduce our potential liability, and as a requirement of the GCP regulations, informed consent is required from each volunteer and patient. In addition, our customers provide us with contractual indemnification for all of our service related contracts. These indemnities generally do not, however, protect us against certain of our own actions such as those involving negligence or misconduct. Our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed if we were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim that is not indemnified, that is outside the scope of an indemnity or where the indemnity, although applicable, is not honored in accordance with its terms.
 We maintain professional liability insurance in amounts we believe to be appropriate. This insurance provides coverage for vicarious liability due to negligence of the investigators who contract with us, as well as claims by our customers that a clinical trial was compromised due to an error or omission by us. If our insurance coverage is not adequate, or if insurance coverage does not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed.
