Our Company 
Business Overview 
We are a performance materials company and one of the largest domestic producers of commercial silica, a specialized mineral that is a critical input into a variety of end markets. Through our acquisition of EP Minerals, LLC and its affiliated companies ("EPM"), we are an industry leader in the production of industrial minerals, including diatomaceous earth, clay (calcium bentonite and calcium montmorillonite) and perlite used as filter aids, absorbents and functional additives for a variety of industries. 
During our 119-year history, we have developed core competencies in mining, processing, logistics and materials science that enable us to produce and cost-effectively deliver over 400 diversified product types to customers across our end markets. As of December 31, 2018, we operate 27 production facilities across the United States. We control 627 million tons of reserves of commercial silica, which can be processed to make 297 million tons of finished products that meet American Petroleum Institute ("API") frac sand specifications, and 56 million tons of reserves of diatomaceous earth, perlite, and clays.
Our operations are organized into two reportable segments based on end markets served and the manner in which we analyze our operating and financial performance: (1) Oil & Gas Proppants and (2) Industrial & Specialty Products. We believe our segments are complementary because our ability to sell to a wide range of customers across end markets in these segments allows us to maximize recovery rates in our mining operations, optimize our asset utilization and reduce the cyclicality of our earnings.
Acquisitions
On May 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of EP Acquisition Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“EPAP”), and the ultimate parent of EPM. Contemporaneous with the merger, EPAP was renamed EP Minerals Holdings, Inc. ("EPMH"). The consideration paid consisted of $743.2 million of cash, net of cash acquired of $19.1 million, including $0.5 million of post-closing adjustments. EPM's industrial minerals are used as filter aids, functional additives, catalysts, adsorbents and absorbents for a variety of industries including food and beverage, biofuels, automotive retail, recreational water, oil refining, edible oil, farm and home, landscape, paint and coatings, agriculture, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and insecticides. The acquisition of EPM increased our industrial materials product offering in our Industrial & Specialty Products segment. 
On August 16, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Mississippi Sand, LLC ("MS Sand"). MS Sand is a frac sand mining and logistics company based in St. Louis, Missouri. 
On April 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of White Armor, a product line of cool roof granules used in industrial roofing applications. 
On August 22, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Sandbox Enterprises, LLC ("Sandbox") as a “last mile” logistics solution for frac sand in the oil and gas industry. 
On August 16, 2016, we completed the acquisition of New Birmingham, Inc. (“NBI”), the ultimate parent company of NBR Sand, LLC (“NBR”), a regional sand producer located near Tyler, Texas. The acquisition of NBI increased our regional frac sand product offering in our Oil & Gas Proppants segment. 
 See Note E - Business Combinations to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 
Corporate History 
U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 14, 2008. U.S. Silica Company, which has been a domestic producer of commercial silica for 119 years, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on November 25, 2008. On January 31, 2012, we completed our initial public offering of our common stock. 
Our Strengths 
We attribute our success to the following strengths: 

• | Large-scale producer with a diverse and high-quality reserve base. Our 27 geographically dispersed operating production facilities control an estimated 627 million tons of reserves, including API size frac sand and large quantities of silica with distinct characteristics, and an estimated 56 million tons of reserves of diatomaceous earth, perlite, and clays. These reserves give us the ability to sell over 400 product types to customers in both our Oil & Gas Proppants segment and Industrial & Specialty Products segment. We believe our large-scale production, logistics capabilities and long reserve life make us a preferred supplier to our customers. Our consistent, reliable supply of reserves gives our customers the security to customize their production processes around our products.

4

Furthermore, our relatively large scale and wide product portfolio provide us earnings diversification and the ability to reach broader market segments. 

• | Geographically advantaged footprint with intrinsic transportation advantages. We believe the strategic location of our facilities and our logistics capabilities, including those obtained through strategic acquisitions discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contribute to our customer retention rates and our ability to reach broader market segments. In our Oil & Gas Proppants segment, our network of frac sand production facilities with access to Class I rail either onsite or by truck, combined with the strategic locations of our transloads, enable us to serve every major U.S. shale basin. Additionally, our acquisition of SandBox extends our delivery capability directly to our customers' wellhead locations. We believe we are one of the few frac sand producers capable of cost-effectively delivering API grade frac sand to most of the major U.S. shale basins by on-site rail. 

Additionally, due to the high weight-to-value ratio of many silica products in our Industrial & Specialty Products segment, the proximity of our facilities to our customers’ facilities often results in us being their sole supplier. This advantage has enabled us to enjoy strong customer retention in this segment, with our top five Industrial & Specialty Products segment customers purchasing from us for an average of over 50 years.
Diatomaceous earth, clay, and perlite facilities are located near major highways and export corridors to optimize the cost of operations and shipment. Products can be shipped via bulk truck, rail or packaged. We utilize experienced in-house international logistics operations using a broad base of steamship partners to enable efficient and cost-effective exports to approximately 100 countries.

• | Low-cost operating structure. We focus on building and operating facilities with low delivered cost to enable us to better manage through market downturns. We believe the combination of the following factors contributes to our goal of having a low-cost structure and high margins:


• | our ownership of the vast majority of our reserves, resulting in mineral royalty expense that was less than 0.1% of our sales in 2018;


• | the optimal positioning of our mines and their respective processing plants, enabling cost-efficient and highly automated production processes;


• | our processing expertise, which enables us to create over 400 product types with unique characteristics while minimizing waste;


• | our integrated logistics management expertise and geographically advantaged facility network, which enables us to reliably ship products by the most cost-effective method available, whether by truck, rail or barge, to meet the needs of our customers, whether at in-basin transload locations or directly at wellhead locations via our Sandbox operations, whether domestic or overseas;


• | our large customer base across numerous end markets, which allows us to maximize our mining recovery rate and asset utilization; and


• | our large overall and plant-level operating scale.


• | Strong reputation with our customers and the communities in which we operate. We believe we have built a strong reputation during our 119-year operating history. We have a long track record of timely delivery of our products according to customer specifications, which we believe contributes to a reputation for dependability and high-quality, innovative products. We also have an extensive network of technical resources, including materials science and petroleum engineering expertise, which enables us to collaborate with our customers to develop new products and improve the performance of their existing applications. We also believe we are known in the communities in which we operate as a preferred employer and a responsible corporate citizen, which generally serves us well in hiring new employees and securing difficult to obtain permits for expansions and new facilities.


• | Commitment to innovation. Our team is dedicated to continuing to develop patentable products through research and development. The acquisition of EPM has accelerated our team’s research and development efforts by providing additional expertise and testing equipment, such as experience with filtration and with high temperature manufacturing processes.


• | Experienced management team. The members of our senior management team bring significant experience to the dynamic environment in which we operate. Their expertise covers a range of disciplines, including industry-specific operating and technical knowledge as well as experience managing high-growth businesses. We believe we have assembled a flexible, creative and responsive team that can quickly adapt to the rapidly evolving unconventional oil and natural gas landscape.

Our Business Strategy 
The key drivers of our growth strategy include: 

• | Increase our presence and product offering in specialty products end markets. Our research and business development teams work to enhance our existing products, develop new products and pursue opportunities to acquire new product offerings through business acquisitions, which we expect will increase our presence and market share in certain specialty products end markets and allow us to enter new markets. We manage a robust pipeline of new products in various stages of development. On May 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of EPM, a global producer of industrial minerals, including diatomaceous earth, clay and perlite, which increased our industrial materials product offerings. 


• | Optimize product mix and further develop value-added capabilities to maximize margins. We continue to actively manage our product mix at each of our plants as we seek to maximize our profit margins. This requires us to use our proprietary expertise in balancing key variables, such as mine geology, processing capacities, transportation availability, customer requirements and pricing. We expect to continue investing in ways to increase the value we provide to our customers by expanding our product offerings, improving our supply chain management, upgrading our information technology, and enhancing our customer service model.


• | Effectively position our Oil & Gas Proppants facilities to optimally serve our customers. We continuously execute initiatives to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our frac sand production facilities. Our mix of Northern White, regional, and local in-basin mines are positioned to provide a full range of frac sand products to our customers. We are also constantly undergoing continuous improvement efforts to reduce production costs at our facilities. 


• | Optimize our supply chain network and leverage our logistics capabilities to meet our customers’ needs. We continue to strategically position our supply chain in order to deliver sand according to our customers’ needs, whether at a plant, a transload or the wellhead. We believe that our supply chain network and logistics capabilities are a competitive advantage that enables us to provide superior service for our customers.


◦ | Our acquisition of Sandbox extends our delivery capability directly to our customers' wellhead locations, which increases efficiency and provides a lower cost logistics solution for our customers. Sandbox has operations in the major United States oil and gas producing regions, including Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, the Rocky Mountains and the Northeast, where their largest customers are located.


◦ | We manage our transload network through partnerships rather than owned transloads because we believe this approach enables us to receive high quality service from our specialized transloading partners without the significant capital investment related to owning the assets. As of December 31, 2018, we have storage capacity at 51 transloads located near all of the major shale basins in the United States.


• | Evaluate both Greenfield and Brownfield expansion opportunities and other acquisitions. We expect to continue leveraging our reputation, processing capabilities and infrastructure to increase production, as well as explore other opportunities to expand our reserve base and sell new products.


◦ | We have completed several Greenfield projects that became operational in 2018. In May 2017, we purchased a Greenfield site in Crane County, Texas, which became operational during the first quarter of 2018 and which we expect will eventually produce approximately 4 million tons of annual frac sand capacity. Additionally, in July 2017, we purchased a Greenfield site near Lamesa, Texas, which became operational during the third quarter of 2018 and which we expect will eventually produce approximately 6 million tons of annual frac sand capacity.


◦ | We are continuing to actively pursue acquisitions to grow. Our primary objective is to acquire value adding products in our Industrial & Specialty Products segment, and assets that are complementary to our current offering for our Oil & Gas Proppants segment. We prioritize acquisitions that provide opportunities to realize synergies, including entering new geographic markets, acquiring attractive customer contracts and improving operations. For example, on December 31, 2018, we completed our acquisition of a manufacturing facility located in Millen, Georgia. This facility has a kiln, which will allow for the production of specialty industrial products that require high temperature heat treatments. See the descriptions of other recent and notable acquisitions under “Business Overview-Acquisitions” above. See the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks related to our acquisition activities.

• | Maintain financial strength and flexibility. We intend to maintain financial strength and flexibility to enable us to better manage through industry downturns and pursue acquisitions and new growth opportunities as they arise. In connection with the EPM acquisition, on May 1, 2018, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with BNP Paribas, as administrative agent, and the lenders named therein. The Credit Agreement increased our then existing senior debt by establishing a new $1.380 billion senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $1.280 billion term loan (the “Term Loan”) and a $100 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) (collectively the "Credit Facility) that may also be used for swingline loans or letters of credit, and we may elect to increase the term loan in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. For more information on the Credit Agreement see Note K - Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2018, we had $202.5 million of cash on hand and $95.2 million of availability under the Revolver. 

Our Products and Services
In order to serve a broad range of end markets, we produce and sell a variety of commercial silica, diatomaceous earth, clay and perlite products. We also offer services including transportation, equipment rental and contract labor.
Whole Grain Silica Products—We sell whole grain commercial silica products in a range of shapes, sizes and purity levels. We sell whole grain silica that has a round shape and high crush strength to be used as frac sand in connection with oil and natural gas recovery. We also sell whole grain silica products in a range of size distributions, grain shapes and chemical purity levels to our customers involved in the manufacturing of glass products, including a low-iron whole grain product sold to manufacturers of architectural and solar glass applications. In addition, we sell several grades of whole grain round silica to the foundry industry and provide whole grain commercial silica to the building products industry. Sales of whole grain commercial silica products accounted for approximately 64%, 72%, and 81% of our total sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
Ground Silica Products—Our ground commercial silica products are inherently inert, white and bright, with high purity. We market our ground silica in sizes ranging from 40 to 250 microns for use in plastics, rubber, polishes, cleansers, paints, glazes, textile fiberglass and precision castings. We also produce and market fine ground silica in sizes ranging from 5 to 40 microns for use in premium paints, specialty coatings, sealants, silicone rubber and epoxies. Our milling technology allows us to offer some of the smallest particle size ground silica products in the United States. Sales of ground silica products accounted for approximately 6%, 6%, and 12% of our total sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
Performance Material Products—We sell engineered performance materials made from diatomaceous earth (DE), clay and perlite. DE is used in filtration for foods and beverages, pharmaceuticals and swimming pools. DE is also used as a functional additive for paint and coatings, plastics and rubber, and agriculture. Perlite (hydrated volcanic glass) is used mainly for filtration. Calcium bentonite clay from Mississippi is used for bleaching, catalysis and adsorption in edible oil processing, aromatics purification, and industrial and chemical applications. Sales of our performance material products accounted for approximately 8% of our total sales for 2018. We had no sales of performance material products in 2017 and 2016.
Industrial Mineral Products—We also produce and sell certain other industrial mineral products, such as aplite, magnesium silicate and aggregates made with DE and clay. Aplite is a mineral used to produce container glass and insulation fiberglass and is a source of alumina that has a low melting point and a low tendency to form defects in glass. Magnesium silicate is a highly selective adsorbent made from a mixture of silica and magnesium, used extensively in preparative and analytical chromatography. DE and clay aggregates are mainly used as an absorbent for automotive, industrial and sports turf applications. Sales of our other industrial mineral products accounted for approximately 3%, 3%, and 1% of our total sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
Services—We offer services through the provision of transportation, equipment rental and contract labor services, primarily through SandBox, to companies in the oil and gas industry. Sales of our Services accounted for approximately19%, 19%, and 6% of our total sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
Our Industry
The commercial silica industry consists of businesses that are involved in the mining, processing and distribution of commercial silica. Commercial silica, also referred to as “silica,” “industrial sand and gravel,” “sand,” “silica sand” and “quartz sand,” is a term applied to sands and gravels containing a high percentage of silica (silicon dioxide, SiO2) in the form of quartz. Commercial silica deposits occur throughout the United States, but mines and processing facilities are typically located near end markets and in areas with access to transportation infrastructure. Other factors affecting the feasibility of commercial silica production include deposit composition, product quality specifications, land-use and environmental regulation, including permitting requirements, access to electricity, natural gas and water and a producer’s expertise and know-how. New entrants face hurdles to establish their operations, including the capital investment required to develop a mine and build a plant, a lack 
7

of industry-specific mining knowledge and experience, the difficulty of obtaining operating permits, and the difficulty of assembling a diverse portfolio of customers to optimize operations.
EPM's diatomaceous earth, perlite, montmorillonite clay and bentonite clay products are sold globally, where they are used in hundreds of applications for filtration, functional additives, absorbents and adsorbents. The largest industries for these products include food and beverage, wine, beer, paint and coatings, biofuel, pharmaceuticals, chemical, oil and gas, plastics and rubber, automotive and agriculture. 
Extraction Processes 
Commercial silica deposits are formed from a variety of sedimentary processes and have distinct characteristics that range from hard sandstone rock to loose, unconsolidated dune sands. While the specific extraction method utilized depends primarily on the deposit composition, most silica is mined using conventional open-pit bench extraction methods and begins after clearing the deposit of any overlaying soil and organic matter. The silica deposit composition and chemical purity also dictate the processing methods and equipment utilized. For example, broken rock from a sandstone deposit may require one, two or three stages of crushing to liberate the silica grains required for most markets. Unconsolidated deposits may require little or no crushing, as silica grains are not tightly cemented together. 
We conduct only surface mining operations and do not operate any underground mines, although we do lease underground reserves at our Festus, Missouri, operation, which are being mined underground by a contractor. Mining methods at our facilities include conventional hard rock mining, hydraulic mining, surface or open-pit mining of loosely consolidated silica deposits and dredge mining. Hard rock mining involves drilling and blasting in order to break up sandstone into sizes suitable for transport to the processing facility by truck, slurry or conveyor. Hydraulic mining involves spraying high-pressure water to break up loosely consolidated sandstone at the mine face. Surface or open-pit mining involves using earthmoving equipment, such as bucket loaders, to gather silica deposits for processing. Lastly, dredging involves gathering silica deposits from mining ponds and transporting them by slurry pipelines for processing. We may also use slurry pipelines in our hydraulic and open-pit mining efforts to expedite processing. Silica mining and processing typically has less of an environmental impact than the mining and processing of other minerals, in part because it uses fewer chemicals. Our processing plants are equipped to receive the mined sand, wash away impurities, eliminate oversized or undersized particles and remove moisture through a multi-stage drying process. Our 27 production facilities are located primarily in the eastern half of the United States, with operations in Alabama, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Our acquired subsidiary, EPM, operates plants and/or mines in Nevada, Oregon, Nebraska, Tennessee, Mississippi and Arizona. Each of our facilities operates year-round, typically in shift schedules designed to optimize facility utilization in accordance with market demand. Our facilities receive regular preventative maintenance, and we make additional capital investments in our facilities as required to support customer volumes and internal performance goals. For more information related to our production facilities, see Item 2. Properties. 
Freshwater diatomaceous earth (DE) deposits were formed from the compression of diatoms (single-celled algae skeletons) that are a unique species with superior characteristics for filtration and for use as functional additives.  The DE is usually layered with volcanic ash and tephra and overlaid with basalt.  We use conventional open-pit bench extraction methods that begin after clearing the overlaying soil and organic matter.  DE may require a crushing stage before processing to remove moisture through a multi-stage drying process.
Clay deposits may contain volcanic ash, calcareous concretions, sand, or silt that are removed during mining and processing. We use conventional open-pit bench extraction methods that begin after clearing the overlaying soil and organic matter.
We believe we have broad and high-quality mineral reserves due to our strategically located mines and facilities. At December 31, 2018, we estimate that we had approximately 683 million tons of proven and probable mineral reserves. The quantity and nature of the mineral reserves at each of our properties are estimated by our mining engineers. Our mining engineers update our reserve estimates annually, making necessary adjustments for reserve usage at each location during the year and additions or reductions due to property acquisitions and dispositions, quality adjustments and mine plan updates. Before acquiring new reserves, we perform surveying, drill core analysis and other tests to confirm the quantity and quality of the to-be acquired reserves. In some instances, we acquire the mineral rights to reserves without actually taking ownership of the properties. 
Production Processes 
After extracting silica ore, the silica is washed with water to remove fine impurities such as clay and organic particles. In some deposits, these fine contaminants or impurities are tightly bonded to the surface of the silica grain and require attrition scrubbing to be removed. Other deposits require the use of flotation to collect and separate contaminants from the silica. When 
8

these contaminants are weakly magnetic, special high intensity magnets may be utilized in the process to improve the purity of the final commercial silica product. After the silica has been washed, most output is dried prior to sale. 
The next step in the production process involves the classification of commercial silica products according to their chemical purity, particle shape and particle size distribution. Generally, commercial silica is produced and sold in either whole grain form or ground form. Whole grain silica generally ranges from 12 to 140 mesh. Mesh refers to the number of openings per linear inch on a sizing screen. Whole grain silica products are sold in a range of shapes, sizes and purity levels to be used in a variety of industrial applications, such as oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing proppants, glass, foundry, building products, filtration and recreation. Some whole grain silica is further processed to ground silica of much smaller particle sizes, ranging from 5 to 250 microns. A micron is one-millionth of a meter.
After extracting diatomaceous earth (DE) ore, the DE is crushed and fed into a continuous production process consisting of wet end drying and classification, calcination through a rotary kiln, and finished end sizing. Clay undergoes a multi-step process that could include crushing, calcining, drying, screening/sizing, acid activation, flash drying, classification, milling, and roller/compaction. 
Quality Control 
We maintain quality standards in all of our mining and processing facilities, some of which include International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") 9001-registered quality systems. We use automated process control systems that efficiently manage the majority of the mining and processing functions, and we monitor the quality and consistency of our products by conducting hourly tests throughout the production process to detect variances. All of our major facilities operate a testing laboratory to evaluate and ensure the quality of our products and services. We also provide customers with documentation verifying that all products shipped meet customer specifications. These quality assurance functions are designed to ensure that we deliver quality products to our customers and maintain customer trust and loyalty. 
In addition, we have certain company-wide quality control mechanisms. We maintain a company-wide quality assurance database that facilitates easy access and analysis of product and process data from all plants. We also have fully staffed and equipped corporate laboratories that provide critical technical expertise, analytical testing resources and application development to promote product value and cost savings. The labs consist of different departments: a foundry lab, a paint and coatings lab, an analytical lab, a minerals-processing lab and an oil and gas lab. The foundry lab is fully equipped for analyzing foundry silica based on grain size distribution, acidity, acid demand value and turbidity, which is a measure of silica cleanliness. The paint and coatings lab provides formulation, application, and testing of paints, coatings and grouts for end use in fillers and extenders as well as building products. The analytical lab performs various analyses on products for quality control assessment. The minerals processing lab models plant production processes to test variations in deposits and improve our ability to meet customer requirements. The oil and gas lab performs testing and provides in-depth analysis of all types of hydraulic fracturing proppants to verify products meet specifications, such as API size and crush strength specifications. 
EPM also implemented control standards and processes that are suited for its industrial minerals production activities. For example, it has a separate team dedicated to quality that works with the research & development team and directly with plants to constantly test incoming ores and finished products.
EPM's diatomaceous earth and perlite products are classified as “Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)" by the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") when they are used in food processing as filtration media. To best position ourselves with certain end-users, EPM filter aids and functional additives comply with the respective specifications of the U.S. Food Chemical Codex (FCC). This regulatory body focuses on food safety by maintaining strict standards on diatomaceous earth and perlite products that come in contact with food and beverage goods, and according to customer specifications.
Distribution
We ship our commercial silica products direct to our customers by truck, rail or barge and through our network of in-basin transloads. Recent trends in the oil and gas market and the expansion of our logistics footprint have resulted in more of our product volumes being transported by high-efficiency unit trains over the past two years. During 2018, we shipped 421-unit trains to both our transload sites and our customers. Our 2016 acquisition of Sandbox extended our delivery capability directly to our customers' wellhead locations, which increases efficiency and provides a lower cost logistics solution for certain of our customers. Sandbox has operations in the major United States oil and gas producing regions, including Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, the Rocky Mountains and the Northeast, where their largest customers are located.
For bulk commercial silica, transportation cost represents a significant portion of the overall product cost. Generally, we utilize trucks for shipments of 200 miles or less from our plant sites and to distribute our bagged products. Given the weight-to-value ratio of most of our products, the majority of our shipments outside this 200-mile radius are by rail or barge. As a result, facility location is one of the most important considerations for producers and customers. Generally, our plant sites are 
9

strategically located to provide access to rail and/or barge, which enables us to cost effectively send product to each of the strategic basins in North America.
We continually look to optimize our network to position product close to the point of end use. This approach is designed to allows us to provide strong customer service and positions us to take advantage of opportunistic spot market sales. As of December 31, 2018, we have 51 transload facilities strategically located in or near all major shale basins in the United States. For more information related to our transload facilities, see Item 2. Properties.
Both we and our customers lease a significant number of railcars for shipping purposes, as well as to facilitate the short-term storage of our products, particularly our frac sand products. As of December 31, 2018, we leased a fleet of 7,823 railcars, of which 1,461 cars were in storage. 
In addition to bulk shipments, commercial silica products can be packaged and shipped in 50- to 100-pound bags or bulk super sacks. Bag shipments are usually made to smaller customers with batch operations, warehouse distributor locations or for ocean container shipments made overseas. The products that are shipped in bags are often higher value products, such as ground and fine.
Diatomaceous earth, clay, and perlite facilities are located near major highways and export corridors to optimize the cost of operations and shipment. Products can be shipped via bulk truck and rail. Products can also be packaged and shipped in jugs, 25- to 50-pound bags or bulk super sacks. Packaged shipment can be made via common carriers for the North/South American markets and intermodal carriers to ports for shipment overseas. We utilize experienced in-house international logistics operations using a broad base of steamship partners to enable efficient and cost-effective exports to approximately 100 countries.
 Primary End Markets 
The special properties of commercial silica-chemistry, purity, grain size, color, inertness, hardness and resistance to high temperatures-make it critical to a variety of industries. Commercial silica is a key input in the well completion process, specifically, in the hydraulic fracturing techniques used in unconventional oil and natural gas wells. In the industrial and specialty products end markets, stringent quality requirements must be met when commercial silica is used as an ingredient to produce thousands of everyday products, including glass, building and foundry products and metal castings, as well as certain specialty applications such high-performance glass, specialty coatings, polymer additives and geothermal energy systems. Due to the unique properties of commercial silica, we believe it is an economically irreplaceable raw material in a wide range of industrial applications. 
High quality diatomaceous earth (DE) possesses superior characteristics for filtration and for functional additives. The
perlite (hydrated volcanic glass) is used for filtration, lightweight construction, horticulture and insulation. The calcium
bentonite clay from Mississippi and calcium montmorillonite clay from Tennessee are thermally processed to produce powder and granular products for bleaching clays, absorbents, catalysis, and adsorbents.
Our major end markets include: 
Oil and Gas Proppants
Commercial silica is used as a proppant for oil and natural gas recovery in conventional and unconventional resource plays. Unconventional oil and natural gas production requires hydraulic fracturing and other well stimulation techniques to recover oil or natural gas that is trapped in the source rock and typically involves horizontal drilling. Frac sand is pumped down oil and natural gas wells at high pressures to prop open rock fissures in order to increase the flow rate of hydrocarbons from the wells. Proppants are also used in the "refracturing" process where older wells are restimulated using newer technologies and additional frac sand as a viable and lower-cost alternative to drilling new wells. Oil and gas horizontal rig count in North America increased during 2017 and 2018, leading to more well completion activity. 
Glass 
Commercial silica is a critical input into and accounts for 55% to 75% of the raw materials in glass production. The glassmaking markets served by commercial silica producers include containers, flat glass, specialty glass and fiberglass. Demand typically varies within each of these end markets. 
The container glass, flat glass and fiberglass end markets are generally mature end markets. Demand for container glass has historically grown in line with population growth, and we expect similar growth in the future. Flat glass and fiberglass tend to be correlated with construction and automotive production activity. To the extent construction and domestic automotive production activity grow in the coming years, we expect that demand in these end markets will continue to increase. Some of the anticipated growth in the glass markets may be offset through the use of recycled glass.

Building Products 
Commercial silica is used in the manufacturing of building products for commercial and residential construction. Whole grain commercial silica products are used in flooring compounds, mortars and grouts, specialty cements, stucco and roofing shingles. Ground commercial silica products are used by building products manufacturers in the manufacturing of certain fiberglass products and as functional extenders and to add durability and weathering properties to cementious compounds. In addition, geothermal wells,an alternative energy source, require specialized ground silica products in their well casings for effectiveness. The market for commercial silica used to manufacture building products is driven primarily by the demand in the construction markets. The historical trend for this market has been one of growth, especially in demand for cementious compounds for new construction, renovation and repair. We have seen an increase in permits and housing starts since 2012, and those gains continued in 2018. To the extent the housing market growth continues in the coming years, we expect that demand in this end market will increase. 
Foundry 
Commercial silica products are used in the production of molds for metal castings and in metal casting products. In addition, commercial whole grain silica is sold to coaters of foundry silica, or coated internally, who then sell their product to foundries for cores and shell casting processes. The demand for foundry silica primarily depends on the rate of automobile and light truck production, construction and production of heavy equipment such as rail cars. Over the past decade, there has been some movement of foundry supply chains to Mexico and other offshore production areas. We have experienced increases in foundry demand since 2011. During 2018, several of the foundry markets continued to see growth. To the extent production levels continue to strengthen in the coming years, we expect that demand in this end market will increase.
Chemicals
Both whole grain and ground silica products are used in the manufacturing of silicon-based chemicals, such as sodium silicate, that are used in a variety of applications, including food processing, detergent products, paper textile, specialty foundry applications and as inputs for some precipitated silicas. This end market is driven by the development of new products by the chemical manufacturers, including specialty coatings and polymer additives as well as the growth of “green” tires. We expect this end market to grow if and to the extent these manufacturers continue their product and applications development. 
Fillers and Extenders 
Commercial silica products are sold to producers of paints and coating products for use as fillers and extenders in architectural, industrial and traffic paints and are sold to producers of rubber and plastic for use in the production of epoxy molding compounds and silicone rubber. The commercial silica products used in this end market are most often ground silica, including finer ground classifications. The market for fillers and extenders is driven by demand in the construction and automotive production industries as well as by demand for materials in the housing remodeling industry. We have experienced increases in demand in these sectors since 2011. To the extent these industries continue to grow in the coming years, we expect demand to increase. 
Filtration 
Diatomaceous earth and perlite filter aid products are used to filter and purify unwanted solids from a variety of liquids including wine, beer, juice, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, swimming pools and edible oil. 
Absorbents
Diatomaceous earth and montmorillonite clay are used for absorbent products used for small floor spills,large scale industrial accidents, hazardous waste spills, pet litter and in the automotive industry.
Functional Additives

Solid acid catalysts are environmentally-friendly products that eliminate the need for liquid acid. These products are used in the oil and gas and chemical industries. 
Our Customers
We sell our products to a variety of end markets. Our customers in the oil and gas proppants end market include major oilfield services companies and exploration and production companies that are engaged in hydraulic fracturing. Sales to the oil and gas proppants end market comprised approximately 75%, 82%, and 65% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
During most of our 119-year history, our primary markets have been core industrial end markets with customers engaged in the production of glass, building products, foundry products, chemicals and fillers and extenders. Our diverse customer base drives high recovery rates across our production. We also benefit from strong and long-standing relationships with our customers in each of the industrial and specialty products end markets we serve. Through our acquisition of EPM, we also serve a variety of industrial mineral markets including pool filtration, paints and plastics, absorbents and food and beverage. Sales to our industrial and specialty products end markets comprised approximately 25%, 18%, and 35% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 Sales to one customer in the Oil & Gas Proppant end market accounted for 15% of our total sales in 2018. Sales to two of our largest customers in the Oil & Gas Proppant end market accounted for 15% and 12% of our total sales in 2017. Sales to one of our largest customers in the Oil & Gas Proppant end market accounted for 13% of our total sales in 2016. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Competition 
Both of our reportable segments operate in highly competitive markets that are characterized by a small number of large, national producers and a larger number of small, regional or local producers. According to a January 2018 publication by the United States Geological Survey, in 2017, there were 200 producers of commercial silica with a combined 340 active operations in 35 states within the United States. Competition for both of our reportable segments is based on price, consistency and quality of product, site location, distribution capability, customer service, reliability of supply, breadth of product offering and technical support. Because transportation costs are a significant portion of the total cost to customers of commercial silica (in many instances transportation costs can represent more than 50% of delivered cost), the commercial silica market is typically local, and competition from beyond the local area is limited. Notable exceptions to this are the frac sand and fillers and extenders markets, where certain product characteristics are not available in all deposits and not all plants have the requisite processing capabilities, necessitating that some products be shipped for extended distances. We compete with national producers such as Covia Holdings Corporation, Hi-Crush Partners LP and Emerge Energy Services LP. Because the markets for our products are typically local, we also compete with smaller, regional or local producers in each of the regions in which we operate. For more information regarding competition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
Seasonality
 Our business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations in weather that impact our production levels and our customers' business needs. For example, during the second and third quarters we sell more commercial silica to our customers in the building products and recreation end markets due to increased construction activity resulting from more favorable 
12

weather. In the first and fourth quarters, we can experience lower sales, and sometimes production levels, largely from adverse weather hampering logistical capabilities and general decreased customer activity levels.
Intellectual Property
Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities, there are no third-party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. Our intellectual property primarily consists of trade secrets, know-how and trademarks, including our name US SILICA® and products with trademarked names such as OTTAWA WHITE®, MIN-U-SIL®, MYSTIC WHITE II®, Q-ROK®, SIL-CO-SIL®, PREMIUM HICKORY®, US SILICA WHITE®, InnoProp, EP Minerals® and SANDBOX® among others. We own patents and have patent applications pending related to Sandbox, our "last mile" logistics solution. Most of the issued patents have an expiration date after August 20, 2027 with a majority of issued patents expiring after December 21, 2031. With respect to our other products, we principally rely on trade secrets, rather than patents, to protect our proprietary processes, methods, documentation and other technologies, as well as certain other business information. Although we do seek patents from time to time, patent protection requires a costly and uncertain federal registration process that would place our confidential information in the public domain. As a result, we typically utilize trade secrets to protect the formulations and processes we use to manufacture our products and to safeguard our proprietary formulations and methods. We attempt to protect our trade secrets indefinitely through the use of confidentiality agreements and other security measures, but these efforts could prove to be ineffective. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information. 
Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance 
Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization and/or expansion of equipment and facilities. For more information, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against other risks that are typical in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information. 
Commercial Team 
Our commercial team consists of approximately 293 individuals responsible for all aspects of our sales process, including pricing, marketing, transportation and logistics, product development and general customer service. This necessitates a highly organized staff and extensive coordination between departments. For example, product development requires the collaboration of our market development team, sales team, our production facilities and our corporate laboratories. Our sales team interacts directly with our customers in determining their needs, our production facilities fulfill the orders and our corporate laboratories are responsible for ensuring that our products meet those needs.
Our commercial team can be divided into five units: 

• | Sales—Our sales team is organized by both region and end market. We have an experienced group of dedicated sales team members for the oil and gas proppants and the industrial and specialty products end markets. Our oil and gas proppants team is led out of our Katy and Houston offices and is regionally positioned in the major oil and gas markets across the United States. This staff consists of experienced experts in the use of frac proppants in the oil and gas industry. Our industrial and specialty products sales team is strategically located across the county and overseas near our major customers. As we make decisions to enter or expand our presence in certain end markets or regions, we expect we will continue to add dedicated team members to support that growth.


• | Marketing—Our marketing team coordinates all of our new and existing customer outreach efforts and identifies emerging market trends and new product opportunities. This includes producing exhibits for trade shows and exhibitions, manufacturing product overview materials, participating in regional industry meetings and other trade associations and managing our advertising efforts in trade journals.


• | Transportation and Logistics—Our transportation and logistics team manages domestic and international shipments and wellhead deliveries of frac sand by directing inbound and outbound rail, barge, ocean vessel and truck traffic, supervising equipment maintenance, coordinating with freight carriers to ensure equipment availability, ensuring compliance with shipping regulations and strategically planning for future growth.

13


• | Technical—Our technical team is anchored by our industrial & specialty products laboratory in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia and our research and development laboratory in Reno, Nevada. At these facilities, we perform a variety of analyses including:


• | analytical chemistry by X-Ray Fluorescence (“XRF”) and Inductively Coupled Plasma (“ICP”) spectroscopy;


• | particle characterization by sieve, SediGraph, Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (“BET”) surface area and microscopy;


• | ore evaluation by mineral processing, flotation and magnetic separation;


• | API frac sand evaluation, including crush resistance; and


• | American Foundry Society (“AFS”) green sand evaluation by various foundry sand tests.

Many other product analyses are performed locally at our 27 production facilities to support new product development, plant operations and customer quality requirements. 
We also have a variety of other technical competencies including process engineering, equipment design, facility construction, maintenance excellence, environmental engineering, geology and mine planning and development. We believe effective integration of these capabilities has been a critical component of our business success and has allowed us to establish and maintain our reserve base, maximize the value of our reserves by producing and selling a wide range of products, optimize processing costs to provide strong value to customers and prioritize operating in a safe and environmentally sustainable manner.
In addition, our Reno, Nevada research and development laboratory is fully equipped with state-of-the-art research instruments. R&D and technical experts provide the following capabilities for customers:

◦ | Expert geologists and engineers for desirable ore-body and processing evaluations;


◦ | Material analysis and formulation assistance by Ph.D. chemists; and


◦ | An array of testing capabilities


• | Customer Service—Our customer service team is dedicated to creating an exceptional customer experience and making it easy to do business with our company. Our customer service team aims to accomplish this by consistently exceeding our customers’ expectations, continually improving our performance, offering efficient and timely responses to customer needs, being available to our customers 24/7 and providing customers with personal points of contact on whom they can rely.

 Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed a workforce of approximately 2,812 employees, the majority of whom are hourly wage plant workers living in the areas surrounding our mining facilities. The majority of our hourly employees are represented by labor unions that include the Teamsters Union; United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union; Laborers International Union of North America; Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics and Allied Workers International Union; Cement, Lime, Gypsum and Allied Workers’ Division of International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers; and International Union of Operating Engineers A.F.L. - C.I.O. We believe that we maintain good relations with our workers and their respective unions and have not experienced any material strikes or work stoppages since 1987. 
Our employees average approximately seven years of tenure with us, and we have an annual employee turnover rate of 29%, excluding the impact of reductions in workforce as part of our restructuring actions during market downturns. We believe this represents a relatively stable workforce in our industry, and that this stable workforce has directly contributed to improved process efficiencies and safety, which in turn help drive cost reductions. We believe our labor rates compare favorably to other mining and manufacturing facilities in the same geographic areas. We maintain workers’ compensation coverage in amounts required by law and have no material claims pending. We also offer all full-time employees a competitive package of employee benefits, which includes medical, dental, life and disability coverage.

Regulation and Legislation 
Mining and Workplace Safety
Federal Regulation
The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) is the primary regulatory organization governing the commercial silica industry. Accordingly, MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with quarries and mines. The mission of MSHA is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the "Mine Act") and to enforce compliance with mandatory safety and health standards. MSHA works closely with the Industrial Minerals Association, a trade association in which we have a significant leadership role, in pursuing this mission. As part of MSHA’s oversight, representatives perform at least two unannounced inspections annually for each above-ground facility. For additional information regarding mining and workplace safety, including MSHA safety and health violations and assessments in 2018, see Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.
We also are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. OSHA regulates the customers and users of commercial silica and provides detailed regulations requiring employers to protect employees from overexposure to silica bearing dust through the enforcement of permissible exposure limits and the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard.
Internal Controls
We adhere to a strict occupational health program aimed at controlling exposure to silica bearing dust, which includes dust sampling, a respiratory protection program, medical surveillance, training and other components. Our safety program is designed to ensure compliance with the standards of our Occupational Health and Safety Manual and MSHA regulations. For both health and safety issues, extensive training is provided to employees. We have safety committees at our plants made up of salaried and hourly employees. We perform annual internal health and safety audits and conduct annual crisis management drills to test our plants’ abilities to respond to various situations. Health and safety programs are administered by our corporate health and safety department with the assistance of plant Environmental, Health and Safety Coordinators.
Motor Carrier Regulation
Our trucking services are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT"), the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ("FMCSA") and by various state agencies. These regulatory authorities have broad powers, generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations, as well as motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers, transportation of hazardous materials and periodic financial reporting. In addition, each driver is required to have a commercial driver’s license and may be subject to mandatory drug and alcohol testing. We may be audited periodically by these regulatory authorities to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations.
The transportation industry is subject to possible other regulatory and legislative changes (such as the possibility of more stringent environmental, climate change, security and/or occupational safety and health regulations, limits on vehicle weight and size and a mandate to implement electronic logging devices) that may affect the economics of our trucking services by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for motor carrier services or the cost of providing truckload or other transportation or logistics services.
Environmental Matters
We and the commercial silica industry in general are subject to extensive governmental regulation on, among other things, matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, hazardous materials, air and water emissions and environmental contamination and reclamation. A variety of state, local and federal agencies enforce this regulation.
Federal Regulation
At the federal level, we may be required to obtain permits under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands and streams, in connection with our operations. We also may be required to obtain permits under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) (or the relevant state environmental agency in states where the permit program has been delegated to the state) for discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States, including 
15

discharges of wastewater or storm water runoff associated with construction activities. Failure to obtain these required permits or to comply with their terms could subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief.
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”) regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control Program (the “UIC Program”). Hydraulic fracturing generally has been exempt from federal regulation under the UIC Program, and the hydraulic fracturing process has been typically regulated by state or local governmental authorities. The EPA, however, has taken the position that certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel may be subject to regulation under the UIC Program, specifically as “Class II” UIC wells. In February 2014, the EPA released an interpretive memorandum to clarify UIC Program requirements under the SDWA for underground injection of diesel fuels in hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas extraction and issued technical guidance containing recommendations for EPA permit writers to consider in implementing these UIC “Class II” requirements. Among other things, the memorandum and technical guidance clarified that any owner or operator who injects diesel fuels in hydraulic fracturing for oil or gas extraction must obtain a UIC “Class II” permit before injection.
In 2012 the EPA issued final rules that included the first federal air standards for natural gas and oil wells that are hydraulically fractured, along with other requirements for several other sources of pollution in the oil and gas industry that had not been regulated at the federal level. Building on the 2012 rules, the EPA announced in May 2016 additional regulations to reduce methane and smog-forming emissions from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas industry. In June 2017, the EPA issued two proposals to stay certain of these requirements and reconsider the entirety of the 2016 rules; however, the rules currently remain in effect. Also in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry.
Additionally, the EPA published in May 2014 an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. In June 2016, the EPA finalized effluent limit guidelines that waste water from shale resource extraction operations must meet before discharging to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Subsequently, compliance dates for certain sources have been extended by the EPA.
In 2011, a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives (the “House”) and a subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board (the “SEAB”) of the U.S. Department of Energy (“US DOE”) each undertook inquiries related to the practices and effects of hydraulic fracturing, with each concluding that hydraulic fracturing created regulatory concerns and, in addition to regulations already discussed, could potentially spur further regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. In December 2016, the EPA issued a final assessment of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater that found hydraulic fracturing may in some cases result in impacts to drinking water resources. Additionally, from time to time, legislation is introduced before the U.S. Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. If this or similar legislation becomes law, the legislation could establish an additional level of federal regulation that may lead to additional permitting requirements or other operating restrictions, making it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells in shale formations. This could increase our customers’ costs of compliance and doing business or otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which may negatively impact demand for our frac sand products.
In March 2015, the federal Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") published a final rule that established new or more stringent standards for hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian land. After several rounds of litigation, BLM rescinded this rule in December 2017; however, the rescission is currently being challenged in court. BLM also issued final rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on public lands in November 2016; however, in December 2017, BLM postponed compliance requirements for certain provisions of the 2016 methane venting rule. BLM’s December 2017 delay decision is also currently being challenged in court.
The U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. These regulatory programs may require us to install expensive emissions abatement equipment, modify our operational practices and obtain permits for our existing operations, and before commencing construction on a new or modified source of air emissions, such laws may require us to reduce emissions at existing facilities. As a result, we may be required to incur increased capital and operating costs because of these regulations. We could be subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations.
As part of our operations, we utilize or store petroleum products and other substances such as diesel fuel, lubricating oils and hydraulic fluid. We are subject to applicable requirements regarding the storage, use, transportation and disposal of these substances, including the relevant Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure requirements that the EPA imposes on us. Spills or releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including those relating to claims for damage or injury to property and persons.
16

Additionally, some of our operations are located on properties that historically have been used in ways that resulted in the release of contaminants, including hazardous substances, into the environment, and we could be held liable for the remediation of such historical contamination. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
In addition, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. In the course of our operations, we generate industrial solid wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes.
Our operations may also be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all “major federal actions” significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The granting of a federal permit for a major development project, such as a mining operation, may be considered a “major federal action” that requires review under NEPA. Therefore, our projects may require review and evaluation under NEPA. As part of this evaluation, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among other things, impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife (including threatened and endangered species), historical and archaeological resources, geology, socioeconomics and aesthetics. NEPA also requires the consideration of alternatives to the project. The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, can be time consuming and expensive. The purpose of the NEPA review process is to inform federal agencies’ decision-making on whether federal approval should be granted for a project and to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of a proposed project. While NEPA requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not mandate a result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit, or impose certain conditions on its approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party may challenge the adequacy of a NEPA review.
Federal agencies granting permits for our operations also must consider impacts to endangered and threatened species and their habitat under the Endangered Species Act. We also must comply with and are subject to liability under the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for the harming of endangered or threatened species and their habitat. Federal agencies also must consider a project’s impacts on historic or archaeological resources under the National Historic Preservation Act, and we may be required to conduct archaeological surveys of project sites and to avoid or preserve historical areas or artifacts.
State and Local Regulation
Because our operations are located in numerous states, we are also subject to a variety of different state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states in which our projects are located or are being developed have state laws similar to NEPA; thus, our development of new sites or the expansion of existing sites may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if they are not subject to NEPA. In some cases, the state environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review. Our operations may require state law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations and scenic areas. Some states also have specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and states may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building and transportation requirements.
As demand for frac sand in the oil and natural gas industry has driven a significant increase in current and expected future production of commercial silica, some local communities have expressed concern regarding silica sand mining operations. These concerns have generally included exposure to ambient silica sand dust, truck traffic, water usage and blasting. In response, certain state and local communities have developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize dust from getting airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly curtail the amount of practicable area for mining activities, provide compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining activities and, in some cases, ban issuance of new permits for mining activities. To date, we have not experienced any material impact or disruption to our existing mining operations or planned capacity expansions as a result of these types of concerns.
17

We have a long history of positive engagement with the communities that surround our existing mining operations. We believe our relatively stable workforce and strong relationship with our employees help foster good relations with the communities in which we operate. Although additional regulatory requirements could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, we believe our existing operations may be less likely to be negatively impacted by virtue of our good community relations.
Planned expansion of our mining and production capacity in new communities could be more significantly impacted by increased regulatory activity. Difficulty or delays in obtaining or inability to obtain new mining permits or increased costs of compliance with future state and local regulatory requirements could have a material negative impact on our ability to grow our business. In an effort to minimize these risks, we continue to be engaged with local communities in order to grow and maintain strong relationships with residents and regulators.
Costs of Compliance
We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our activities. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory, cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also increase the cost of the development, construction and operation of our projects and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given project. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property may result from environmental and other impacts of our activities.
The process for performing environmental impact studies and reviews for federal, state and local permits for our operations involves a significant investment of time and monetary resources. We cannot control the permit approval process. We cannot predict whether all permits required for a given project will be granted or whether such permits will be the subject of significant opposition. The denial of a permit essential to a project or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop a project. Significant opposition and delay in the environmental review and permitting process also could impair or delay our ability to develop a project. Additionally, the passage of more stringent environmental laws could impair our ability to develop new operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations We do not expect any material capital expenditures due to current regulatory compliance obligations.
