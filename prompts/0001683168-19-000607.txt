ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
The company was founded in 2001 as 3PEA Technologies, Inc. In March 2006, we completed a reverse-merger with a non-operating public company named Tika Corporation which was originally incorporated in Nevada as G.K.W., Inc. on August 24, 1995. As a result of the reverse-merger, 3PEA Technologies, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tika Corporation. We changed our name to Paypad Inc. on March 13, 2006. On October 19, 2006, we changed our name to 3PEA International, Inc. In 2007, we acquired control of Wow Technologies, Inc., a payment solutions company with a proprietary card processing platform, in a share exchange agreement whereby Wow Technologies, Inc. became our majority-owned subsidiary.
 
The business of 3PEA Technologies, Inc., both before and after we acquired it, was the development of a secure payment gateway and hardware device which utilized encryption technology and secure key exchange to facilitate PIN debit transactions over the internet. We developed proprietary stored value systems, secure key loading systems, and acted as an encryption service organization injecting keys into its proprietary payment terminal called the PayPad®. Users could connect the device to their computers and utilize it to make purchases over the internet without having to provide their credit card and other personal information to the seller. Due to the lack of market acceptance of this concept, we ultimately determined to discontinue the product. We successfully adapted our payment platform to alternatively support prepaid debit cards, which is our current business.
 
Business of Issuer
 
3PEA International, Inc. is a vertically integrated provider of innovative prepaid card programs and processing services for corporate, consumer and government applications. Our payment solutions are utilized by our corporate customers as a means to increase customer loyalty, increase patient adherence rates, reduce administration costs and streamline operations. Public sector organizations can utilize our payment solutions to disburse public benefits or for internal payments. We market our prepaid card solutions under our PaySign brand. As we are a payment processor and prepaid card program manager, we derive our revenue from all stages of the prepaid card lifecycle. We provide a card processing platform consisting of proprietary systems and innovative software applications based on the unique needs of our clients. We have extended our processing business capabilities through our proprietary PaySign platform. Through the PaySign platform, we provide a variety of services including transaction processing, cardholder enrollment, value loading, cardholder account management, reporting, and customer service.
 
The PaySign platform was built on modern cross-platform architecture and designed to be highly flexible, scalable and customizable. The platform has allowed 3PEA to significantly expand its operational capabilities by facilitating our entry into new markets within the payments space through its flexibility and ease of customization. The PaySign platform delivers cost benefits and revenue building opportunities to our partners.
 
We have developed prepaid card programs for corporate incentive and rewards including, but not limited to, consumer rebates and rewards, donor compensation, healthcare reimbursement payments and pharmaceutical payment assistance. We are expanding our product offerings to include additional corporate incentive products, payroll cards, demand deposit accounts accessible with a debit card, travel cards, and expense reimbursement cards. Our cards are sponsored by our issuing bank partners.
 
We manage all aspects of the debit card lifecycle, from managing the card design and approval processes with partners and networks, to production, packaging, distribution, and personalization. We also oversee inventory and security controls, renewals, lost and stolen card management and replacement. We deploy a fully staffed, in-house customer service department which utilizes bi-lingual customer service representatives, Interactive Voice Response (“IVR”), and two-way short message service (“SMS”) messaging.

To date, we have issued millions of prepaid debit cards under programs implemented for Fortune 500 companies, multinationals, as well as top pharmaceutical manufacturers, universities and social media companies.
 
Depending on the program selected by the client, we generate the following types of revenues: setup charges; customized software development fees; data processing and report generation fees; transaction fees from each transaction by a cardholder; interchange fees; card fulfillment fees; fees related to customer service and administrative fees.
 
What Are Prepaid Cards?
 
Prepaid debit cards are issued by a financial institution and are loaded with funds and are used like a normal debit card. Prepaid debit cards are generally network branded (Amex, Discover, MasterCard, Visa) and can be used anywhere the card brand is accepted. Network branded prepaid cards provide consumers, businesses and governments with the efficiency, security and flexibility of digital payments through a non-credit payment option and provide the end user security against fraud and theft.
 
While these cards work like traditional debit/credit cards and offer many of the same fraud and loss protections, they access funds that have been loaded onto the card by either the cardholder, another person (as a gift), the government for benefits, employers/corporations for payroll, or by a corporation for rewards/incentives or health benefits. As a non-credit payment tool, they help users control their budget.
 
According to The Federal Reserve Payments Study: 2018 Annual Supplement, prepaid card payments reached 13.1 billion payments by number with a value of $0.30 trillion in 2017. In the same report, general purpose reloadable card payments (“GPR”) reached 112.6 billion payments by numbers with a value of $6.06 trillion in 2017.
 
Today, millions of Americans use network branded prepaid cards for the choice and protection they provide, including the estimated 43 million un-banked or underbanked (source: 2017 National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households: FDIC October 2018) who would not otherwise have a way to participate in our card-based economy, parents of college-aged students who want a safe and secure way to give money without the risk of running up debt, and recipients of government benefits who need an efficient way to receive their welfare payments, child support payments, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program payments or unemployment payments.
 
Types of Cards
 
This increasingly popular financial product comes in many forms. Here are some examples to understand how they are used.
 
General Purpose Reloadable: A type of prepaid card typically purchased by a consumer for his/her personal use to pay for purchases, pay bills and/or access cash at ATMs. GPR cards may be purchased online and in retail locations from a variety of providers. Funds may be loaded onto the card by direct deposit of wages or benefits or at retail locations offering prepaid card reload services.
 
Recently, providers of GPR card products, in response to changes in the regulatory environment, have introduced new products similar to a GPR but that act as a true demand deposit account accessible with a debit card (“DDA Debit Card”), offering many of the features and functionalities of a debit card associated to a standard bank account including overdraft protection. The Company is focused on entering the Consumer market with a DDA Debit Card to be marketed as PaySign Premier, which will include all the functionalities discussed above.
 
Payroll: A prepaid card that is directly or indirectly established through an employer and to which electronic fund transfers of the cardholder's wages, salary, or other employee compensation (such as commissions), are made on a recurring basis.

Corporate Incentive Cards: A prepaid card that is provided to a consumer or potential consumer as an incentive to, or reward for purchasing a product or completing a task, such as completing a survey, adhering to a brand name drug regimen or test driving a vehicle. Payments can also be made by a company to an employee or agent as an incentive bonus.
 
Health Care: Pre-tax benefit cards linked to Health Savings Accounts (HSA), Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) or Healthcare Reimbursement Accounts (HRA, which contain funds that can be used to pay for current or future medical expenses. Pharmaceutical companies also employ prepaid card programs to increase patient enrolment and adherence to a brand name drug through co-pay assist and buy and bill programs.
 
Government Disbursement Cards: Prepaid cards used for the purpose of disbursing government payments such as Social Security payments, disability payments, disaster relief payments, WIC or Food Stamp disbursements or government payroll.
 
Gift Cards: A prepaid card that is purchased by a gift giver to be given to a gift recipient.
 
Per Diem, Corporate Expense and Business Travel Cards: A reloadable card that allows businesses, non–profits and government agencies the ability to control employee spending while reducing administration costs by eliminating the need for traditional expense reports and eliminates the risks and expenses of handling paper checks and cash.
 
Our Products and Services
 
We are a vertically integrated payment processor and debit card program manager offering innovative payment solutions to corporations, government agencies, universities and other organizations. Our payment solutions are utilized by our customers as a means to increase customer loyalty, increase brand recognition, reward customers, agents and employees while reducing administration costs and streamlining operations. We market our prepaid debit card solutions under our PaySign® brand of prepaid cards. As we are a payment processor and debit card program manager, we derive our revenue from all stages of the debit card lifecycle. These revenues can include fees from program set-up; customization and development; data processing and report generation; card production and fulfillment; transaction fees derived from card usage; inactivity fees; card replacement fees and program administration fees. We provide in-house customer service which includes live bilingual customer care representatives staffed 24/7/365. We also run in-house Interactive Voice Response and two way SMS messaging platforms. Our cards are offered to end users through our relationships with bank issuers.
 
In our early years of operations, we focused mainly on providing co-pay assistance prepaid cards to the pharmaceutical industry. In 2011, we began marketing a corporate incentive prepaid card based payment solution targeting the plasma donation industry. More recently, having built the necessary infrastructure and adding essential staff, we have increased our focus and sales efforts on corporate incentive and corporate expense card programs as well as retargeting the pharmaceutical industry with co-pay assistance, buy and bill and other prepaid programs designed to maximize patient enrollment, adherence and retention. In late 2018, we began to devote more resources to card programs used by the pharmaceutical industry, and we expect significant contributions to revenue and gross margins from these pharmaceutical programs commencing in the first quarter of 2019.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had over 2.25 million cardholders participating in 250 card programs.
 
The PaySign Brand
 
In order to leverage the capabilities of the PaySign platform and successfully expand our product offerings, we established the PaySign brand of prepaid cards and solutions. The PaySign brand encompasses the entirety of our current and future prepaid product offerings, including but not limited to, corporate incentives, healthcare related payment solutions for clinical trials, donations and co-pay assistance, payroll, settlement payments, corporate expense cards and solutions designed for the public sector as well as general spend reloadable prepaid cards.

Corporate Incentives
 
Our PaySign corporate incentive cards offer businesses a practical and contemporary way to reward and motivate existing and potential customers, employees, donors, patients, participants in clinical trials, sales professionals, agents and distributors. We develop incentive card programs, either traditional plastic or virtual, that our customers use for a wide variety of applications, including but not limited to: consumer rebates for large purchases or frequent buyers; trade incentives for third party distributors, new product launches and commission based sales incentives; consumer promotions such as automobile test drives; purchase incentives; loyalty rewards; compensation for time and effort of donating, pharmaceutical payment assistance, referral programs, event giveaways and purchase incentives. The PaySign solution can be integrated into existing payment management systems or as act as a stand-alone solution. The PaySign Card is accepted anywhere Visa is accepted.
 
Key benefits of our corporate incentive cards are:
 

· | Cost savings
--+-------------

 
Operating and administrative costs associated with processing traditional paper checks are reduced.
 

· | Co-Branding
--+------------

 
Our clients can promote their brands as the card can include the corporate sponsor’s logo. The card itself acts as a wallet sized billboard.
 

· | Customization
--+--------------

 
Our PaySign platform allows for easy customization of our corporate incentive card products. For example, our clients can select merchants or merchant categories which dictate where the card will be accepted. Our clients can receive customized reports, track card usage and attach surveys to the activation process to gain market intelligence.
 

· | Speed to Market
--+----------------

 
Our clients can get rewards and incentives to the intended recipients in a much quicker manner than traditional methods using our corporate incentive card products.
  
Per Diem/ Corporate Expense Payments
 
Per Diem, Corporate Expense and Business Travel Cards: A reloadable prepaid card that allows businesses, non –profits and government agencies the ability to control employee spending while reducing administration costs by eliminating the need for traditional expense reports. 3PEA is currently focusing on marketing these card products to large corporations.
Pharmaceutical Market
 
Our PaySign solutions for the pharmaceutical industry are a specialized, adjudicated solution that off-sets a patient’s out-of-pocket costs associated with a prescription drug purchase. Funds are provided by the sponsoring pharmaceutical company for use at retail pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, hospitals, Doctor’s offices and clinics nationwide.

4
-

 

Our pharmaceutical solutions provide payment claims processing and other administrative services for clients, in real-time, according to client benefit plan designs. Our solutions present a cost-effective payment delivery vehicle by providing real-time financial benefit for both consumers and sponsors. Our offerings also allow clients to directly manage more of their pharmacy benefits and include pharmacy claims adjudication, network and payment administration, client call center service and support, reporting, rebate management, as well as implementation, training and account management.
 
Co-Pay Assistance Program
 
Our Co-Pay Payment Program is a pharmaceutical payment card which is adjudicated as a secondary claim at the point of purchase. The adjudication process determines what funds will be loaded onto the card by applying business rules designed by the sponsoring company. The loaded funds are then immediately applied to the prescription purchase at the point of purchase for the patient benefit. The card is used to defer out-of-pocket costs for the prescription. Key features and benefits of our PaySign Card for the Co-Pay Payment Program are:

· | Tracking and auditing "free samples" is no longer required, as the retail pharmacy network serves as the distribution mechanism for new prescriber promotions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The patient's primary insurance pays the standard adjudicated amount for prescription fills that would historically be "free samples".
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The distribution of cards enables far superior prescriber and patient data collection for the sponsoring pharmaceutical company through the use of automated questionnaires required to activate the cards.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The marketing programs can be better designed exactly to meet the specifications and needs of the sponsoring pharmaceutical company, as compared to programs involving the distribution of physical samples.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Because the card operates like a debit card, pharmacy retailers are paid instantly for the adjudicated promotional cost on covered prescription transactions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We provide a set of comprehensive, customizable reporting modules to our pharmaceutical clients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Buy and Bill Program
 
Where PaySign’s standard pharmaceutical Co-Pay assistance Cards provide payment for self-administered pharmaceuticals purchased at a pharmacy, PaySign’s Buy and Bill Programs are designed to provide a benefit for patients when purchasing directly from their physician’s office or through an infusion center for physician administered therapies.
 
Source Plasma Donor Payments 
 
Plasma derived therapies are lifesaving treatments used to treat various rare conditions. In order for plasma based therapies to be produced, human plasma must be used in its manufacture. Human plasma is the yellow liquid portion of whole blood that can be easily replaced by the body. Plasma makes up approximately 57 percent of whole blood and consists primarily of water and proteins. Source plasma is the plasma collected from volunteer donors that serves as the raw material for the further manufacture into these lifesaving therapies. Historically, source plasma donation centers compensated their donors with cash or checks. In the past several years, plasma donation centers have migrated to a prepaid card based solution for donor payments.

-

 

The Company offers a comprehensive customized payment solution for source plasma collection centers under the PaySign brand. The solution consists of the PaySign Prepaid Debit Card, the PaySign Connect Portal for administrators, and the PaySign Kiosk. The solution offers customized reporting and provides a level of business analytics previously unavailable. The solution can be utilized either as a stand-alone web based solution or integrated with existing donor management system; giving plasma donation centers an increased level of flexibility. The company entered the market in late 2011 and has seen significant growth in this market segment. Currently, the Company services approximately 33% of the plasma collection centers in the US. The company expects our market share to continue to increase.
 
PaySign Premier
 
In response to new regulations, many providers of GPR cards are also offering a debit card which is linked to a demand deposit account (a “DDA Debit Card”) and will allow the cardholder to utilize overdraft protection in cases where the cardholder may spend more than the available balance in the account. Many issuers are actively marketing this product as use of this feature can be a significant source of income for the provider.
 
The Company is expecting to begin marketing its DDA Debit Card, PaySign Premier in 2019. The Company expects to market this product to a targeted portion of its existing cardholder base through existing communication points, as well as to the general public.
 
Other Services
 
Customer Service Center
 
In order to provide a full range of services to our customers, we offer a fully staffed, in-house Customer Service Center which is operational 24 hours a day, 7 days per week consisting of live bi-lingual customer care representatives. The PaySign Platform provides Interactive Voice Response (“IVR”), SMS alerts and two way SMS messaging, allowing cardholders to set alerts and check their balances and history without the assistance of a live customer service operator. We believe our in-house customer service center provides the highest quality customer service experience for our clients as training is performed on-site by 3PEA staff, and the center performs customer service solely for our products and services.
The PaySign Communications Suite
 
To help maximize the cardholder experience, cardholders can access their card balances and transaction history, as well as other information as dictated by the program, such as ATM locator, loyalty point counter, geo-specific messaging through a number of touchpoints such as the PaySign kiosk, the PaySign Mobile App, two way SMS, text alerts and the PaySign cardholder web portal.
Technology
 
Our technology platform employs a standard enterprise services bus in a service-oriented architecture, configured for 24/7/365 operations. We maintain two secure, interconnected, environmentally-controlled data centers, with emergency power generation capabilities, and redundant functionalities. We use a variety of proprietary and licensed standards-based technologies to implement our platforms, including those which provide for orchestration, interoperability and process control. The platforms also integrate a data infrastructure to support both transaction processing and data warehousing for operational support and data analytics.

Competition
 
The markets for financial products and services, including prepaid debit cards and services related thereto, are intensely competitive. We compete with a variety of companies in our markets and our competitors vary in size, scope and breadth of products and services offered. Certain segments of the financial services and healthcare industries tend to be highly fragmented, with numerous companies competing for market share. Highly fragmented segments currently include financial account processing, customer relationship management solutions, electronic funds transfer and prepaid solutions.
 
Many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater financial strength and more recognized brands in the industry. These competitors may be able to attract customers more easily because of their financial resources and awareness in the market. Our larger competitors can also devote substantially more resources to business development and may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. To compete with these companies, we rely primarily on direct marketing strategies including strategic marketing partners.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We market our PaySign payment solutions through direct marketing by the Company’s sales team. Our primary market focus is on companies and municipalities that require a streamlined payment solution for rewards, rebates, payment assistance, and other payments to their customers, employees, agents and others. To reach these markets, we focus our sales efforts on direct contact with our target market and attendance at various industry specific conferences. We may, at times, utilize independent contractors who make direct sales and are paid on a commission basis only.
 
We expect to market our PaySign Premier card through existing communication channels to a targeted segment of our existing cardholders, as well as to a broad group of consumers, ranging from non-banked to fully banked with a focus on long term users of our product.
 
Markets and Major Customers
 
We have no major customers and we are not reliant on any individual program. We manage multiple programs at any given time. As of December 31, 2018, we managed 250 card programs with over 2.25 million participating cardholders.
Regulations
 
Introduction
 
We operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination. Applicable laws and regulations may change, and there is no assurance that such changes will not adversely affect our business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including but not limited to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of financial institutions we may work with. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of restrictions on activities, regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, including but not limited to changes in the regulations governing banks, could have a material impact on our operations.

Our products and services are generally subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including:
 

· | anti-money laundering laws;
--+----------------------------


· | money transfer and payment instrument licensing regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | escheatment laws;
--+------------------


· | privacy and information safeguard laws;
--+----------------------------------------


· | bank regulations;
--+------------------


· | consumer protection laws; and
--+------------------------------


· | false claims laws and other fraud and abuse restrictions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | privacy and security standards under HIPAA or other laws
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 
These laws are often evolving and sometimes ambiguous or inconsistent, and the extent to which they apply to us or the banks that issue our cards, our clients or our third party service providers is at times unclear. Any failure to comply with applicable law — either by us or by the card issuing banks, our client or our third party service providers, over which we have limited legal and practical control — could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services, as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties and the suspension or revocation of a license or registration required to sell our products and services. See "Risk Factors" for additional discussion regarding the potential impacts of changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject and failure to comply with existing or future laws and regulations.
 
We continually monitor and enhance our compliance program to stay current with the most recent legal and regulatory changes. We also continue to implement policies and programs and to adapt our business practices and strategies to help us comply with current legal standards, as well as with new and changing legal requirements affecting particular services or the conduct of our business generally.
 
Anti-Money Laundering Laws
 
Our products and services are generally subject to federal anti-money laundering laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, and similar state laws. On an ongoing basis, these laws require us, among other things, to:

· | report large cash transactions and suspicious activity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | screen transactions against the U.S. government's watch-lists, such as the watch-list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | prevent the processing of transactions to or from certain countries, individuals, nationals and entities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | identify the dollar amounts loaded or transferred at any one time or over specified periods of time, which requires the aggregation of information over multiple transactions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | gather and, in certain circumstances, report customer information;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | comply with consumer disclosure requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | register or obtain licenses with state and federal agencies in the United States and seek registration of any retail distributors when necessary.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anti-money laundering regulations are constantly evolving. We continuously monitor our compliance with anti-money laundering regulations and implement policies and procedures to make our business practices flexible, so we can comply with the most current legal requirements. We cannot predict how these future regulations might affect us. Complying with future regulation could be expensive or require us to change the way we operate our business.
 
Money Transfer and Payment Instrument Licensing Regulations
 
We are not currently subject to money transfer and payment instrument licensing regulations; however, we have plans to introduce products in the future that would be subject to such regulations. Currently, we believe that 39 U.S. jurisdictions would require us to obtain a license to operate a money transfer business. As a licensee, we would be subject to certain restrictions and requirements, including reporting, net worth and surety bonding requirements and requirements for regulatory approval of controlling stockholders, agent locations and consumer forms and disclosures. We would also be subject to inspection by the regulators in the jurisdictions in which we are licensed, many of which conduct regular examinations. In addition, we would be required to maintain "permissible investments" in an amount equivalent to all "outstanding payment obligations."
Escheatment Laws
 
Unclaimed property laws of every U.S. jurisdiction require that we track certain information on our card products and services and that, if customer funds are unclaimed at the end of an applicable statutory abandonment period, the proceeds of the unclaimed property be remitted to the appropriate jurisdiction.
Privacy and Information Safeguard Laws
 
In the ordinary course of our business, we or our third party service providers collect certain types of data, which subjects us to certain privacy and information security laws in the United States, including, for example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, or the GLB Act, and other laws or rules designed to regulate consumer information and mitigate identity theft. We are also subject to privacy laws of various states. These state and federal laws impose obligations with respect to the collection, processing, storage, disposal, use and disclosure of personal information, and require that financial institutions have in place policies regarding information privacy and security. In addition, under federal and certain state financial privacy laws, we must provide notice to consumers of our policies and practices for sharing nonpublic information with third parties, provide advance notice of any changes to our policies and, with limited exceptions, give consumers the right to prevent use of their nonpublic personal information and disclosure of it to unaffiliated third parties. Certain state laws may, in some circumstances, require us to notify affected individuals of security breaches of computer databases that contain their personal information. These laws may also require us to notify state law enforcement, regulators or consumer reporting agencies in the event of a data breach, as well as businesses and governmental agencies that own data. In order to comply with the privacy and information safeguard laws, we have confidentiality/information security standards and procedures in place for our business activities and with our third-party vendors and service providers. Privacy and information security laws evolve regularly, requiring us to adjust our compliance program on an ongoing basis and presenting compliance challenges.
Bank Regulations
 
All of the cards that we service are issued by a state-chartered bank. Thus, we are subject to the oversight of the regulators for, and certain laws applicable to, these card issuing banks. These banking laws require us, as a servicer to the banks that issue our cards, among other things, to undertake compliance actions similar to those described under "– Anti-Money Laundering Laws" above and to comply with the privacy regulations promulgated under the GLB Act as discussed under "– Privacy and Information Safeguard Laws" above.
Consumer Protection Laws
 
Certain products that we anticipate introducing in the future would be subject to state and federal consumer protection laws, including laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive practices, regulating electronic fund transfers and protecting consumer nonpublic information. Before we introduce those products, we will have to develop appropriate procedures for compliance with these consumer protection laws.

9
-

Card Networks
 
In order to provide our products and services, we, as well as the banks that issue our cards, must be registered with Visa and/or MasterCard, as well as any other networks that we desire to use, such as Discover, Pulse, NYCE and Star, and, as a result, are subject to card association rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card association or network for certain acts or omissions. The banks that issue our cards are specifically registered as "members" of the Visa and/or MasterCard card networks. Visa and MasterCard set the standards with which we and the card issuing banks must comply.
False Claims Laws and Other Fraud and Abuse Restrictions 
 
We provide claims processing and other transaction services to pharmaceutical companies that relate to, or directly involve, the reimbursement of pharmaceutical costs covered by Medicare, Medicaid, other federal healthcare programs and private payers. As a result of these aspects of our business, we may be subject to, or contractually required to comply with, state and federal laws that govern various aspects of the submission of healthcare claims for reimbursement and the receipt of payments for healthcare items or services. These laws generally prohibit an individual or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid or other third party payers that are false or fraudulent. False or fraudulent claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, failing to refund known overpayments, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, improper coding and billing for medically unnecessary goods and services. Many of these laws provide significant civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance and can be enforced by private individuals through “whistleblower” or qui tam actions. To avoid liability, providers and their contractors must, among other things, carefully and accurately code, complete and submit claims for reimbursement.
 
From time to time, constituents in the healthcare industry, including us, may be subject to actions under the federal False Claims Act or other fraud and abuse provisions. We cannot guarantee that state and federal agencies will regard any billing errors we process as inadvertent or will not hold us responsible for any compliance issues related to claims we handle on behalf of providers and payers. Although we believe our editing processes are consistent with applicable reimbursement rules and industry practice, a court, enforcement agency or whistleblower could challenge these practices. We cannot predict the impact of any enforcement actions under the various false claims and fraud and abuse laws applicable to our operations. Even an unsuccessful challenge of our practices could cause adverse publicity and cause us to incur significant legal and related costs.
 
Privacy and Security Standards under HIPAA or Other Laws.
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 contains privacy regulations and the security regulations that apply to some of our operations. The privacy regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by entities subject to HIPAA. For example, the privacy regulations permit parties to use and disclose individually identifiable health information for treatment and to process claims for payment, but other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the individual or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations. The privacy regulations also provide patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used and disclosed. To the extent permitted by the privacy regulations, ARRA and our contracts with our customers, we may use and disclose individually identifiable health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, such as creating de-identified information. Determining whether data has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the privacy regulations and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation. The security regulations require certain entities to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. We have implemented and maintain policies and processes to assist us in complying with the privacy regulations, the security regulations and our contractual obligations. We cannot provide assurance regarding how these standards will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations. If we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us, we could be subject to substantial penalties, damages and injunctive relief.
 



10
--

 

In addition to HIPAA, numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information and healthcare provider information. In addition, some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy and security of medical records or other types of medical information. In many cases, these state laws are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy regulations and may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities. Further, the U.S. Congress and a number of states have considered or are considering prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of medical or other information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secrets laws.
 
In order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information, all of our employees and consultants have signed confidentiality and we enter into nondisclosure agreements with third parties. We cannot provide assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights, however, will deter adequately infringement or misappropriation of those rights. Particularly given the international nature of the Internet, the rate of growth of the Internet and the ease of registering new domain names, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or take enforcement action.
Employees and Independent Contractors
 
As of March 1, 2019, we had sixty four employees and independent contractors.
 
We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and believe all independent contractor and employment agreements relationships are satisfactory. We hire independent contractors on an as-needed basis, and we may retain additional employees and consultants during the next twelve months, including additional executive management personnel with substantial experience in development business.
