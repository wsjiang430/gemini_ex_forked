Seasonality: Fluctuation of Results
 
Our revenues and results of operations can and usually are subject to seasonal variations. These variations are the result of weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons and holidays. The first quarter of the calendar year is typically the slowest in terms of revenues because inclement weather conditions causes delays in production and customers usually do not plan large projects during that time. While usually better than the first quarter, the second calendar year quarter often has some inclement weather which can cause delays in production, reducing the revenues the Company receives and/or increasing the production costs. The third and fourth calendar year quarters usually are less impacted by weather and usually have the largest number of projects underway. Many projects are completed in the fourth calendar year quarter and revenues are often impacted by customers seeking to either spend their capital budget for the year or scale back projects due to capital budget overruns.
 
In addition to the fluctuations discussed above, the pipeline industry can be highly cyclical, reflecting variances in capital expenditures in proportion to energy price fluctuations. As a result, our volume of business may be adversely affected by where our customers are in the cycle and thereby their financial condition as to their capital needs and access to capital to finance those needs.
 
Accordingly, our operating results in any quarter or year may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or any other year. You should read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Understanding Gross Margins” below for discussions of trends and challenges that may affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Financing Arrangements
 
On January 31, 2014, the Company entered into a financing arrangement (“Term Note”) with United Bank, Inc. (“United Bank”) and Summit Community Bank. The financing arrangement was a five-year term loan in the amount of $8.8 million. In addition, the Company entered into a separate five-year term loan agreement with First Guaranty Bank for $1.6 million, which was later refinanced by United Bank, Inc. Both loans were collateralized by the Company’s accounts receivable and equipment and were paid off during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019.
 
On December 16, 2014, the Company’s Nitro subsidiary entered into a 20-year $1.2 million loan agreement with First Bank of Charleston, Inc. (West Virginia) to purchase the office building and property it had previously been leasing for $6,300 monthly. The interest rate on this loan agreement is 4.82% with monthly payments of $7,800. The interest rate on this note is subject to change from time to time based on changes in The U.S. Treasury yield, adjusted to a constant maturity of three years as published by the Federal Reserve weekly. The loan is collateralized by the building purchased under this agreement. As of September 30, 2019, the Company has made principal payments of $189,000.
 
On September 16, 2015, the Company entered into a $2.5 million Non-Revolving Note agreement with United Bank. This six-year agreement gave the Company access to a $2.5 million line of credit (“Equipment Line of Credit”), specifically for the purchase of equipment, for the period of one year with an interest rate of 5.0%. After the first year, all borrowings against the Equipment Line of Credit were converted to a five-year term note agreement with an interest rate of 5.0%. The Company borrowed $2.5 million against this loan, which is collateralized by the equipment purchased under this agreement. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had made principal payments of $1.5 million. 
 
On November 13, 2015, the Company entered into a 10-year $1.1 million loan agreement with United Bank. to purchase the fabrication shop and property Nitro had previously been leasing for $12,900 each month. The interest rate on the loan agreement is 5.5% with monthly payments of $12,028. The loan is collateralized by the building and property purchased under this agreement. As of September 30, 2019, the Company has made principal payments of $348,000.

On June 28, 2017, the Company entered into a $5.0 million Non-Revolving Note agreement with United Bank. This five-year agreement gave the Company access to a $5.0 million line of credit (“Equipment Line of Credit 2017”), specifically for the purchase of equipment, for a period of three months with an interest rate of 4.99%. After three months, all borrowings against the Equipment Line of Credit 2017 were converted to a five-year term note agreement with an interest rate of 4.99%. The Company borrowed $5.0 million against this loan, which is collateralized by the equipment purchased under this agreement. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had made principal payments of $2.0 million.
 
On March 21, 2018, the Company entered into a financing agreement (“Operating Line of Credit (2018)”) with United Bank to provide the Company with a $15.0 million revolving line of credit. This line had a $12.5 million component and a $2.5 million component, each with separate borrowing requirements. Operating Line of Credit (2018) expired on February 28, 2019 but was extended through April 28, 2019. The Company received a twelve-month extension (“Operating Line of Credit (2019)”) through April 28, 2020 on May 7, 2019. Based on covenant ratios, the Company qualifies for the first $12.5 million component but not the $2.5 million component. Based on the borrowing base calculation, the Company could borrow up to $11.5 million as of September 30, 2019. The Company had borrowed $3.5 million on the line of credit, leaving $8.0 million available on the line of credit. Please see page 19 for a description of the $12.5 million and $2.5 million components and the borrowing base calculation.
 
On May 30, 2019, the Company entered into a financing agreement (“Term Note (2019)”) with United Bank which refinanced the $10.0 million borrowed on Operating Line of Credit (2019) to a five-year term note with a fixed interest rate of 5.50%. The purpose of this note was to finance a specific construction project completed in September 2019. The Company anticipates paying off Term Note (2019) in less than one year. Covenants for the loan are the same as the $12.5 million component of Operating Line of Credit (2019). The loan is collateralized by the Company’s equipment. The refinancing effectively reset the Company’s line of credit borrowings to zero as of May 30, 2019 and did not affect the conditions of subsequent borrowings. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had made principal payments of $2.1 million.
 
Backlog/New Business
 
The Company’s backlog represents contracts for services that have been entered into, but which have not yet been completed. At September 30, 2019, Energy Services had a backlog of $63.0 million of work to be completed on existing contracts. At September 30, 2018, the Company had a backlog of $71.1 million. Due to the timing of Energy Services’ construction contracts and the long-term nature of some of our projects, portions of our backlog work may not be completed in the current fiscal year. Most of the Company’s projects can be completed in a short period of time, typically two to five months. Larger projects usually take seven to eighteen months to be completed. As a rule, work starts shortly after the signing of the contract.
 
Types of Contracts
 
Energy Services’ contracts are usually awarded on a competitive and negotiated basis. While some contracts may be lump sum or time and material projects, most of the work is bid based upon unit prices for various portions of the work with a total agreed-upon price based on estimated units. The actual revenues produced from the project will be dependent upon how accurate the customer estimates are as to the units of the various items.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
The principal raw materials that the Company and its subsidiaries use are metal plate, structural steel, pipe, wire, fittings and selected engineering equipment such as pumps, valves and compressors. For the most part, the largest portion of these materials are supplied by the customer. The materials that the Company purchases are predominately those of a consumable nature on the job, such as small tools and environmental supplies. We anticipate being able to obtain these materials, as well as any raw materials not supplied by our customers, for the foreseeable future.

Industry Factors
 
Energy Services’ revenues, cash flows and earnings are substantially dependent upon, and affected by, the level of natural gas exploration development activity and the levels of work on existing pipelines as well as the level of demand for our electrical and mechanical services. Such activity and the resulting level of demand for pipeline construction and related services and electrical and mechanical services are directly influenced by many factors over which the Company has no control. Such factors include the market prices of natural gas and electricity, market expectations about future prices, the volatility of such prices, the cost of producing and delivering natural gas and electricity, government regulations and trade restrictions, local and international political and economic conditions, the development of alternate energy sources, changes in the tax code that affect the energy industry, and the long-term effects of worldwide energy conservation measures. Energy Services cannot predict the future level of demand for its construction services, future conditions in the pipeline or electrical construction industry or future pipeline and electrical construction rates.
Competition
 
The pipeline construction industry is a highly competitive business characterized by high capital and maintenance costs. Pipeline contracts are usually awarded through a competitive bid process. The Company believes that operators consider factors such as quality of service, type and location of equipment, or the ability to provide ancillary services. However, price and the ability to complete the project in a timely manner are the primary factors in determining which contractor is awarded a job. There are many regional and national competitors that offer services similar to Energy Services. Certain of the Company’s competitors have greater financial and human resources than Energy Services, which may enable them to compete more efficiently because of price and technology. The Company’s largest competitors are Otis Eastern, Miller Pipeline, Brown Electric, Summit Electric and Apex Pipeline.
Operating Hazards and Insurance
 
Energy Services’ operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the pipeline construction business, including, for example, operating equipment in mountainous terrain, people working in deep trenches and people working near large equipment. These hazards could cause personal injury or death, serious damage to or destruction of property and equipment, suspension of drilling operations, or substantial damage to the environment, including damage to producing formations and surrounding areas. Energy Services seeks protection against certain of these risks through insurance, including property casualty insurance on its equipment, commercial general liability and commercial contract indemnity, commercial umbrella and workers’ compensation insurance.
 
The Company’s insurance coverage for property damage to its equipment is based on estimates of the cost of comparable used equipment to replace the insured property. There is a deductible per occurrence on equipment of $2,500 and $500 for damage to miscellaneous tools. The Company also maintains third party liability insurance, pollution and professional liability insurance, and a commercial umbrella policy. Energy Services believes that it is adequately insured for public liability and property damage to others with respect to its operations. However, such insurance may not be enough to protect Energy Services against liability for all consequences related to its operations.
 
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
 
General. Energy Services’ operations are affected from time to time in varying degrees by political developments and federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, natural gas production, operations and the profitability of the gas industry are or have been affected by price controls, taxes and other laws relating to the natural gas industry, by changes in such laws and by changes in administrative regulations. Although significant capital expenditures may be required to comply with such laws and regulations, to date, such compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on the earnings or competitive position of Energy Services. In addition, Energy Services’ operations are vulnerable to risks arising from the numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Energy Services may also be affected by regulations designed to provide benefits to companies engaged in the production of alternative sources of energy, such as solar, wind, and related industries.

Environmental Regulation. Energy Services’ activities are subject to existing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality, pollution control and the preservation of natural resources. Such laws and regulations concern, among other things, the containment, disposal and recycling of waste materials, and reporting of the storage, use or release of certain chemicals or hazardous substances. Numerous federal and state environmental laws regulate drilling activities and impose liability for discharges of waste or spills, including those in coastal areas. The Company has conducted pipeline construction in or near ecologically sensitive areas, such as wetlands and coastal environments, which are subject to additional regulatory requirements. State and federal legislation also provide special protections to animal and marine life that could be affected by the Company’s activities. In general, under various applicable environmental programs, the Company may potentially be subject to regulatory enforcement action in the form of injunctions, cease and desist orders and administrative, civil and criminal penalties for violations of environmental laws. Energy Services may also be subject to liability for natural resource damages and other civil claims arising out of a pollution event. The Company would be responsible for any pollution event that was determined to be caused by its actions. It has insurance that it believes is adequate to cover any such occurrences.
 
Environmental regulations that affect Energy Services’ customers also have an indirect impact on Energy Services. Increasingly stringent environmental regulation of the natural gas industry has led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthier well permitting process.
 
The primary environmental statutory and regulatory programs that affect Energy Services’ operations include the following: Department of Transportation regulations, regulations set forth by agencies such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and various environmental agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local government agencies.
 
Health and Safety Matters. Energy Services’ facilities and operations are also governed by various other laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, relating to worker health and workplace safety. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued the Hazard Communication Standard. This standard applies to all private-sector employers, including the natural gas exploration and producing industry. The Hazard Communication Standard requires that employers assess their chemical hazards, obtain and maintain certain written descriptions of these hazards, develop a hazard communication program and train employees to work safely with the chemicals on site. Failure to comply with the requirements of the standard may result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Energy Services believes that appropriate precautions are taken to protect employees and others from harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at its facilities and that it operates in substantial compliance with all Occupational Safety and Health Act regulations. It is not anticipated that Energy Services will be required to make material expenditures by reason of such health and safety laws and regulations.
 
Research and Development/Intellectual Property
 
Energy Services has not made any material expenditure for research and development. Energy Services does not own any patents, trademarks or licenses.
 
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2019, the Company had approximately 484 employees including management, with approximately 85 of those employees being full-time. The Company’s construction personnel are trade union members represented by various collective bargaining units.
