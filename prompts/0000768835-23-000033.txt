Item 1. Business
The Company
Big Lots, Inc., an Ohio corporation, through its wholly owned subsidiaries is a home discount retailer operating in the United States (“U.S.”). At January 28, 2023, we operated a total of 1,425 stores and an e-commerce platform. Our mission is to help people Live BIG and Save LOTS. Our vision is to be the BIG difference for a better life by delivering unmistakable value to customers, building a “best places to grow” culture, rewarding shareholders with top tier growth and returns, and doing good in local communities.
Our principal executive offices are located at 4900 E. Dublin-Granville Road, Columbus, Ohio 43081, and our telephone number is (614) 278‑6800.
Unless this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) otherwise indicates or the context otherwise requires, the terms the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Big Lots, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Similar to many other retailers, our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which results in some fiscal years consisting of 52 weeks and some fiscal years consisting of 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this Form 10-K relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years. The following table summarizes our fiscal year calendar and the number of weeks in each fiscal year:

Fiscal Year | Number of Weeks | Year Begin Date | Year End Date 
2023 | 53 | January 29, 2023 | February 3, 2024
2022 | 52 | January 30, 2022 | January 28, 2023
2021 | 52 | January 31, 2021 | January 29, 2022
2020 | 52 | February 2, 2020 | January 30, 2021
2019 | 52 | February 3, 2019 | February 1, 2020
2018 | 52 | February 4, 2018 | February 2, 2019

We manage our business on the basis of one segment: discount retailing. We use the following seven merchandise categories, which are consistent with our internal management and reporting of merchandise net sales: Food; Consumables; Soft Home; Hard Home; Furniture; Seasonal; and Apparel, Electronics, & Other. The Food category includes our beverage & grocery; specialty foods; and pet departments. The Consumables category includes our health, beauty and cosmetics; plastics; paper; and chemical departments. The Soft Home category includes our home décor; frames; fashion bedding; utility bedding; bath; window; decorative textile; and area rugs departments. The Hard Home category includes our small appliances; table top; food preparation; stationery; home maintenance; home organization; and toys departments. The Furniture category includes our upholstery; mattress; ready-to-assemble; and case goods departments. The Seasonal category includes our lawn & garden; summer; Christmas; and other holiday departments. The Apparel, Electronics, & Other department includes our apparel; electronics; jewelry; hosiery; and candy & snacks departments, as well as the assortments for The Lot, our cross-category presentation solution, and the Queue Line, our streamlined checkout experience.
We periodically assess, and make minor adjustments to, our product hierarchy, which can impact the roll-up of our merchandise categories. Our financial reporting process utilizes the most current product hierarchy in reporting net sales by merchandise category for all periods presented. Therefore, there may be minor reclassifications of net sales by merchandise category compared to previously reported amounts.

Merchandising
We focus our merchandising strategy on (1) the bargain hunt, by seeking to deliver unmatched value in all of our merchandise categories through high quality closeouts on name brand items, affordable opening price points and low prices on our own brand assortment; (2) the treasure hunt, by seeking to surprise and delight our customers with a fresh, unique, quirky, trendy and seasonal product assortment; and (3) essentials, by seeking to offer a reliable assortment of simple to shop staple products that bring consistency to our product mix. We evaluate our product offerings to ensure we are providing high quality and unmistakable value, and meeting our customer’s expectations. We believe that focusing on our customers’ expectations has improved our ability to provide a more relevant and desirable assortment of offerings in our merchandise categories. 
We utilize traditional sourcing methods in purchasing both imported and domestic products. In certain merchandise categories, we also take advantage of closeout channels to enhance our ability to offer products that provide unmistakable value and surprise and delight our customers. We generally source closeouts from production overruns, packaging changes, discontinued products, order cancellations, liquidations, returns, and other disruptions in the supply chains of manufacturers, but also from engineered closeouts and other sourcing options. We have increased our sourcing and purchasing of high quality closeout merchandise directly from manufacturers and other vendors, typically at prices lower than those paid by traditional discount retailers, to accelerate our ability to deliver unmistakable value. We believe our strong vendor relationships support this sourcing model, and we intend to continue to grow our bargain and treasure merchandise offerings during 2023. 
Our global sourcing team and overseas vendor relationships continue to represent important components of our merchandising strategy. We expect our import partners to responsibly source goods that our merchandising teams identify as having our desired mix of quality and value. During 2022, we purchased approximately 28% of our merchandise, at cost, directly from overseas vendors, including approximately 19% from vendors located in China. Additionally, a significant amount of our domestically-purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad. As a result, a significant portion of our merchandise supply is subject to certain risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.
Advertising and Marketing
We believe that our brand image is an important part of why our customers choose to shop Big Lots. We also believe our brand image is important to the value proposition that we convey through all of our customer touchpoints. We employ an integrated approach for our marketing touchpoints and investments consisting of: (1) paid media, including television, print, digital, social media, internet, e-mail, and payment card-linked marketing; (2) earned media, including public relations and organic social media; and (3) owned media, including our website, customer loyalty programs, and in-store signage. Total advertising expense as a percentage of total net sales was 1.8%, 1.6%, and 1.7% in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
We have conducted extensive consumer research to enhance our understanding of why customers shop us and the reasons why others do not shop us. We have used this research to refine our brand positioning and implement changes to our messaging across all marketing touchpoints. Our research shows that our customers believe we excel in four key areas or brand pillars: unmistakable value, surprising products, easy shopping, and a delightful experience. Accordingly, our marketing strategy is grounded in these brand pillars. Our marketing tactics are intended to: (1) create a community of bargain hunters and treasure seekers; (2) drive incremental visits from new and existing customers; (3) increase our brand awareness, brand consideration and purchasers; and (4) drive personalized marketing based on our customer data platform. Our consumer research also influences how we merchandise our stores, invest in omnichannel capabilities, design our shopping experience, and invest in our business.
Our customer data is an important marketing tool that allows us to communicate with our customers in a cost-effective, personalized, and relevant manner, including through e-mail delivery of our circulars, announcement of flash sales, and product-specific promotions. At January 28, 2023, our customer loyalty program, which we call the “BIG Rewards Program,” included approximately 21 million active members who had made a purchase in our stores in the last 12 months, compared to approximately 22 million active members at January 29, 2022. In addition to the customer communications mentioned above, our BIG Rewards Program rewards our customers for making frequent and high-ticket purchases and offers a special birthday reward. We utilize insights gained through the BIG Rewards Program to evaluate the effectiveness of our promotions, tailor promotions to our customers’ shopping habits, and gain consumer insights. Our research shows that membership in the BIG Rewards Program is a driver of net sales, and we have incentivized our store associates to encourage customer enrollment into the program.

We believe our approach to retailing differentiates us from the competition and allows us to make a difference in the communities we serve. Our community-oriented approach to retailing includes “doing good as we do well,” which means supporting both local and national causes that aid the communities in which we do business. We invest in point of sale campaigns in each of our geographic regions, the beneficiaries of which are selected based on their impacts on local customers and associates. We serve the community on a national level through our Big Lots Foundation, which focuses on healthcare, housing, hunger, and education. In addition, we are pleased to support our local community in Columbus, OH through our partnership with Nationwide Children’s Hospital, to which the Company committed $40 million and the Big Lots Foundation committed $10 million to the Big Lots Behavioral Health Pavilion, a state-of-the-art medical facility dedicated to child and adolescent mental and behavioral health, which opened in 2020.
Competition
We operate in the highly competitive retail industry. We face strong sales competition from other general merchandise, discount, home, food, furniture, arts and crafts, and dollar store retailers, which operate in traditional brick and mortar stores and/or online. Additionally, we compete with a number of companies for retail site locations and, distribution site locations, to attract and retain quality employees, and to acquire our broad merchandising assortment from vendors. We operate an e-commerce platform which faces additional competition for customer, fulfillment capabilities, and technological innovation from a wider range of retailers in a highly competitive marketplace.

Louisiana | 20 | North Dakota | 1 | | | Wyoming | 2 
 | | | | Total stores | 1,425 | 
 | | | | Number of states | 48 

Of our 1,425 stores, 31% operate in four states: California, Texas, Florida, and Ohio, and net sales from stores in these states represented 33% of our 2022 net sales. We have a concentration in these states based on their size, population, and customer base.
Warehouse and Distribution
While certain of our merchandise vendors deliver directly to our stores, the large majority of our inventory is staged and delivered from our distribution centers to facilitate prompt and efficient distribution and transportation of merchandise to our stores and help maximize our sales and inventory turnover.
The majority of our merchandise offerings are processed for retail sale and distributed to our stores from five regional distribution centers located in Alabama, California, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania. 
We selected the locations of our regional distribution centers to help manage transportation costs and to minimize the distance from our distribution centers to our stores. 
In addition to our regional distribution centers that handle store merchandise, we operate two other warehouses within our Ohio distribution center. One warehouse distributes fixtures and supplies to our stores and our five regional distribution centers and the other warehouse serves as a fulfillment center for our direct-ship e-commerce operations. To supplement our e-commerce fulfillment center, we also fulfill direct-ship e-commerce orders from 65 of our store locations, which we strategically selected based on geographic location, size, and other relevant factors. We also fulfill some of our e-commerce orders using supplier direct fulfillment, a process in which the customer purchases merchandise through our e-commerce platform, but the merchandise is shipped directly from the supplier to the customer. Supplier direct fulfillment is primarily used for bulky items that are more costly to warehouse and ship. We continue to evaluate our e-commerce fulfillment capabilities to reduce shipping times. 
In 2021, we opened two small-format forward distribution centers located in Georgia and Pennsylvania, to divert processing and logistics for bulk goods out of our regional distribution centers into our forward distribution centers and, increase the efficiency and capacity of our regional distribution centers, which were designed to efficiently process cartons as opposed to bulk goods. In 2022, we opened two additional small-format forward distribution centers in Washington and Indiana, to accommodate projected purchasing volumes. Each of our four forward distribution centers are operated by a third-party logistics services provider. In March 2023, the Company communicated to our third-party logistics service provider our plans to close all of our forward distribution centers by August 2023 due to the decreases in sales and purchasing volumes. We will

continue to evaluate our supply chain needs based on projected purchasing volumes and adjust the capacity of our distribution and fulfillment network accordingly.
For additional information regarding our warehouses and distribution facilities and related initiatives, see the discussion under the caption “Warehouse and Distribution” in “Item 2. Properties” of this Form 10-K.
Seasonality
We have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability, with a larger percentage of our net sales and operating profit realized in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the Christmas holiday selling season. Our quarterly net sales and operating profits can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings, advertising, and certain holidays. We historically receive a higher proportion of merchandise, carry higher inventory levels, and incur higher outbound shipping and payroll expenses as a percentage of sales in our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during our fourth fiscal quarter. Performance during our fourth fiscal quarter typically reflects a leveraging effect which has a favorable impact on our operating results because net sales are higher and certain of our costs, such as rent and depreciation, are fixed and do not vary as sales levels escalate. If our sales performance is significantly better or worse during the Christmas holiday selling season, we would expect a more pronounced impact on our annual financial results than if our sales performance is significantly better or worse in a different season.
Our net sales in the second quarter of 2020 as a percentage of full year were disproportionately higher as a result of increased demand arising from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government stimulus payments. Similarly, our net sales in the first quarter of 2021 as a percentage of full year were disproportionately higher as demand increased due to government stimulus payments related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The seasonality of our net sales in 2022 generally aligned with our historical seasonality. The seasonality of our operating results, however, differs significantly due to our recording an operating loss in each quarter of 2022 compared to recording an operating loss in only one quarter (the third quarter of 2021) in the prior two years. This change in the seasonality of our operating results is primarily attributable to inflationary and macroeconomic pressures experienced throughout 2022, which resulted in decreased net sales, decreased gross margin as a percentage of net sales, and increased selling and administrative expenses. 
The following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit (loss) for 2022, 2021, and 2020 by fiscal quarter:

 | First | Second | Third | Fourth
Fiscal Year 2022 | | | | 
Net sales as a percentage of full year | 25.1 | % | 24.6 | % | 22.0 | % | 28.3 | %
Operating loss as a percentage of full year (a) | (5.2) | | (41.7) | | (50.0) | | (3.1) | 
Fiscal Year 2021 | | | | 
Net sales as a percentage of full year | 26.4 | % | 23.7 | % | 21.7 | % | 28.2 | %
Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of full year | 51.1 | | 22.5 | | (1.7) | | 28.1 | 
Fiscal Year 2020 | | | | 
Net sales as a percentage of full year | 23.2 | % | 26.5 | % | 22.2 | % | 28.1 | %
Operating profit as a percentage of full year (b) | 8.7 | | 71.0 | | 5.0 | | 15.3 | 

(a) The second, third, and fourth quarters of 2022 included asset impairment charges of $24.1 million, $21.7 million, and $22.6 million, respectively. The fourth quarter of 2022 also included a gain on sale of real estate and related expenses of $16.8 million related to the sale of 20 owned store locations and one unoccupied land parcel. 
(b) The second quarter of 2020 included a gain on sale of distribution centers and related expenses of $459.1 million related to the sale and leaseback of four distribution centers.

Human Capital
At January 28, 2023, we had approximately 32,200 active associates comprised of 10,200 full-time and 22,000 part‑time associates. Approximately 68% of the associates we employed during 2022 were employed on a part-time basis. Temporary associates hired for the holiday selling season increased the total number of associates to a peak of approximately 35,800 in 2022. We are not a party to any labor agreements. We require all of our associates to adhere to our code of ethics and workplace safety protocols.
We believe our associates are among our most important resources. We evaluate our human capital management at our stores, distribution centers, and corporate headquarters on the basis of associate engagement, diversity, equity, and inclusion, compensation and benefits, talent development and health and safety.
Associate Engagement
We have sent an associate engagement survey to each of the associates in our corporate headquarters and to our field and distribution center leadership on an annual basis to assess our associate engagement and obtain the thoughts of those associates regarding manager effectiveness, performance enablement, and our diversity and inclusion efforts. In 2022, 89% of the associates surveyed responded to the survey with a 77% favorable engagement rate. Based on results of the annual survey, our leaders create action plans to address areas where our associates have told us we can improve. As a structural expense savings measure, we intend to perform future associate engagement surveys on a less frequent basis.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We recognize the value of creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. As a result, diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) is a significant component of our human capital management. As part of our commitment to DEI, we maintain a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council (“DEI Council”), which is comprised of associates from our stores, distribution centers, and corporate headquarters who represent various job levels, locations, ages, genders, languages, work shifts, races, sexual orientations, and leadership styles, was established in 2020 to lead the development and advancement of our DEI strategy. Additionally, our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Executive Advisory Committee, which is comprised of senior leaders, provides guidance to the DEI Council, approves our DEI strategy and promotes its achievement throughout our organization. In 2022, we integrated our conscious inclusion program into the onboarding process for all of our associates, which we developed to build awareness of our DEI strategy, educate our associates on how we can improve DEI, and ultimately engrain DEI in the culture of the Company. 
Compensation and Benefits
We offer a competitive compensation and benefits package to our eligible associates including, among other benefits, incentive compensation, performance-based merit pay, paid holidays, paid vacation, 401(k) match, and healthcare coverage, including medical, dental, and vision insurance with health savings account and flexible savings account options. Our compensation and benefits packages are designed to attract and retain high-performing talent. Additionally, we provide our associates with a company discount on our merchandise and our associates redeemed over $25 million in corporate discounts in 2022.
Talent Development
Talent development is critical to developing the high-performance culture that we seek to foster. Each of our associates participates in an annual goal-setting process and completes an annual performance review, which is followed by periodic discussions throughout the year to assess progress. Each of our managers also completes an individual development plan on an annual basis to set and track long-term goals. Additionally, our business leaders participate in a succession planning process that serves as a tool for identifying and developing high-potential individuals within our organization as well as ensuring business continuity. We also offer a robust catalog of training and development programs to our associates through our Big Lots University training tool, which covers topics including, but not limited to, workplace harassment, safety, ethics, leadership, and job skills.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our associates is of the utmost importance. We have implemented comprehensive safety protocols in each of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices to ensure the safety of associates, customers, and other visitors in each facility. We require each of our associates to complete safety training courses relevant to their jobs, which we track using e-learning tools to ensure compliance. In addition to traditional safety training, we require all of our associates to participate in aggressor/active shooter training and we require our store associates to participate in argumentative and de-escalating conversations training. We reinforce safety standards with re-training requirements and regular, engaging communications.
