ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General 
Unum Group, a Delaware general business corporation, and its insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries, which collectively with Unum Group we refer to as the Company, operate in the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, and, to a limited extent, in certain other countries. The principal operating subsidiaries in the United States are Unum Life Insurance Company of America (Unum America), Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company (Provident), The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company (Paul Revere Life), Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company, Starmount Life Insurance Company (Starmount Life), in the United Kingdom, Unum Limited, and in Poland, Unum Zycie TUiR S.A. (Unum Poland). We are a leading provider of financial protection benefits in the United States and the United Kingdom. Our products include disability, life, accident, critical illness, dental and vision, and other related services. We market our products primarily through the workplace. 
We have three principal operating business segments: Unum US, Unum International, and Colonial Life. Our other segments are the Closed Block and Corporate segments. These segments are discussed more fully under "Reporting Segments" included herein in this Item 1. 
Business Strategies
The benefits we provide help protect people from the financial hardship of illness, injury, or loss of life by providing support when it is needed most. As one of the leading providers of employee benefits in the U.S. and the U.K., we offer a broad portfolio of products and services through the workplace. 
Specifically, we offer group, individual, and voluntary benefits, either as stand-alone products or combined with other coverages, that help employers of all sizes attract and retain a stronger workforce while protecting the incomes and livelihood of their employees. We believe employer-sponsored benefits represent the single most effective way to provide workers with access to the information and options they need to protect their financial stability. Working people and their families, particularly those at lower and middle incomes, are perhaps the most vulnerable in today's economy yet are often overlooked by many providers of financial services and products. For many of these people, employer-sponsored benefits are the primary defense against the potentially catastrophic fallout of death, illness, or injury. 

We have established a corporate culture consistent with the social values our products provide. We are committed not only to meeting the needs of our customers who depend on us, but also to operating with integrity and being accountable for our actions. Our sound and consistent business practices, strong internal compliance program, and comprehensive risk management strategy enable us to operate efficiently as well as to identify and address potential areas of risk in our business. We have also applied these same values to our social responsibility efforts. Because we see important links between the obligations we have to all of our stakeholders, we place a strong emphasis on contributing to positive change in our communities.

We believe our disciplined approach to providing financial protection products at the workplace puts us in a position of strength as we seek to capitalize on the growing and largely unfilled need for our products and services. We protect people when they need it most, and we believe the need for our products and services remains strong. We intend to continue protecting our solid margins and returns through our pricing and risk actions. We also continue to invest in our infrastructure and our employees, with a focus on quality and simplification of processes and offerings. Our strategy is centered on market growth through the expansion of our product portfolio, distribution system, and geographic footprint, and enhancing the customer experience through efficiency, simplification, and investment in digital capabilities. Accordingly, we continue to identify ways to expand our product offerings, which we believe will allow us to strengthen our brand through both new and existing customer relationships. Although the low interest rate environment continues to place pressure on our profit margins, we continue to analyze and employ strategies that we believe will help us navigate this environment and allow us to maintain solid operating margins and significant financial flexibility to support the needs of our businesses, while also continuing to return capital to our shareholders and exploring merger and acquisition opportunities to enhance our business lines. We have substantial leverage to rising interest rates and an improving economy which generates payroll growth and wage inflation. We believe that consistent operating results, combined with the implementation of strategic initiatives and the effective deployment of capital, will allow us to meet our long-term financial objectives.

Reporting Segments 
Our reporting segments are comprised of the following: Unum US, Unum International, Colonial Life, Closed Block, and Corporate. In connection with our acquisition of Unum Poland in the fourth quarter of 2018, we changed the name of our Unum UK segment to Unum International. The Unum International segment is comprised of our Unum UK line of business and our Unum Poland line of business. The percentage of consolidated premium income generated by each reporting segment for the year ended December 31, 2018 is as follows:

Unum US | 63.8 | %
Unum International | 6.3 | 
Colonial Life | 17.9 | 
Closed Block | 12.0 | 
Total | 100.0 | %

Financial information, including discussion of the acquisition of Unum Poland, is provided in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7 and Note 13 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.
Unum US Segment
Our Unum US segment includes group long-term and short-term disability insurance, group life and accidental death and dismemberment products, and supplemental and voluntary lines of business. The supplemental and voluntary lines of business are comprised of individual disability, voluntary benefits, and dental and vision products. Unum US products are issued primarily by Unum America, Provident, and Starmount Life. Paul Revere Life previously issued products reported in our Unum US segment and continues to service the in-force policies, but Paul Revere Life no longer actively markets new business. These products are marketed through our field sales personnel who work in conjunction with independent brokers and consultants. Our market strategy for Unum US is to effectively deliver an integrated offering of employee benefit products in the group core market segment, which we define for Unum US as employee groups with fewer than 2,000 employees, the group large case market segment, and the supplemental and voluntary market segment.
The percentage of Unum US segment premium income generated by each product line during 2018 is as follows:

Group Disability | 43.1 | %
Group Life and Accidental Death & Dismemberment | 30.3 | 
Individual Disability | 7.4 | 
Voluntary Benefits | 15.6 | 
Dental and Vision | 3.6 | 
Total | 100.0 | %

Group Long-term and Short-term Disability
We sell group long-term and short-term disability products to employers for the benefit of employees. Group long-term disability provides employees with insurance coverage for loss of income in the event of extended work absences due to sickness or injury. We offer services to employers and insureds to encourage and facilitate rehabilitation, retraining, and re-employment. Most policies begin providing benefits following 90 or 180 day waiting periods and continue providing benefits until the employee reaches a certain age, generally between 65 and 70, or recovers from the disability. The benefits are limited to specified maximums as a percentage of income. Effective January 1, 2018, coverage began for our new medical stop-loss product, which is included in our group long-term disability product line. Medical stop-loss is designed to protect self-insured employers if their employees' medical claims exceed certain agreed upon thresholds.
Group short-term disability insurance generally provides coverage from loss of income due to injury or sickness, effective immediately for accidents and after one week for sickness, for up to 26 weeks, limited to specified maximums as a percentage of income. 
Premiums for group long-term and short-term disability are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. In some cases, coverage for large employers will 
 3

include retrospective experience rating provisions or will be underwritten on an experience-rated basis. Premiums for experience-rated group long-term and short-term disability business are based on the expected experience of the client given its demographics, industry group, and location, adjusted for the credibility of the specific claim experience of the client. Both group long-term and short-term disability are sold primarily on a basis permitting periodic repricing to address the underlying claims experience. We also offer fee-based administrative services only (ASO) products, where the responsibility for funding claim payments remains with the customer, and fee-based family medical leave products. Premiums for our medical stop-loss product are generally based on the number of covered employees in self-insured employer groups and their estimated overall health risk plus provisions for administrative expenses, and profit. 
We have defined underwriting practices and procedures. If the coverage amount exceeds certain prescribed age and amount limits, we may require a prospective insured to submit evidence of insurability. Our disability policies are typically issued, both at inception and renewal, with rate guarantees. For new group policyholders, the usual rate guarantee is one to three years. For group policies being renewed, the rate guarantee is generally one year, but may be longer. The profitability of the policy depends on the adequacy of the rate during the rate guarantee period. The contracts provide for certain circumstances in which the rate guarantees can be overridden. Our medical stop loss contracts are typically renewable on an annual basis and rates are not guaranteed beyond one year. There is no requirement for prospective insureds to submit evidence of insurability because coverage levels are determined for the group as a whole.
Profitability of group long-term and short-term disability insurance and our medical stop-loss product is affected by sales, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses. Morbidity is an important factor in disability claims experience, and many economic and societal factors can affect claim incidence for disability insurance. We routinely make pricing adjustments on our group insurance products, when contractually permitted, which take into account emerging experience and external factors. 
Group Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment

Group life and accidental death and dismemberment products are sold to employers as employee benefit products. Group life consists primarily of renewable term life insurance with the coverages frequently linked to employees' wages and includes a provision for waiver of premium, if disabled. Accidental death and dismemberment consists primarily of an additional benefit amount payable if death or severe injury is attributable to an accident. 
Premiums are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Underwriting practices and rate guarantees are similar to those used for group disability products, and evidence of insurability is required for benefits in excess of a specified limit. 
Profitability of group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.
Individual Disability
Individual disability products are offered primarily to multi-life employer groups to supplement their group disability plans and may be funded by the employer, but the policy is owned by the employee and is portable. Individual disability insurance provides the insured with a portion of earned income lost as a result of sickness or injury. The benefits, including the underlying group disability coverage, typically range from 30 percent to 75 percent of the insured's monthly earned income. We provide various options with respect to length of benefit periods, product features, and waiting periods before benefit payments begin, which permit tailoring of the multi-life plan to a specific employer's needs. We also market individual disability policies which include payments for the transfer of business ownership between partners and payments for business overhead expenses, also on a multi-life basis. Individual disability products do not provide for the accumulation of cash values. 
Premium rates for individual disability products vary by age, product features, and occupation based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own experience. Our underwriting rules, issue limits, and plan designs reflect risk and the financial circumstances of prospective insureds. Individuals in multi-life groups may be subject to limited medical underwriting. The majority of our individual disability policies are written on a noncancelable basis. Under a noncancelable policy, as long as the insured continues to pay the fixed annual premium for the policy's duration, we cannot cancel the policy or change the premium.

Voluntary Benefits
Voluntary benefits products are primarily sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction at the workplace and include life, disability, accident, hospital indemnity, cancer, and critical illness offered on both a group and individual basis. 
Premium rates for voluntary benefits products are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables. Our underwriters evaluate the medical condition of prospective policyholders prior to the issuance of a policy on a simplified basis. Underwriting requirements may be waived for cases that meet certain criteria, including participation levels. Individual voluntary benefits products other than life insurance are offered on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies, subject to regulatory approval. Group voluntary benefits products are offered primarily on an optionally renewable basis which allows us to re-price or terminate in-force policies. 
Profitability of voluntary benefits products is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.
Dental and Vision
Group dental and vision products are sold to employers as employee benefit products. Our group dental products include a variety of insured and self-insured dental care plans including preferred provider organizations and scheduled reimbursement plans. Our group vision products provide coverage that includes a range of both in-network and out-of-network benefits for routine vision services offered either in conjunction with our dental product offerings or as stand-alone coverage.
Premiums for small case group dental and vision products are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus a provision for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Premiums for large employer groups are underwritten on an experience-rated basis.
Profitability of our dental and vision products is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.
We discontinued offering our direct-to-consumer individual dental and vision products, a portion of the Starmount Life offering, in the second half of 2018 to focus on the integration of our dental and vision products in our existing Unum US and Colonial Life distribution channels. 
Unum International Segment
The Unum International segment includes our operations in the United Kingdom and Poland. Unum UK's business includes insurance for group long-term disability, group life, and supplemental lines of business which include dental, individual disability, and critical illness products. Unum Poland's business primarily includes insurance for individual and group life with accident and health riders. Both Unum UK's and Unum Poland's products are sold primarily through field sales personnel and independent brokers and consultants. Unum Poland 's results are included within the supplemental product. The market strategy for the segment is to offer benefits to employers and employees through the workplace, with a focus on the expansion of the number of employers and employees covered in our Unum UK core market segment, which we define as employee groups with fewer than 500 employees, and the growth of the existing Unum Poland business through the incorporation of our benefits and distribution expertise.
The percentage of Unum International segment premium income generated by each product line during 2018 is as follows:

Group Long-term Disability | 63.1 | %
Group Life | 19.5 | 
Supplemental | 17.4 | 
Total | 100.0 | %

Group Life
Group life products are sold to employers as employee benefit products. Group life consists of two types of products, a renewable term life insurance product and a group dependent life product. The renewable term life product provides a lump sum benefit to the beneficiary on death of an employee. The group dependent life product, which we discontinued offering to new customers in 2012, provides an annuity to the beneficiary upon the death of an employee. Both coverages are frequently linked to employees' wages. Premiums for group life are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Underwriting and rate guarantees are similar to those utilized for group long-term disability products. 
Profitability of group life is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.    
Supplemental
Supplemental products for our Unum UK line of business are sold to individual retail customers as well as groups of employees and include individual disability, group and individual critical illness, and group dental. Individual disability products provide the insured with a portion of earned income lost as a result of sickness or injury. Critical illness products provide a lump-sum benefit on the occurrence of a covered critical illness event. Group dental products generally provide fixed benefits based on specified treatments or a portion of the cost of the treatment. Unum Poland products, which include both individual and group life products, provide renewable term and whole life insurance with accident and health riders.
Premiums for our individual products vary by age and are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables. Approximately one half of our individual disability policies are written on a noncancelable basis. The remainder of our individual disability policies and all of our individual critical illness products are offered on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies. Our underwriters evaluate the medical and financial condition of prospective policyholders prior to the issuance of a policy. 
Premiums for group critical illness products are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Underwriting and rate guarantees are similar to those utilized for group long-term disability products. Premiums for group dental products are generally based on standard industry rates that vary by age, with minor pricing variation based on the number of covered employees in the group.

Colonial Life Segment 
Our Colonial Life segment includes insurance for accident, sickness, and disability products, which includes our expanded dental and vision products, life products, and cancer and critical illness products issued primarily by Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company and marketed to employees, on both a group and an individual basis, at the workplace through an independent contractor agency sales force and brokers. Our market strategy for Colonial Life is to effectively deliver a broad set of voluntary products and services in the public sector market and in the commercial market, with a particular focus on the core commercial market segment, which we define for Colonial Life as accounts with fewer than 1,000 employees.
We have defined underwriting practices and procedures for each of our products. Most policies are issued on a simplified issue basis, based on answers to simple health and employment questions. If the amount applied for exceeds certain levels, the applicant may be asked to answer additional health questions or submit to additional medical examinations.
The percentage of Colonial Life segment premium income generated by each product line during 2018 is as follows:

Accident, Sickness, and Disability | 57.9 | %
Life | 20.5 | 
Cancer and Critical Illness | 21.6 | 
Total | 100.0 | %

Accident, Sickness, and Disability
The accident, sickness, and disability product line consists of short-term disability plans, accident-only plans providing benefits for injuries on a specified loss basis, and our expanded dental and vision products. It also includes accident, health, and dental plans covering hospital admissions, confinement, surgeries, and dental services on an indemnity basis. 
Premiums for accident, sickness, and disability products are generally based on assumptions for morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own experience. Premiums are primarily individual guaranteed renewable for which we have the ability to change premiums on a state by state basis. A small percentage of the policies are written on a group basis for which we retain the right to change premiums at the individual account level. Premiums for our expanded dental and vision products are generally guaranteed issue with standard industry rates that vary by age and region. 

Profitability is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses. 
The accident, health and dental products qualify as fringe benefits that can be purchased with pre-tax employee dollars under flexible benefits programs. Flexible benefits programs assist employers in managing benefit and compensation packages and provide policyholders the ability to choose benefits that best meet their needs. Laws could be changed to limit or eliminate fringe benefits available on a pre-tax basis, eliminating our ability to continue marketing our products this way. However, we believe our products provide value to our policyholders that will remain even if the tax advantages offered by flexible benefits programs are modified or eliminated. 
Life
Life products are primarily comprised of universal life, whole life, and term life policies. 
Premium rates vary by age and are based on assumptions concerning mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own experience and published industry tables. Premiums for the whole life and level term products are guaranteed for the life of the contract. Premiums for the universal life

products are flexible and may vary at the individual policyholder level. For the group term life products, we retain the right to change premiums at the account level based on the experience of the account.
Profitability is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses. 
Cancer and Critical Illness
Cancer policies provide various benefits for the treatment of cancer including hospitalization, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Critical illness policies provide a lump-sum benefit and/or fixed payments on the occurrence of a covered critical illness event.
Premiums are generally based on assumptions for morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own experience. Premiums are primarily individual guaranteed renewable wherein we have the ability to change premiums on a state by state basis. 
Profitability of these products is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses. 
Closed Block Segment 
Our Closed Block segment consists of individual disability, group and individual long-term care, and other insurance products no longer actively marketed. Closed Block segment premium income for 2018 was comprised of approximately 39 percent individual disability and 61 percent group and individual long-term care.
Individual Disability
We began limiting sales of the types of individual disability policies reported in our Closed Block segment subsequent to the mid-1990s after substantial changes in product design were implemented to improve the overall risk profile of our offerings of individual disability products. We entirely discontinued issuing new policies in this closed block of business in 2004, other than through update features contractually allowable on existing policies. The majority of the policies were written on a noncancelable basis and were marketed on a single-life customer basis. Profitability is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.
Group and Individual Long-term Care 
We discontinued offering individual long-term care in 2009 and group long-term care in 2012, other than features contractually allowable on existing group policies. Group long-term care was previously offered to employers for the benefit of employees. Individual long-term care was previously marketed on a single-life customer basis. 
Long-term care insurance pays a benefit upon the loss of two or more activities of daily living and the insured's requirement of standby assistance or cognitive impairment. Payment is generally made on an indemnity basis, regardless of expenses incurred, up to a lifetime maximum. Benefits begin after a waiting period, usually 90 days or less, and are generally paid for a period of three years, six years, or lifetime. 
Our long-term care insurance was sold on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies, subject to regulatory approval. Premium rates for long-term care vary by age and are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Premium rate increases continue to be implemented where needed and where approved by state regulators. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables. 
Profitability is affected by premium rate increases, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.

Other
Other insurance products not actively marketed include group pension, individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, and other miscellaneous product lines. The majority of these products have been reinsured, with approximately 80 percent of reserves at December 31, 2018 ceded to other insurance companies. 
Corporate Segment
Our Corporate segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, interest expense on corporate debt other than non-recourse debt, and certain other corporate income and expense not allocated to a line of business. 
Reinsurance 
In the normal course of business, we assume reinsurance from and cede reinsurance to other insurance companies. In a reinsurance transaction, a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium. We undertake reinsurance transactions for both risk management and capital management. If the assuming reinsurer in a reinsurance agreement is unable to meet its obligations, we remain contingently liable. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible. We evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to whom we cede business and monitor concentration of credit risk to minimize our exposure. We may also require assets to be held in trust, letters of credit, or other acceptable collateral to support reinsurance recoverable balances. The collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers. Although we have controls to minimize our exposure, the insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
In general, the maximum amount of life insurance risk retained by our U.S. insurance subsidiaries under group or individual life or group or individual accidental death and dismemberment policies during 2018 was $1 million per covered life per policy. The retention amount remains at $1 million for 2019. For Unum Limited life insurance risk, during 2018 we had reinsurance agreements which provided 75 percent coverage up to £500 thousand per covered life for group dependent life benefits and 25 percent coverage for group lump sum benefits, as well as 100 percent coverage per covered life above that amount.  
We have reinsurance agreements on approximately 76 percent of our Closed Block individual disability business. As of December 31, 2018, this reinsurance covers approximately 67 percent of that portion of the consolidated risk above a $4.6 billion retention limit.  The risk limit for the reinsurer grows over time to a maximum of $2.2 billion, after which any further losses will revert to us.
We have global catastrophic reinsurance coverage which covers all Unum Group insurance companies and includes four layers of coverage to limit our exposure under life, accidental death and dismemberment, long-term care, and disability policies in regard to a catastrophic event. Each layer provides coverage for all catastrophic events, including acts of war and any type of terrorism, up to $1 million of coverage per person per policy for each U.S. and non-U.K. line of covered business, and up to £2 million of coverage for each U.K. covered line of business. We have the following coverage for 2019, after a $100 million deductible: 

Layer | Coverage (in millions) | | Percent Coverage
First | $ | 50.0 | | | 50.0 | %
Second | 55.0 | | | 55.0 | 
Third | 90.0 | | | 60.0 | 
Fourth | 180.0 | | | 60.0 | 
Total Catastrophic Coverage | $ | 375.0 | | |

In addition to the global catastrophic reinsurance coverage noted above, Unum Limited has additional catastrophic coverage via an arms-length, inter-company reinsurance agreement with Unum America, under similar terms as the global catastrophic treaties. Unum Limited has the following additional coverage for 2019, after a £75 million deductible:

Layer | Coverage (in millions) | | Percent Coverage
First | £ | 15.0 | | | 20.0 | %
Second | 6.8 | | | 22.5 | 
Total Catastrophic Coverage | £ | 21.8 | | | 

Unum Poland has additional global catastrophic reinsurance coverage of up to zł70 million with a maximum retention limit of zł0.8 million in 2018. Insurable events include passive war, as well as nuclear, chemical, biological and other forms of terrorism. This agreement was renewed with the same conditions for 2019. 
Events may occur which limit or eliminate the availability of catastrophic reinsurance coverage in future years.
We have a quota share reinsurance agreement under which we cede certain blocks of Unum US group long-term disability claims. The agreement is on a combination coinsurance with funds withheld and modified coinsurance basis and provides 90 percent quota share reinsurance on the ceded claims, which was increased from 80 percent during 2018 on all ceded blocks of business. We also have four reinsurance agreements that collectively cede approximately 55 percent of Unum US group life risk up to our per person retention limit for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. These reinsurance agreements for Unum US group disability and group life allow us to more effectively manage capital in conformity with statutory accounting principles but do not meet insurance risk transfer in accordance with applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and therefore are not accounted for as reinsurance in our consolidated GAAP financial statements.
We also cede 30 percent of the risk for certain blocks of recently issued Unum US individual disability policies, as well as some related claims development risk for a limited period of time. The agreement is on a non-proportional modified coinsurance basis with a provision for experience refunds. 
Certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries cede blocks of business to Northwind Reinsurance Company (Northwind Re) and Fairwind Insurance Company (Fairwind), both of which are affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiaries (captive reinsurers) domiciled in the United States, with Unum Group as the ultimate parent. These captive reinsurers were established for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by our insurance subsidiaries in order to effectively manage risks in connection with certain blocks of our business as well as to enhance our capital efficiency. On a consolidated reporting basis for Unum Group, financial statement impacts of our reinsurance arrangements with affiliates are eliminated in accordance with GAAP. 
For further discussion of our reinsurance activities, refer to "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A; "Consolidated Operating Results," "Segment Results," and "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Available from Subsidiaries" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 1, 12, and 15 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8. 
Reserves for Policy and Contract Benefits
The applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies. These reserves are the amounts which, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates, and methods of valuation required for statutory accounting. 
The reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated in conformity with GAAP and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and reported in the statutory financial statements of our life insurance subsidiaries. These differences result from the use of mortality and morbidity tables and interest assumptions which we believe are more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and also result from differences in actuarial reserving methods. 
 10

The assumptions we use to calculate our reserves are intended to represent an estimate of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. If actual experience is equal, or favorable, to our reserve assumptions, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is less favorable than the reserve assumptions, additional reserves may be required. The key experience assumptions include claim incidence rates, claim resolution rates, mortality and morbidity rates, policy persistency, interest rates, premium rate increases, and any applicable policy benefit offsets, including those for social security and other government-based welfare benefits. We periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new issues and reserves for all claims incurred, as we believe appropriate.
The consolidated statements of income include the annual change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits. The change reflects a normal accretion for premium payments and interest buildup and decreases for policy terminations such as lapses, deaths, and benefit payments. If policy reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of a test for loss recognition are higher than existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition costs, the increase in reserves necessary to recognize the deficiency is also included in the change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits. 
For further discussion of reserves, refer to "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A, "Critical Accounting Estimates" and the discussion of segment operating results included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 1 and 6 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8. 
Investments 
Investment activities are an integral part of our business, and profitability is significantly affected by investment results. We segment our invested assets into portfolios that support our various product lines. Generally, our investment strategy for our portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of our businesses. We seek to earn investment income while assuming credit risk in a prudent and selective manner, subject to constraints of quality, liquidity, diversification, and regulatory considerations. Our overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of our insurance products. Assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities. Changes in interest rates may affect the amount and timing of cash flows. 
We actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to limit interest rate risk. We may redistribute investments among our different lines of business, when necessary, to adjust the cash flow and/or duration of the asset portfolios to better match the cash flow and duration of the liability portfolios. Asset and liability portfolio modeling is updated on a quarterly basis and is used as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy. Cash flows from the in-force asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and also at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios. These results enable us to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates. Testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy, as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes. Although we test the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios as part of our modeling, the majority of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive, and we therefore have minimal exposure to policy withdrawal risk. Our determination of investment strategy relies on long-term measures such as reserve adequacy analysis and the relationship between the portfolio yields supporting our various product lines and the aggregate discount rate assumptions embedded in the reserves. We also use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments for managing interest rate risk and the risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
Refer to "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A; "Critical Accounting Estimates" and the discussion of investments in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7; and Notes 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for information on our investments and derivative financial instruments.
Ratings 
AM Best, Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) are among the third parties that assign issuer credit ratings to Unum Group and financial strength ratings to our insurance subsidiaries. Issuer credit ratings reflect an agency's opinion of the overall financial capacity of a company to meet its senior debt obligations. Financial strength ratings are specific to each individual insurance subsidiary and reflect each rating agency's 
 11

view of the overall financial strength (capital levels, earnings, growth, investments, business mix, operating performance, and market position) of the insuring entity and its ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. Both the issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings incorporate quantitative and qualitative analyses by rating agencies and are routinely reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.

Rating agencies assign an outlook statement of "positive," "negative," or "developing" to indicate an intermediate-term trend in credit fundamentals which could lead to a rating change. "Positive" means that a rating may be raised, "negative" means that a rating may be lowered, and "developing" means that a rating may be raised or lowered with equal probability. Alternatively, a rating may have a "stable" outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change. 
"Credit watch" or "under review" highlights the potential direction of a short-term or long-term rating. It focuses on identifiable events and short-term trends that cause a rating to be placed under heightened surveillance by a rating agency. Events that may trigger this action include mergers, acquisitions, recapitalizations, regulatory actions, criteria changes, or operating developments. Ratings may be placed on credit watch or under review when an event or a change in an expected trend occurs and additional information is needed to evaluate the current rating level. This status does not mean that a rating change is inevitable, and ratings may change without first being placed on a watch list. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Ratings" contained herein in Item 7 for our current outlook, issuer credit, and financial strength ratings. See also further discussion in "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A.
Competition 
There is significant competition among insurance companies for the types of products we sell. We are operating in a dynamic competitive environment of both traditional and non-traditional competitors, with changes in product offerings, enrollment services, and technology solutions. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our business are price, quality of the customer experience regarding service and claims management, integrated product choices, enrollment capabilities, financial strength ratings, and claims-paying ratings. In the individual and group disability markets, we compete in the United States with a number of major companies and regionally with other companies offering specialty products. Our principal competitors for our other products, including group life and the product offerings sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction, include the largest insurance companies in the United States. Some of these companies have more competitive pricing or have higher claims-paying ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete. 
In both the United Kingdom and Poland, we compete for the individual and group products we sell with a mix of large internationally recognized providers and strong local carriers. 
We believe the need for the types of products we offer is significant. Individuals and families often live paycheck to paycheck with a considerable chance of being out of work.  Pressure is also mounting on governments as to the sustainability of public assistance.  Based on current penetration levels, we believe there is substantial upside growth potential.
All areas of the employee benefits markets are highly competitive due to the yearly renewable term nature of our products and the large number of insurance companies offering products in this market. There is a risk that our customers may be able to obtain more favorable terms or improved technology solutions from competitors in lieu of renewing coverage with us. The effect of competition may, as a result, adversely affect the persistency of these and other products, as well as our ability to sell products in the future.
We must attract and retain independent agents and brokers to actively market our products. Strong competition exists among insurers for agents and brokers. We compete with other insurers for sales agents and brokers primarily on the basis of our product offerings, financial strength, support services, and compensation. Sales of our products could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining agents and brokers.
For further discussion, refer to "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A.

Regulation
We and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive and comprehensive supervision and regulation in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland. The laws and regulations with which we must comply are complex and subject to change. New or existing laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. As a result of the financial market and economic challenges in recent years, regulation and the cost of compliance with regulation has continued to increase.
Insurance Regulation and Oversight
Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they do business and by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) on a national basis, primarily for the protection of policyholders. State insurance regulators in the U.S. generally have broad powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business, including the power to: license and examine insurance companies; regulate and supervise sales practices and market conduct; license agents and brokers; approve policy forms; approve premium rates and subsequent increases thereon for certain insurance products; establish reserve requirements and solvency standards; place limitations on shareholder dividends; prescribe the form and content of required financial statements and reports; regulate the types and amounts of permitted investments; and regulate reinsurance transactions. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are examined periodically by their states of domicile and by other states in which they are licensed to conduct business. The domestic examinations have traditionally emphasized financial matters from the perspective of protection of policyholders, but they can and have covered other subjects that an examining state may be interested in reviewing, such as market conduct issues. Examinations in other states more typically focus on market conduct, such as a review of sales practices, including the content and use of advertising materials and the licensing and appointing of agents and brokers, as well as underwriting, claims, and customer service practices, and identification and handling of unclaimed property to determine compliance with state laws. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessments by state insurance guaranty associations to cover the proportional cost of insolvent or failed insurers. The DOL enforces a comprehensive federal statute which regulates claims paying fiduciary responsibilities and reporting and disclosure requirements for most employee benefit plans.
Our U.K. insurance subsidiary, Unum Limited, is subject to dual regulation by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The PRA oversees the financial health and stability of financial services firms and is responsible for the prudential regulation and day-to-day supervision of insurance companies. The FCA seeks to protect consumers and oversees financial services products and practices, including those governing insurance companies in the U.K.
In June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum and voted to leave the European Union (EU). The U.K. subsequently invoked Article 50 of the Treaty and is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019. The U.K.'s decision to leave the EU may add cost and complexity to our compliance efforts if new laws and regulations are established that significantly diverge from those currently in place, however, we are not aware of any indications of such changes in the short-term and do not expect significant changes over the longer term. 
Our Polish insurance subsidiary, Unum Poland, is subject to regulation by the Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego (KNF) of the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA) in Poland. The KNF oversees the financial health and stability of financial services firms and is responsible for the prudential regulation and day-to-day supervision of insurance companies and other financial institutions.
Capital Requirements
Risk-based capital (RBC) standards for U.S. life insurance companies are prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The domiciliary states of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries have all adopted a version of the NAIC RBC Model Act, which prescribes a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus for all life and health insurers. The basis of the system is a risk-based formula that applies prescribed factors to the various risk elements in a life and health insurer's business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer. The life and health RBC formula is designed to measure annually (i) the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations, (ii) the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience, (iii) the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates, and (iv) business risks. The formula is used as an early warning tool to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized. The formula is intended to be used as a regulatory tool only and is not intended as a means to rank insurers generally. The NAIC modified the RBC factors in 2018 to reflect the lower U.S. statutory income tax rate that was enacted in 2017 which resulted in lower RBC ratios for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, including our captive reinsurers, as of December 31, 2018. Although the RBC ratios for our insurance subsidiaries are lower than the prior 
 13

year, the ratios continue to remain in line with our expectations and are significantly above the level that would require state regulatory action. The NAIC has also issued a proposal to implement a new and more granular RBC structure for fixed income asset capital charges. The proposed structure will expand the fixed income asset designations from six to 20 categories and will revise factor values. We do not anticipate that the new structure related to fixed income assets will be effective before year end 2019. We will continue to monitor the NAIC's activities on this issue. 
The NAIC continues to review the state-based solvency regulation framework to identify opportunities to respond to national and international insurance regulatory and solvency developments. The topics of its review include capital requirements, governance and risk management, statutory accounting and financial reporting, and reinsurance. This ongoing review will likely result in significant changes to U.S. insurance regulation and solvency standards, including those for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. One of the outcomes of the NAIC's review was the adoption of the NAIC Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) Model Act which, following enactment at the state level, requires insurers to provide, at least annually, a group-level perspective on the risks of the current and future business plans and the sufficiency of capital to support those risks. All states where our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled have enacted ORSA requirements, and we file an ORSA summary report annually with the applicable insurance regulators. 
The NAIC has established a working group charged with developing a group capital calculation that can be used by regulators as a baseline quantitative measure in assessing the risks and financial position of insurance groups.  The initial recommendation for calculation is an RBC aggregation approach that would utilize existing regulatory calculations for legal entities within the group. Items still under development include the scope of the group of legal entities that would be subject to the calculation as well as factors to be used for non-insurance entities and non-U.S. insurance entities within the group. It is too early to predict what, if any, impact this will have on our capital requirements.
The NAIC has adopted a valuation manual containing a principles-based approach to life insurance company reserves. The effective date to begin a three-year implementation period was January 2017 and applies only to new business. The adoption of this valuation manual has not had a material impact on our statutory reserves. 
In 2012, the NAIC established a subgroup to study the insurance industry's use of captive reinsurers and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk and is considering ways to promote uniformity in both the approval and supervision of such reinsurers. More recently, the NAIC adopted a proposal to subject certain captive reinsurers and special purpose vehicles to the same capital requirements as traditional insurers. As the NAIC and state insurance regulators continue to examine the use of captive insurance companies to finance reserves required under current regulations, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of their work, or how long or extensively they will continue to focus on this issue. Although we believe it to be unlikely, a potential outcome of future NAIC decisions from its various committees, task forces, and working groups is that companies could be prohibited from using captive reinsurers. No changes in the use or regulation of captive reinsurers have been proposed by the NAIC, and we are unable to predict the extent of any changes that might be made. Accordingly, we expect to continue our strategy of using captive reinsurers to manage risks and enhance capital efficiency while monitoring the NAIC's study and proposed changes in regulations. See "Reinsurance" contained herein in this Item 1 for further discussion.
The PRA has statutory requirements, including capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and minimum solvency margins, to which Unum Limited must adhere as part of the provisions of Solvency II, an EU directive that prescribes capital requirements and risk management standards for the European insurance industry.  Our European holding company is also subject to the Solvency II requirements relevant to insurance holding companies, while its subsidiaries, which includes Unum Limited, are subject to group supervision under Solvency II. The Unum European Economic Area (EEA) Group, which is comprised of the European holding company and its subsidiaries, received approval from the PRA to use its own internal model for calculating regulatory capital and also received approval for certain associated regulatory permissions including transitional relief as the Solvency II capital regime is implemented.  Although there are currently no indications that the regulatory capital regime for our U.K. operations will change due to the U.K.'s decision to leave the EU, it remains too early to predict what, if any, impact this may have on existing capital requirements for our U.K. entities, but economic conditions may cause volatility in our solvency ratios.
The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is developing a Common Framework (ComFrame) for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups (IAIGs) that contemplates group-wide supervision across national boundaries, including uniform standards for insurer corporate governance and enterprise risk management, a framework for group capital adequacy assessment that accounts for group-wide risks, and the establishment of ongoing supervisory colleges. We do not qualify as an IAIG under the current criteria for designating an IAIG. However, we monitor the activities of the IAIS for the potential that ComFrame could apply to us in the future. The IAIS expects to implement an Insurance Capital Standard in the form of confidential reporting to supervisory colleges by the end of 2019. At this time, we cannot predict what, 
 14

if any, additional capital requirements, compliance costs, or other requirements this proposed standard might impose on us, if adopted.
See further discussion in "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" contained herein in Item 7 and Note 15 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8. 
Insurance Holding Company Regulation
We and our U.S. insurance subsidiaries (excluding captive reinsurers) are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws in the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which currently include Maine, Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina, and Tennessee. These laws generally require each insurance company that is domiciled in the state and a member of an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of that state and to furnish at least annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system, including information concerning capital structure, ownership, management, financial condition, and certain intercompany transactions. Transactions between an insurer and affiliates in the holding company system generally must be fair and reasonable and, if material, require prior notice and approval by the domiciliary insurance regulator.
In addition, such laws and regulations restrict the amount of dividends that may be paid by our insurance subsidiaries to their respective shareholders, including our Company and certain of our intermediate holding company subsidiaries. See further discussion in "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A and "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Available from Subsidiaries" contained herein in Item 7.
There are a number of proposals to amend state insurance laws and regulations in ways that could affect us and our insurance subsidiaries. The NAIC has adopted or amended model laws on holding company regulation that provide for supervision of insurers at the corporate group level. The various proposals to implement group supervision include uniform standards for insurer corporate governance, group-wide supervision of insurance holding companies, adjustments to RBC calculations to account for group-wide risks, and additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies, including a requirement that the ultimate controlling person of a U.S. insurer submit to the lead state insurance regulator an annual enterprise risk report, which identifies activities, circumstances, or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied properly, are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. The NAIC has adopted the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act and the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Regulation, which require U.S. insurers to disclose detailed information regarding their governance practices. The model act and regulation must be adopted by individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective in a particular state. At this time, among the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, the model act and regulation are effective only in Maine, Massachusetts, and Tennessee. The NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law, which creates a legal framework that requires insurance companies to establish cybersecurity programs designed to protect the private data of consumers. The law outlines planned cybersecurity testing, and the development of incident response plans for breach notification procedures. The model law must be adopted by individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective in particular state. At this time, among the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, the model law is effective only in South Carolina. The New York State Department of Financial Services has established similar regulations to this law which became effective in 2017 and the state of California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.
The laws of most states, including the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (or deemed to be commercially domiciled), require regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurance company or its holding company. Where these laws apply to us, there can be no effective change in control of our Company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement containing specified information with the appropriate insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval of the proposed change. The usual measure for a presumptive change of control pursuant to these laws is the acquisition of 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company, although this presumption is rebuttable. Consequently, a person acquiring 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company without the prior approval of the insurance regulators in the state(s) of domicile of the insurance company(ies) sought to be acquired (or whose holding company is sought to be acquired) will be in violation of these laws. Such a person may also be subject to one or more of the following actions: (i) injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those shares by the applicable insurance regulators; (ii) prohibition of voting of such shares; and (iii) other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulators. Further, many states' insurance laws require that prior notification be given to state insurance regulators of a change in control of a non-domiciled insurance company doing business in the state. These pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance regulators to disapprove the change in control; however, they do authorize regulatory action in the affected state if particular conditions exist, such as undue market 
 15

concentration. Any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of our Company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries may require prior notification in those states that have adopted pre-notification laws. 
These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change in control of our Company, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable. 
Federal Laws and Regulations 
Enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) effected comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States. Dodd-Frank directed various government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, many of which remain to be completed. Among other provisions, Dodd-Frank created a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives markets, including requirements that certain swaps be executed through a centralized exchange or regulated facility and be cleared through a regulated clearinghouse. It also subjected us and major swap participants to capital and margin (i.e., collateral) requirements, which generally had the effect of increasing the costs of hedging and the credit risk posed by some counterparties.
Dodd-Frank also established the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of the Treasury, with powers over most lines of insurance, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The FIO is authorized to gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers about insurance matters, and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances. Although the FIO is prohibited from directly regulating the business of insurance, the FIO may also recommend enhanced regulations to state regulatory authorities or recommend to the FSOC that it designate an insurer as a "systemically important financial institution" (SIFI). An insurer designated as a SIFI could be subject to Federal Reserve supervision and heightened regulatory standards. We have not been designated as a SIFI, and at this time we believe it is unlikely that we would be designated as such. We continue to monitor the political, legislative and regulatory environment, where possible amendments to various provisions of Dodd-Frank are under discussion.
We are subject to the laws and regulations generally applicable to public companies, including the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange relating to public reporting and disclosure, accounting and financial reporting, corporate governance, and securities trading. Further, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and rules and regulations adopted under this regulation, have increased the requirements for us and other public companies in these and other areas.
The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (Patriot Act) contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the United States contain some similar provisions. Additionally, other federal laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Asset's Controls, as well as the U.K.'s Bribery Act of 2010, have increased requirements relating to identifying customers, prohibiting transactions with certain organizations or individuals, watching for and reporting suspicious transactions, responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, sharing information with other financial institutions, and requiring the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures, and controls.
We are subject to federal income, employment, excise and other taxes related to both our U.S. and our foreign operations.  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Federal government enacted a tax bill, H.R.1, An Act to Provide Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018, more commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The key provisions of the TCJA relevant to us are as follows: 

• | Establishes a corporate income tax rate of 21 percent;


• | Creates a territorial tax system rather than a worldwide system, which will generally allow companies to repatriate future foreign source earnings without incurring additional U.S. taxes by providing a 100 percent exemption for the foreign source portion of dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries;


• | Subjects undistributed and previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits to a one-time transition tax also referred to as a deemed repatriation toll charge;


• | Creates a U.S. shareholder tax on certain foreign subsidiary income above a routine equity return on tangible depreciable business assets (Global Intangible Low-taxed Income);


• | Decreases tax-deductible life and property and casualty insurance reserves;

 16


• | Increases the amount and amortization period of acquisition costs capitalized for tax purposes;


• | Reduces the maximum deduction for net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards arising in companies other than non-life insurance companies in tax years beginning after 2017 to a percentage of the taxpayer's taxable income. It also allows any NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 to be carried forward indefinitely and repeals carrybacks. NOL provisions for non-life insurance companies remain unchanged from current law; 


• | Allows businesses to immediately write off the cost of new investments in certain qualified depreciable assets made after September 27, 2017 subject to phase downs starting in 2023;


• | Eliminates or reduces certain deductions (including deductions for certain compensation arrangements, certain payments made to governments for violations of law and certain legal settlements), exclusions and credits and adds other provisions that broaden the tax base; and


• | Creates a new base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT) that subjects certain payments made by a U.S. company to a related foreign company to additional taxes.

See "Executive Summary" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" contained herein in Item 7 and Notes 7 and 15 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for discussion of the impact to our financial position and results of operations as a result of these changes. 
Federal tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such change could materially impact our federal taxes and reduce profitability as well as capital levels in our insurance subsidiaries.  We continually monitor federal tax legislative and regulatory developments to understand their potential impact on our profitability. 
For further discussion of regulation, refer to "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A.
Geographic Areas
Adjusted operating revenue, which excludes net realized investment gains and losses, for our Unum International segment was approximately 6 percent of our consolidated adjusted operating revenue in 2018, 2017, and 2016. As of December 31, 2018, total assets equaled approximately 6 percent of consolidated assets and total liabilities equaled approximately 5 percent of consolidated liabilities for our Unum International segment. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies of our Unum International segment will impact our reported operating results. See "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A and "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" contained herein in Item 7A for further discussion of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
