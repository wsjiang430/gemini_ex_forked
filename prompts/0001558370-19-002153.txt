 Item 1. Business
 General
 FS Bancorp, Inc. (“FS Bancorp” or the “Company”), a Washington corporation, was organized in September 2011 for the purpose of becoming the holding company of 1st Security Bank of Washington (“1st Security Bank of Washington” or  the “Bank”) upon the Bank’s conversion from a mutual to a stock savings bank (“Conversion”). The Conversion was completed on July 9, 2012. At December 31, 2018, the Company had consolidated total assets of $1.62 billion, total deposits of $1.27 billion, and stockholders’ equity of $180.0 million. The Company has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K (“Form 10‑K”), including the consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank.
 1st Security Bank of Washington is a relationship-driven community bank. The Bank delivers banking and financial services to local families, local and regional businesses and industry niches within distinct Puget Sound area communities. The Bank emphasizes long-term relationships with families and businesses within the communities served, working with them to meet their financial needs. The Bank is also actively involved in community activities and events within these market areas, which further strengthens relationships within these markets. The Bank has been serving the Puget Sound area since 1936. Originally chartered as a credit union, and known as Washington’s Credit Union, the Bank served various select employment groups. On April 1, 2004, the Bank converted from a credit union to a Washington state-chartered mutual savings bank. Upon completion of the Conversion in July 2012, 1st Security Bank of Washington became a Washington state-chartered stock savings bank and the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 At December 31, 2018, the Bank maintained its main administrative office that also accepts deposits, 21 full-service bank branches and eight home loan production offices in suburban communities in the greater Puget Sound area. The Bank also has one home loan production office in the Tri-Cities, Washington. On November 15, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Anchor Bancorp which was merged with and into the Company, and immediately thereafter Anchor’s bank subsidiary, Anchor Bank was merged with and into 1st Security Bank of Washington (the “Anchor Acquisition”). The Anchor Acquisition added nine full-service bank branches within Grays Harbor, Thurston, Lewis, and Pierce counties, and one loan production office located in King County, Washington. The Anchor Acquisition expanded our Puget Sound-focused retail footprint and provided an opportunity to extend our unique brand of community banking into those communities. For additional information on the Anchor Acquisition, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10‑K. 
 The Company is a diversified lender with a focus on the origination of one-to-four-family, commercial real estate, consumer, including indirect home improvement (“fixture secured loans”),  solar and marine lending, commercial business and second mortgage or home equity loans. Historically, consumer loans, in particular fixture secured loans had represented the largest portion of the Company’s loan portfolio and had been the mainstay of the Company’s lending strategy.  In recent years, the Company has placed more of an emphasis on real estate lending products, such as one-to-four-family, commercial real estate, including speculative residential construction, as well as commercial business loans, while growing the current size of the consumer loan portfolio. The Company reintroduced in-house originations of residential mortgage loans in 2012, primarily for sale into the secondary market, through a mortgage banking program. The Company’s lending strategies are intended to take advantage of: (1) the Company’s historical strength in indirect consumer lending, (2) recent market consolidation that has created new lending opportunities, and (3) relationship lending. Retail deposits will continue to serve as an important funding source. For more information regarding the business and operations of 1st Security Bank of Washington, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10‑K.
 1st Security Bank of Washington is examined and regulated by the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (“DFI”), its primary regulator, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). 1st Security Bank of Washington is required to have certain reserves set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) and is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (“FHLB” or “FHLB of Des Moines”), which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.

 The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 6920 220th Street SW, Mountlake Terrace, Washington 98043 and its telephone number is (425) 771‑5299.
 Market Area
 The Company conducts operations out of its main administrative office, nine home loan production offices (five of which stand alone), and 21 full-service bank branches in the Puget Sound region of Washington, and one of the stand-alone loan production offices in Eastern Washington. The administrative office is located in Mountlake Terrace, in Snohomish County, Washington. The four stand-alone home lending offices in the Puget Sound region are located in Puyallup, in Pierce County, Bellevue, in King County, Port Orchard, in Kitsap County, Everett, in Snohomish County, and in Eastern Washington located in the Tri-Cities (Kennewick), in Benton County, Washington. The 21 full-service bank branches are located in the following counties: three in Snohomish, two in King, two in Clallam, two in Jefferson, two in Pierce, five in Grays Harbor, two in Thurston, one in Lewis, and two in Kitsap County. 
 The primary market area for business operations is the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area (the “Seattle MSA”).  Kitsap, Clallam, Jefferson, Thurston, Lewis, and Grays Harbor counties, though not in the Seattle MSA, are also part of the Company’s market area. This overall region is typically known as the Puget Sound region. The population of the Puget Sound region as estimated by Puget Sound Regional Council was 4.1 million in 2018, over half of the state’s population, representing a large population base for potential business. The region has a well-developed urban area in the western portion along Puget Sound, with the north, central and eastern portions containing a mixture of developed residential and commercial neighborhoods and undeveloped, rural neighborhoods.
 The Puget Sound region is the largest business center in both the State of Washington and the Pacific Northwest. Currently, key elements of the economy are aerospace, military bases, clean technology, biotechnology, education, information technology, logistics, international trade and tourism. The region is well known for the long presence of The Boeing Corporation and Microsoft, two major industry leaders, and for its leadership in technology. Amazon.com has expanded significantly in the Seattle downtown area. The workforce in general is well-educated and strong in technology. Washington State’s location with regard to the Pacific Rim, along with a deepwater port has made international trade a significant part of the regional economy. Tourism has also developed into a major industry for the area, due to the scenic beauty, temperate climate and easy accessibility.
 King County, the location of the city of Seattle, has the largest employment base and overall level of economic activity. Six of the largest employers in the state are headquartered in King County including Microsoft Corporation, University of Washington, Amazon.com, King County Government, Starbucks, and Swedish Health Services. Pierce County is the second most populous county in the state and its economy is also well diversified with the presence of military related government employment (Joint Base Lewis-McChord), along with health care (the Multicare Health System and the Franciscan Health System). In addition, there is a large employment base in the economic sectors of shipping (the Port of Tacoma) and aerospace employment (Boeing). Snohomish County to the north has an economy based on aerospace employment (Boeing), health care (Providence Regional Medical Center), and military (the Everett Naval Station) along with additional employment concentrations in biotechnology, electronics/computers, and wood products. 
 The United States Navy is a key element for Kitsap County’s economy. The United States Navy is the largest employer in the county, with installations at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Keyport and Naval Base Kitsap (which comprises former Naval Submarine Base Bangor, and Naval Station Bremerton). The largest private employers in the county are the Harrison Medical Center and Port Madison Enterprises.  Clallam County depends on agriculture, forestry, fishing, outdoor recreation and tourism.  Jefferson County’s largest private employer is Port Townsend Paper Mill and the largest employer overall (private and public) is Jefferson Healthcare. 
 From the Anchor Acquisition, we have entered three new counties, Thurston, Lewis, and Grays Harbor. Thurston County includes Olympia, home of Washington State’s capital and its economic base is largely driven by state government related employment.  Lewis County is supported by manufacturing, retail trade, local government and industrial services.  Grays Harbor County has been historically dependent on the timber and fishing industries, but also relies on tourism, manufacturing, agriculture, shipping, transportation, and technology.

 Lending Activities
 General. Historically, the Company’s primary emphasis was the origination of consumer loans (primarily indirect home improvement loans), one-to-four-family residential first mortgages, and second mortgage/home equity loan products. As a result of the Company’s initial public offering in 2012, while maintaining the active indirect consumer lending program, the Company shifted its lending focus to include non-mortgage commercial business loans, as well as commercial real estate which includes construction and development loans. The Company reintroduced in-house originations of residential mortgage loans in 2012, primarily for sale in the secondary market. While maintaining the Company’s historical strength in consumer lending, the Company has added management and personnel in the commercial and home lending areas to take advantage of the relatively favorable long-term business and economic environments prevailing in the markets.

 Lending Authority. The Chief Credit Officer has the authority to approve multiple loans to one borrower up to $6.0 million in aggregate. Loans in excess of $10.0 million require an additional signature from the Chief Executive Officer and/or Chief Financial Officer. All loans that are approved over $2.5 million are reported to the Asset Quality Committee (“AQC”) at each AQC meeting. The Chief Credit Officer may delegate lending authority to other individuals at levels consistent with their responsibilities.
 The Board of Directors has implemented a lending limit policy that it believes matches the Washington State legal lending limit. At December 31, 2018, the Company’s policy limits loans to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities to 20% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus, or $39.1 million at December 31, 2018.  Management has adopted an internal lending limit of a maximum of 80% of the Bank’s legal lending limit for risk mitigation purposes and all loans over this limit require approval from the AQC. The Bank’s largest lending relationship at December 31, 2018, consisted of a commercial line of credit to one company having a commitment of $24.0 million. This line of credit is secured by notes to finance residential construction projects located primarily in Seattle, Washington.  The outstanding balance of this line of credit at December 31, 2018 was $24.0 million. The second largest lending relationship consisted of 11 residential construction loans having combined commitments of $18.2 million to two related limited liability companies. All of these loans are secured by residential construction loan projects located in the Seattle metropolitan area of Washington State.  The outstanding balance of these 11 loans at December 31, 2018 was $16.1 million. The third largest lending relationship consisted of two commercial lines of credit having combined commitments of $18.0 million, to two related limited liability companies.  Both of these loans are secured by notes to finance residential construction projects located primarily in Seattle, Washington. The outstanding balance of these two lines of credit at December 31, 2018 was $12.0 million. All of the loans listed above were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at December 31, 2018.
 At December 31, 2018, the Company had $87.0 million in approved commercial construction warehouse lending lines for nine companies. The commitments range from $5.0 million to $24.0 million. At December 31, 2018, there was $61.4 million outstanding, compared to $84.7 million approved in commercial construction warehouse lending lines for nine companies with $34.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2017.  In addition, the Company had $23.0 million approved in mortgage warehouse lending lines for four companies. The commitments ranged from $4.0 million to $8.0 million. At December 31, 2018, there was $4.4 million in mortgage warehouse lines outstanding, compared to $35.0 million approved in mortgage warehouse lending lines with $7.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2017.
 Commercial Real Estate Lending. The Company offers a variety of commercial real estate loans. Most of these loans are secured by income producing properties, including multi-family residences, retail centers, warehouses and office buildings located in the market areas. At December 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans (including $104.7 million of multi-family residential loans) totaled $309.4 million, or 23.3%, of the gross loan portfolio.
 The Company’s loans secured by commercial real estate are originated with a fixed or variable interest rate for up to a 15‑year maturity and a 30‑year amortization. The variable rate loans are indexed to the prime rate of interest or a short-term LIBOR rate, or five or seven-year FHLB rate, with rates equal to the prevailing index rate to 5.0% above the prevailing rate. Loan-to-value ratios on the Company’s commercial real estate loans typically do not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. In addition, personal guarantees are obtained from the primary borrowers on substantially all credits.
 Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally underwritten based on the net operating income of the property and the financial strength of the borrower. The net operating income, which is the income derived from the operation of the property less all operating expenses, must be sufficient to cover the payments related to the outstanding debt plus an additional coverage requirement. The Company generally requires an assignment of rents or leases in order to be assured that the cash flow from the project will be sufficient to repay the debt. Appraisals on properties securing commercial real estate loans are performed by independent state certified or licensed fee appraisers. The Company does not generally maintain insurance or tax escrows for loans secured by commercial real estate. In order to monitor the adequacy of cash flows on income-producing properties, the borrower is required to provide financial information on at least an annual basis.

 Loans secured by commercial real estate properties generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans. These loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Because payments on loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, or if leases are not obtained or renewed, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Commercial and multi-family loans also expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by one-to-four-family because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as one-to-four-family. In addition, most of our commercial and multi-family loans are not fully amortizing and include balloon payments upon maturity. Balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment. The largest single commercial real estate loan at December 31, 2018 was a 15.9% participation loan originated by another bank in the Puget Sound area. The Bank’s share of the total outstanding loan at December 31, 2018 was $8.2 million, and is collateralized by commercial real estate located in Thurston County, Washington. At December 31, 2018 this loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms.
 The Company intends to continue to emphasize commercial real estate lending and, as a result, the Company has assembled a highly experienced team, with an average of over 20 years of experience. The Bank’s Chief Credit Officer and Chief Lending Officer are both senior bankers with over 30 years of commercial lending experience in the northwestern U.S. region. Management has also hired experienced commercial loan officers to support the Company’s commercial real estate lending objectives. As the commercial loan portfolio expands, the Company intends to bring in additional experienced personnel in the areas of loan analysis and commercial deposit relationship management.
 Construction and Development Lending. The Company expanded its residential construction lending team in 2011 with a focus on vertical, in-city one-to-four-family development in our market area. This team has over 60 years of combined experience and expertise in acquisition, development and construction (“ADC”) lending in the Puget Sound market area. The Company has implemented this strategy to take advantage of what is believed to be a strong demand for construction and ADC loans to experienced, successful and relationship driven builders in our market area after many other banks abandoned this segment because of previous overexposure. At December 31, 2018, outstanding construction and development loans totaled $247.3 million, or 18.7%, of the gross loan portfolio and consisted of 279 projects, compared to $143.1 million and 188 projects at December 31, 2017. The construction and development loans at December 31, 2018, consisted of loans for residential and commercial construction projects primarily for vertical construction and $16.7 million of land acquisition and development loans. Total committed, including unfunded construction and development loans at December 31, 2018, was $333.2 million. At December 31, 2018, $142.0 million, or 57.4% of our outstanding construction and development loan portfolio was comprised of speculative one-to-four-family construction loans. Approximately $9.3 million of our residential construction loans at December 31, 2018 were made to finance the custom construction of owner-occupied homes and are structured to be converted to permanent loans at the end of the construction phase.  In addition, the Company had nine commercial secured lines of credit, secured by notes to residential construction borrowers with guarantees from principles with experience in the construction re-lending market. These loans had combined commitments of $87.0 million, and an outstanding balance of $61.4 million at December 31, 2018.
 The Company’s residential construction lending program includes loans for the purpose of constructing both speculative and pre-sold one-to-four-family residences, the acquisition of in-city lots with and without existing improvements for later development of one-to-four-family residences, the acquisition of land to be developed, and loans for the acquisition and development of land for future development of single family residences. The Company generally limits these types of loans to known builders and developers in the market area. Construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest-only during the construction phase, which is typically up to 12 months. At the end of the construction phase, the construction loan is generally paid off through the sale of the newly constructed home and a permanent loan from another lender, although commitments to convert to a permanent loan may be made by us. Construction loans are generally made with a maximum loan amount of the lower of 95% of cost or 75% of appraised value at completion. During the term of construction, the accumulated interest on the loan is typically added to the principal balance of the loan through an interest reserve of 3% to 5.5% of the loan commitment amount.

 
  12

 

 Commitments to fund construction loans generally are made subject to an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. The Company also reviews and has a licensed third-party inspect each property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection by a third-party inspector based on the percentage of completion method.
 The Company may also make land acquisition and development loans to builders or residential lot developers on a limited basis. These loans involve a higher degree of credit risk, similar to commercial construction loans. At December 31, 2018, included in the $247.3 million of construction and development loans, were 10 residential land acquisition and development loans for finished lots totaling $13.7 million, with total commitments of $17.1 million. These land loans also involve additional risks because the loan amount is based on the projected value of the lots after development. Loans are made for up to 75% of the estimated value with a term of up to two years. These loans are required to be paid on an accelerated basis as the lots are sold, so that the Company is repaid before all the lots are sold. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than longer-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate.
 Construction and development lending contains the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property’s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost (including interest) of the project. Changes in the demand, such as for new housing and higher than anticipated building costs may cause actual results to vary significantly from those estimated. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. This type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. In addition, during the term of most of our construction loans, an interest reserve is created at origination and is added to the principal of the loan through the construction phase. If the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted at, or prior to, the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment. Because construction loans require active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more difficult and costly to monitor.
 Increases in market rates of interest may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans by rapidly increasing the end-purchasers’ borrowing costs, thereby reducing the overall demand for the project. Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold which also complicates the process of working out problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder to complete construction. Furthermore, speculative construction loans to a builder are often associated with homes that are not pre-sold, and thus pose a greater potential risk than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences as there is the added risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project. Loans on land under development or held for future construction pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral. These risks can be significantly impacted by supply and demand. As a result, this type of lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor themselves to repay principal and interest.
 The Company seeks to address the forgoing risks associated with construction development lending by developing and adhering to underwriting policies, disbursement procedures, and monitoring practices. Specifically, the Company (i) seeks to diversify the number of loans and projects in the market area, (ii) evaluate and document the creditworthiness of the borrower and the viability of the proposed project, (iii) limit loan-to-value ratios to specified levels, (iv) control disbursements on construction loans on the basis of on-site inspections by a licensed third-party,  (v) monitor economic conditions and the housing inventory in each market, and (iv) personal guarantees are obtained from the primary borrowers on substantially all credits. No assurances, however, can be given that these practices will be successful in mitigating the risks of construction development lending.
 Home Equity Lending. The Company has been active in second mortgage and home equity lending, with the focus of this lending being conducted in the Company’s primary market area. The home equity lines of credit generally have adjustable rates tied to the prime rate of interest with a draw term of 10 years plus and a term to maturity of 15 years. Monthly payments are based on 1.0% of the outstanding balance with a maximum combined loan-to-value ratio of up to 90%, including any underlying first mortgage. Fixed second mortgage home equity loans are 

 
  13

 
typically amortizing loans with terms of up to 20 years. Total second mortgage/home equity loans totaled $40.3 million, or 3.0% of the gross loan portfolio, at December 31, 2018, $26.1 million of which were adjustable rate home equity lines of credit. Unfunded commitments on home equity lines of credit at December 31, 2018, was $41.2 million.
 Residential. The Company originates loans secured by first mortgages on one-to-four-family residences primarily in the market area. The Company originates one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans through referrals from real estate agents, financial planners, builders, and from existing customers. Retail banking customers are also important referral sources of the Company’s loan originations. The Company originated $711.3 million of one-to-four-family consumer mortgages (including $7.1 million loans brokered to other institutions) and sold $637.7 million to investors in 2018. Of the loans sold to investors, $417.3 million were sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”), the FHLB, and/or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) with servicing rights retained in order to further build the relationship with the customer. At December 31, 2018, one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans totaled $249.4 million, or 18.8%, of the gross loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale of $51.2 million. In addition, the Company originated $11.8 million in residential loans through our commercial lending channel, secured by single family rental homes in Washington, with combined commitments of $57.2 million, and an outstanding balance of $57.0 million at December 31, 2018, classified as commercial business loans that are not included in our one-to-four-family residential mortgage loan portfolio. See “Commercial Business Lending.”
 The Company generally underwrites the one-to-four-family loans based on the applicant’s ability to repay. This includes employment and credit history and the appraised value of the subject property. The Company will lend up to 100% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price for one-to-four-family first mortgage loans. For first mortgage loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80%, the Company generally requires either private mortgage insurance or government sponsored insurance in order to mitigate the higher risk level associated with higher loan-to-value loans. Fixed-rate loans secured by one-to-four-family residences have contractual maturities of up to 30 years and are generally fully amortizing, with payments due monthly. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally pose different credit risks than fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise the borrower’s payments rise, increasing the potential for default. Properties securing the one-to-four-family loans are appraised by independent fee appraisers who are selected in accordance with industry and regulatory standards. The Company requires borrowers to obtain title and hazard insurance, and flood insurance, if necessary. Loans are generally underwritten to the secondary market guidelines with overlays as determined by the internal underwriting department.
 Consumer Lending. Consumer lending represents a significant and important historical activity for the Company, primarily reflecting the indirect lending through home improvement contractors and dealers. At December 31, 2018, consumer loans totaled $275.5 million, or 20.8% of the gross loan portfolio.
 The Company’s indirect home improvement loans, also referred to as fixture secured loans, represent the largest portion of the consumer loan portfolio and have traditionally been the mainstay of the Company’s consumer lending strategy. These loans totaled $167.8 million, or 12.7% of the gross loan portfolio, and 60.9% of total consumer loans, at December 31, 2018. Indirect home improvement loans are originated through a network of 162 home improvement contractors and dealers located in Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Colorado, and recently in Arizona. Ten dealers are responsible for a majority, or 54.1% of the loan volume. These fixture secured loans consist of loans for a wide variety of products, such as replacement windows, siding, roofs, HVAC systems, roofing materials, and pools.
 In connection with fixture secured and solar loans, the Company receives loan applications from the dealers, and originates the loans based on pre-defined lending criteria. These loans are processed through the loan origination software, with approximately 20% of the loan applications receiving an automated approval based on the information provided, and the remaining loans are processed by the Company’s credit analysts. The Company follows the internal underwriting guidelines in evaluating loans obtained through the indirect dealer program, including using a Fair Isaac and Company, Incorporated (“FICO”), credit score to approve loans. A FICO score is a principal measure of credit quality and is one of the significant criteria we rely upon in our underwriting in addition to the borrower’s debt to income.

 The Company’s fixture secured and solar loans generally range in amounts from $2,500 to $50,000, and generally carry terms of 12 to 20 years with fixed rates of interest. In some instances, the participating dealer may pay a fee to buy down the borrower’s interest rate to a rate below the Company’s published rate. Fixture secured and solar loans are secured by the personal property installed in, on or at the borrower’s real property, and may be perfected with a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC-2”) filed in the county of the borrower’s residence. The Company generally files a UCC‑2 financing statement to perfect the security interest in the personal property in situations where the borrower’s credit score is below 720 or the home improvement loan is for an amount in excess of $5,000. Perfection gives the Company a claim to the collateral that is superior to someone that obtains a lien through the judicial process subsequent to the perfection of a security interest. The failure to perfect a security interest does not render the security interest unenforceable against the borrower. However, failure to perfect a security interest risks avoidance of the security interest in bankruptcy or subordination to the claims of third parties.
 The Company also offers consumer marine loans secured by boats. At December 31, 2018, the marine loan portfolio totaled $57.8 million, or 21.0% of total consumer loans. Marine loans are originated with borrowers on both a direct and indirect basis, and generally carry terms of up to 20 years with fixed rates of interest. The Company generally requires a 10% down payment, and the loan amount may be up to the lesser of 120% of factory invoice or 90% of the purchase price.
 Solar loans mentioned above with fixture secured loans represent the third largest segment of the consumer loan portfolio following marine loans.  At December 31, 2018, the solar loan portfolio totaled $44.4 million, or 16.1% of total consumer loans.
 The Company originates other consumer loans which totaled $5.4 million at December 31, 2018.  These loans primarily include personal lines of credit, credit cards, automobile, direct home improvement, loans on deposit, and recreational loans.
 In evaluating any consumer loan application, a borrower’s FICO score is utilized as an important indicator of credit risk. The FICO score represents the creditworthiness of a borrower based on the borrower’s credit history, as reported by an independent third party. A higher FICO score typically indicates a greater degree of creditworthiness. Over the last several years the Company has emphasized originations of loans to consumers with higher credit scores. This has resulted in a lower level of loan charge-offs in recent periods.  At December 31, 2018, 71.3% of the consumer loan portfolio was originated with borrowers having a FICO score over 720 at the time of origination, and 24.5% was originated with borrowers having a FICO score between 660 and 720 at the time of origination.  Generally, a FICO score of 660 or higher indicates the borrower has an acceptable credit reputation. A credit score at the time of loan origination of less than 660 is considered “subprime” by federal banking regulators and these loans comprised just 4.2% of our consumer loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. Consideration for loans with FICO scores below 660 require additional management oversight and approval.
 Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities.
 Consumer and other loans generally entail greater risk than do one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as boats, automobiles and other recreational vehicles. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. In the case of fixture secured and solar loans, it is very difficult to repossess the personal property securing these loans as they are typically attached to the borrower’s personal residence. Accordingly, if a borrower defaults on a fixture secured or solar loan the only practical recourse is to wait until the borrower wants to sell or refinance the home, at which time if there is a perfected security interest the Company generally will be able to collect a percentage of the loan previously charged off.

 Commercial Business Lending. The Company originates commercial business loans and lines of credit to local small- and mid-sized businesses in the Puget Sound market area that are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, or personal/business property, plant and equipment. Consistent with management’s objectives to expand commercial business lending, in 2009, the Company commenced a mortgage warehouse lending program through which the Company funds third-party residential mortgage bankers. Under this program the Company provides short-term funding to the mortgage banking companies for the purpose of originating residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. The Company’s warehouse lending lines are secured by the underlying notes associated with one-to-four-family mortgage loans made to borrowers by the mortgage banking company and generally require guarantees from the principal shareholder(s) of the mortgage banking company. These loans are repaid when the note is sold by the mortgage bank into the secondary market, with the proceeds from the sale used to pay down the outstanding loan before being dispersed to the mortgage bank. The Company had $23.0 million approved in residential mortgage warehouse lending lines for four companies at December 31, 2018. The commitments ranged from $4.0 million to $8.0 million. At December 31, 2018, there was $4.4 million in residential warehouse lines outstanding, compared to $35.0 million in approved residential warehouse lending lines with $7.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2017.
 The Company also has commercial construction warehouse lines secured by notes on construction loans and typically guaranteed by principles with experience in construction lending. In April 2013, we commenced an expansion of our mortgage warehouse lending program to include construction re-lending warehouse lines. These lines are secured by notes provided to construction lenders and are typically guaranteed by a principle of the borrower.  Terms for the underlying notes can be up to 18 months and the Bank will lend a percentage (typically 75%) of the underlying note which may have a loan-to-value ratio up to 75%.  Combined, the loan-to-value ratio on the underlying note would be up to 52.5% with additional credit support provided by the guarantor. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $87.0 million in approved commercial construction warehouse lending lines for nine companies. The commitments range from $5.0 million to $24.0 million. At December 31, 2018, there was $61.4 million outstanding, compared to $84.7 million approved in commercial warehouse lending lines for eight companies with $34.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2017. 
 Commercial business loans may be fixed-rate, but are usually adjustable-rate loans indexed to the prime rate of interest, plus a margin. Some of the commercial business loans, such as those made pursuant to the warehouse lending program, are structured as lines of credit with terms of 12 months and interest-only payments required during the term, while other loans may reprice on an annual basis and amortize over a two to five year period. Due to the current interest rate environment, these loans and lines of credit are generally originated with a floor, which is set between 2.0% and 7.0%. Loan fees are generally charged at origination depending on the credit quality and account relationships of the borrower. Advance rates on these types of lines are generally limited to 80% of accounts receivable and 50% of inventory. The Company also generally requires the borrower to establish a deposit relationship as part of the loan approval process. At December 31, 2018, the commercial business loan portfolio totaled $204.4 million, or 15.4%, of the gross loan portfolio including warehouse lending loans.
 At December 31, 2018, most of the commercial business loans were secured. The Company’s commercial business lending policy includes credit file documentation and analysis of the borrower’s background, capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the borrower’s capital and collateral, as well as an evaluation of other conditions affecting the borrower. Analysis of the borrower’s past, present and future cash flows is also an important aspect of credit analysis. The Company generally requires personal guarantees on commercial business loans. Nonetheless, commercial business loans are believed to carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage loans. The two largest commercial business lending relationships consisted of one line of credit to one company, and two lines of credit to two related limited liability companies.  The first line of credit loan or lending relationship at December 31, 2018 consisted of a commercial line of credit having a commitment of $24.0 million.  This line of credit is secured by residential construction projects located primarily in Seattle, Washington.  The outstanding balance of this line of credit at December 31, 2018 was $24.0 million. The second of the two largest commercial business lending relationships consisted of two commercial lines of credit having combined commitments of $18.0 million.  Both of these lines of credit are secured by notes to finance residential construction projects located primarily in Seattle, Washington.  The outstanding balance of these two lines of credit at December 31, 2018 was $12.0 million.

 Unlike residential mortgage loans, commercial business loans, particularly unsecured loans, are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business and, therefore, are of higher risk. The Company makes commercial loans secured by business assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, real estate and cash as collateral with loan-to-value ratios in most cases up to 80%, based on the type of collateral. This collateral depreciates over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the specific type of business and equipment used. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself (which, in turn, is often dependent in part upon general economic conditions).
 Loan Originations, Servicing, Purchases and Sales
 The Company originates both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans. The ability to originate loans, however, is dependent upon customer demand for loans in the market areas. From time to time to supplement our loan originations and based on our asset/liability objectives we will also purchase bulk loans or pools of loans from other financial institutions.
 Over the past few years, the Company has continued to originate consumer loans, and increased emphasis on commercial real estate loans, including construction and development lending, as well as commercial business loans. Demand is affected by competition and the interest rate environment. In periods of economic uncertainty, the ability of financial institutions, including us, to originate large dollar volumes of commercial business and real estate loans may be substantially reduced or restricted, with a resultant decrease in interest income. In addition to interest earned on loans and loan origination fees, the Company receives fees for loan commitments, late payments and other miscellaneous services. The fees vary from time to time, generally depending on the supply of funds and other competitive conditions in the market.
 The Company will sell long-term, fixed-rate residential real estate loans in the secondary market to mitigate interest rate risk. These loans are generally sold for cash in amounts equal to the unpaid principal amount of the loans determined using present value yields to the buyer. Some residential real estate loans originated as Federal Housing Administration or FHA, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or VA, or United States Department of Agriculture or USDA Rural Housing loans were sold by the Company as servicing released loans to other companies. A majority of residential real estate loans sold by the Company were sold with servicing retained at a specified servicing fee. The Company earned gross mortgage servicing fees of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  The Company was servicing $1.19 billion of one-to-four-family loans at December 31, 2018, for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the FHLB, and another financial institution. These mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) constituted a $10.4 million asset on our books on that date, which is amortized in proportion to and over the period of the net servicing income. These MSRs are periodically evaluated for impairment based on their fair value, which takes into account the rates and potential prepayments of those sold loans being serviced. The fair value of our MSRs at December 31, 2018 was $14.6 million. See Notes 5 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10‑K.

      Sales of whole real estate loans and participations in real estate loans can be beneficial to us since these sales systematically generate income at the time of sale, produce future servicing income on loans where servicing is retained, provide funds for additional lending and other investments, and increase liquidity.
 From time to time we also sell whole consumer loans, specifically long term consumer loans, which can be beneficial to us since these sales generate income at the time of sale, can potentially create future servicing income where servicing is retained, and provide a mitigation of interest rate risk associated with holding 15‑20 year maturity consumer loans.
 Asset Quality
 When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a residential real estate loan, the Company attempts to cure the delinquency by contacting the borrower. In the case of loans secured by residential real estate, a late notice typically is sent 16 days after the due date, and the borrower is contacted by phone within 16 to 25 days after the due date. When the loan is 30 days past due, an action plan is formulated for the credit under the direction of the Loan Control department manager. Generally, a delinquency letter is mailed to the borrower. All delinquent accounts are reviewed by a loan control representative who attempts to cure the delinquency by contacting the borrower once the loan is 30 days past due. If the account becomes 60 days delinquent and an acceptable repayment plan has not been agreed upon, a Loan Control representative will generally refer the account to legal counsel with instructions to prepare a notice of intent to foreclose. The notice of intent to foreclose allows the borrower up to 30 days to bring the account current. Between 90 - 120 days past due, a value is obtained for the loan collateral. At that time, a mortgage analysis is completed to determine the loan-to-value ratio and any collateral deficiency. If foreclosed, the Company customarily takes title to the property and sells it directly through a real estate broker.
 Delinquent consumer loans are handled in a similar manner. Appropriate action is taken in the form of phone calls and notices to collect any loan payment that is delinquent more than 16 days. Once the loan is 90 days past due, it is classified as non-accrual. Generally, credits are charged off if past due 120 days, unless the collections department provides support for a customer repayment plan. Bank procedures for repossession and sale of consumer collateral are subject to various requirements under the applicable consumer protection laws as well as other applicable laws and the determination by us that it would be beneficial from a cost basis.
 Delinquent commercial business loans and loans secured by commercial real estate are handled by the loan officer in charge of the loan, who is responsible for contacting the borrower. The loan officer works with outside counsel and, in the case of real estate loans, a third party consultant to resolve problem loans. In addition, management meets as needed and reviews past due and classified loans, as well as other loans that management feels may present possible collection problems, which are reported to the AQC and the board on a monthly basis. If an acceptable workout of a delinquent commercial loan cannot be agreed upon, the Company customarily will initiate foreclosure or repossession proceedings on any collateral securing the loan.

      For the year ended December 31, 2018, gross interest income which would have been recorded had the non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $45,000.  Prior to non-accrual status, the amount of interest income included in net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $141,000 for these loans.
 Real Estate Owned. Real estate acquired by the Company as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold. When the property is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of its cost, which is the unpaid principal balance of the related loan plus foreclosure costs, or the fair market value of the property less selling costs. The Company had two real estate owned properties as of December 31, 2018.
 Restructured Loans. According to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America  (“U.S. GAAP”), the Company is required to account for certain loan modifications or restructuring as a “troubled debt restructuring” or “TDR”.  In general, the modification or restructuring of a debt is considered a TDR if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrowers that would not otherwise be considered.  The Company had no TDRs at December 31, 2018.
 Other Assets Especially Mentioned. At December 31, 2018, there was $254,000 of loans with respect to which known information about the possible credit problems of the borrowers caused management to have doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such items in the non-performing asset categories.  
 Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets (such as other real estate owned and repossessed property), debt and equity securities, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and pay capacity of the borrower or of any collateral pledged. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the 

 
  22

 
weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
 When the Company classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, a specific allowance may be established in an amount deemed prudent to address specific impairments. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as a loss, it is required to charge off those assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. The Company’s determination as to the classification of assets and the amount of valuation allowances is subject to review by the FDIC and the DFI, which can order the establishment of additional loss allowances. Assets which do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated as special mention.
 In connection with the filing of periodic reports with the FDIC and in accordance with the Company’s classification of assets policy, the Company regularly reviews the problem assets in the portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of the review of the Company’s assets, at December 31, 2018, the Company had classified $8.0 million of assets as substandard. The $8.0 million of classified assets represented 4.4% of equity and 0.5% of total assets at December 31, 2018. The Company had $254,000 of assets classified as special mention at December 31, 2018, not included in classified assets reported above.
 Allowance for Loan Losses
 The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on ongoing, monthly assessments of the estimated probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. Ultimate losses may vary from these estimates. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management considers the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, peer group information, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential real estate, small commercial real estate, home equity and consumer loans, are evaluated in the aggregate using historical loss factors and peer group data adjusted for current economic conditions. More complex loans, such as commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans, are evaluated individually for impairment, primarily through the evaluation of net operating income and available cash flow and their possible impact on collateral values.
 The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is charged against current period earnings and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge-offs, net of recoveries.
 The provision for loan losses was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses was $12.3 million, or 0.9% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2018, as compared to $10.8 million, or 1.4% of gross loans receivable outstanding at December 31, 2017.  In accordance with acquisition accounting, loans acquired in the Anchor Acquisition were recorded at their estimated fair value, which resulted in a net discount to the contractual amounts of the loans, of which a portion reflects a discount for possible credit losses. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value and as a result no allowance for loan losses is recorded for acquired loans at the acquisition date. Although the discount recorded on the acquired loans is not reflected in the allowance for loan losses, or related allowance coverage ratios, we believe it should be considered when comparing the current ratios to similar ratios in periods prior to the acquisition. The recorded value of loans acquired in the Anchor Acquisition as of November 15, 2018 was $361.6 million, including $1.3 million of purchased credit impaired loans, and the fair value discount was $5.3 million, or 1.5% of the loans acquired.  Management will continue to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and make adjustments to the provision for loan losses based on loan growth, economic conditions, charge-offs and portfolio composition.

 
  23

 

 Assessing the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires making material estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. In the opinion of management, the allowance, when taken as a whole, reflects probable incurred loan losses in the loan portfolio. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 - Provision for Loan Losses” and Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10‑K.

      While management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that

any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of the Bank’s allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the adjustment of reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.
 Investment Activities
 General. Under Washington law, savings banks are permitted to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, banker’s acceptances, repurchase agreements, federal funds (“Fed Funds”), commercial paper, investment grade corporate debt securities, and obligations of states and their political subdivisions.
 The Chief Financial Officer has the responsibility for the management of the Company’s investment portfolio, subject to consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, and the direction and guidance of the Board of Directors. Various factors are considered when making investment decisions, including the marketability, maturity and tax consequences of the proposed investment. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds via deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases.
 The general objectives of the Company’s investment portfolio will be to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, to assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low and to maximize earnings while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk” of this Form 10‑K.
 As a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, the Bank had $9.9 million in stock at December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank received $379,000 in dividends.

 Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds
 General. Deposits, borrowings, and loan repayments are the major sources of funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions. Borrowings from the FHLB of Des Moines are used to supplement the availability of funds from other sources and also as a source of term funds to assist in the management of interest rate risk.
 The Company’s deposit composition reflects a mixture with certificates of deposit accounting for 38.0% of the total deposits at December 31, 2018, and interest and noninterest-bearing checking, savings and 1,000 accounts comprising the balance of total deposits. The Company relies on marketing activities, convenience, customer service and the availability of a broad range of deposit products and services to attract and retain customer deposits. The Company also had $116.7 million of brokered deposits, or 9.2% of total deposits at December 31, 2018.  As a wholesale funding alternative, brokered deposits have competitive rates that are comparable to FHLB borrowings and local certificates of deposit.
 Deposits. Deposits are attracted from within the market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit with a variety of rates. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of the Company’s deposit accounts, the Company considers the development of long term profitable customer relationships, current market interest rates, current maturity structure and deposit mix, customer preferences, and the profitability of acquiring customer deposits compared to alternative sources.
 The following table sets forth total deposit activities for the years indicated.

  The Federal Reserve requires the Bank to maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or noninterest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (“Federal Reserve Bank”). Negotiable order of withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to the reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a savings bank. At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and vault cash exceeded the reserve requirements.
 Debt. Although customer deposits are the primary source of funds for lending and investment activities, the Company uses various borrowings such as advances and warehouse lines of credit from the FHLB of Des Moines, and to a lesser extent Fed Funds purchased to supplement the supply of lendable funds, to meet short-term deposit withdrawal requirements and also to provide longer term funding to better match the duration of selected loan and investment maturities.
 As one of the Company’s capital management strategies, the Company has used advances from the FHLB of Des Moines to fund loan originations in order to increase net interest income. Depending upon the retail banking activity, the Company will consider and may undertake additional leverage strategies within applicable regulatory requirements or restrictions. These borrowings would be expected to primarily consist of FHLB of Des Moines advances.
 As a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB of Des Moines and authorized to apply for advances on the security of that stock and certain mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the U.S. Government) provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met. Advances are individually made under various terms pursuant to several different credit programs, each with its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit. The Bank maintains a committed credit facility with the FHLB of Des Moines that provides for immediately available advances up to an aggregate of $262.9 million at December 31, 2018.  Outstanding advances from the FHLB of Des Moines totaled $137.1 million at December 31, 2018. 
 At December 31, 2018, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings and $127.7 million additional short-term borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank. The Bank also had an aggregate of $51.0 million in unsecured Fed Funds lines of credit with other financial institutions of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2018.
 On October 15, 2015 (the “Closing Date”), FS Bancorp, Inc. closed on a third-party loan commitment by the issuance of an unsecured subordinated term note in the aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million due October 1, 2025 (the “Subordinated Note”). The Subordinated Note bears interest at an annual interest rate of 6.50%, payable by the Company quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on the first such date following the Closing Date and on the maturity date. The Subordinated Note will mature on October 1, 2025 but may be prepaid at the Company’s option and with regulatory approval at any time on or after five years after the Closing Date or at any time upon certain events, such as a change in the regulatory capital treatment of the Subordinated Note or the interest on the Subordinated Note no longer being deductible by the Company for United States federal income tax purposes. The Company contributed $9.0 million of the proceeds from the Subordinated Note as additional capital to the Bank in the

      Subsidiary and Other Activities
 The Company has one active subsidiary, the Bank, and the Bank has one inactive subsidiary. The Bank had no capital investment in its inactive subsidiary at December 31, 2018. Competition
 The Company faces strong competition in attracting deposits. Competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, life insurance companies, mortgage bankers, and more recently, financial technology (or “FinTech”) companies. Other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, finance, and FinTech companies provide vigorous competition in consumer lending, including indirect lending. Commercial business competition is primarily from local commercial banks. The Company competes by delivering high-quality, personal service to customers that result in a high level of customer satisfaction.
 The Company’s market areas have a high concentration of financial institutions, many of which are branches of large money centers and regional banks that have resulted from the consolidation of the banking industry in Washington and other western states. These include such large national lenders as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, and others in the Company’s market area that have greater resources and offer services that the Bank does not provide. For example, the Bank does not offer trust services. Customers who seek “one-stop shopping” may be drawn to institutions that offer services that the Bank does not.
 The Company attracts deposits through the branch office system. Competition for those deposits is principally from other savings institutions, commercial banks and credit unions located in the same community, as well as mutual funds, FinTech companies, and other alternative investments. The Bank competes for these deposits by offering superior service and a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates. Based on the most recent branch deposit data provided by 

 
  32

 
the FDIC, at June 30, 2018, 1st Security Bank of Washington’s share of aggregate deposits in the market area consisting of the seven counties where the Company has branches was less than one percent.
 Employees
 At December 31, 2018, the Company had 424 full-time equivalent employees. Company employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. The Company considers employee relations to be good.
 Set forth below is certain information regarding the executive officers of the Company and the Bank. There are no family relationships among or between the executive officers.

 HOW WE ARE REGULATED
 The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations applicable to FS Bancorp and 1st Security Bank of Washington. Descriptions of laws and regulations here and elsewhere in this Form 10‑K do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress or in the Washington State Legislature that may affect the operations of FS Bancorp and 1st Security Bank of Washington. In addition, the regulations governing the Company and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the FDIC, DFI, Federal Reserve and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. We cannot predict whether any such changes may occur.
 The laws and regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies have changed significantly particularly in connection with the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. However, as an institution with less than $10 billion in assets, 1st Security Bank of Washington is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, supervision and enforcement of its compliance with consumer financial protection laws and regulations is conducted by the FDIC and the DFI.
 Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are to be implemented under regulations promulgated by the federal banking agencies, some of which have not been completed and which in some instances will not take effect for some time, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on 1st Security Bank of Washington, FS Bancorp and the financial services industry more generally.
 In May 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory changes for community banks such as the Bank, and their holding companies.
 The Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of between 8 and 10 percent. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the “community bank leverage ratio” will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules. 
 The Act also expands the category of holding companies that may rely on the “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement” by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion.  The Federal Reserve made this change which became effective on August 30, 2018. In addition, the Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
 It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Act will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the Act and the yet-to-be-written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks.
 Regulation of 1st Security Bank of Washington
 General. 1st Security Bank of Washington, as a state-chartered savings bank, is subject to applicable provisions of Washington law and to regulations and examinations of the DFI. As an insured institution, it also is subject to examination and regulation by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of 1st Security Bank of Washington to the maximum permitted by law. During these state or federal regulatory examinations, the examiners may require 1st Security Bank of 

 
  35

 
Washington to provide for higher general or specific loan loss reserves, which can impact capital and earnings. This regulation of 1st Security Bank of Washington is intended for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders of 1st Security Bank of Washington or FS Bancorp. 1st Security Bank of Washington is required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital and is subject to some limitations on the payment of dividends to FS Bancorp. See below “Regulatory Capital Requirements” and “Restrictions on Dividends and Stock Repurchases.”
 Federal and State Enforcement Authority and Actions. As part of its supervisory authority over Washington-chartered savings banks, the DFI may initiate enforcement proceedings to obtain a consent order to cease-and-desist against an institution believed to have engaged in unsafe and unsound practices or to have violated a law, regulation, or other regulatory limit, including a written agreement. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against insured institutions under its jurisdiction for similar reasons and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. Both these agencies may utilize less formal supervisory tools to address their concerns about the condition, operations or compliance status of a savings bank.
 Regulation by the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions. State law and regulations govern 1st Security Bank of Washington’s ability to take deposits and pay interest, to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make consumer loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking services to its customers, and to establish branch offices. As a state savings bank, 1st Security Bank of Washington must pay semi-annual assessments, examination costs and certain other charges to the DFI.
 Washington law generally provides the same powers for Washington savings banks as federally and other-state chartered savings institutions and banks with branches in Washington, subject to the approval of the DFI. Washington law allows Washington savings banks to charge the maximum interest rates on loans and other extensions of credit to Washington residents which are allowable for a national bank in another state if higher than Washington limits. In addition, the DFI may approve applications by Washington savings banks to engage in an otherwise unauthorized activity, if the DFI determines that the activity is closely related to banking, and 1st Security Bank of Washington is otherwise qualified under the statute. This additional authority, however, is subject to review and approval by the FDIC if the activity is not permissible for national banks.
 Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures deposit accounts in 1st Security Bank of Washington up to $250,000 per separately insured per separately insured deposit ownership right or category. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. The Bank’s deposit insurance premiums for the year ended December 31, 2018, were $517,000. Those premiums have been reduced in recent years due to management’s focus on asset quality, risk management, and growing capital levels.
 The FDIC’s deposit insurance assessments are based on the assessment base for a bank, which is equal to its total average consolidated assets less average tangible capital. Based on the current reserve ratio of the DIF, FDIC assessment rates applicable to 1st  Security Bank range from three basis points to 30 basis points, subject to certain adjustments where applicable for unsecured debt issued by the institution, brokered deposits, and unsecured debt of other FDIC-insured institutions.  Under current regulations, if the reserve ratio becomes equal to, or greater than 2.0% and less than 2.5%, the assessment rates are scheduled to range from two basis points to 28 basis points (subject to adjustments as described above), and further reductions in rates may occur if the reserve ratio increases to 2.5% or more.
 The FDIC conducts examinations of and requires reporting by state non-member banks, such as 1st Security Bank of Washington. The FDIC also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF.  No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment.
 In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation established in 1987 to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. These assessments, which may be revised based upon the level of DIF deposits, will continue until the bonds mature in 2019 through 2021. This payment is assessed quarterly at an annualized rate applied to assessable assets. During 2018, the 

 
  36

 
rate was 3.85%.  The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including 1st Security Bank of Washington, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily under certain circumstances. Management is aware of no existing circumstances which would result in termination of 1st Security Bank of Washington’s deposit insurance.
 A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of 1st Security Bank of Washington. There can be no prediction as to what changes in insurance assessment rates may be made in the future.
 Prompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework for FDIC-insured institutions based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution’s category generally depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures, which include risk-based capital measures, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors. The well capitalized category is described below in “Capital Requirements”. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized.
 Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by 1st Security Bank of Washington to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if unremedied, result in progressively more severe restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements.
 At December 31, 2018, 1st Security Bank of Washington was categorized as well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations of the FDIC. For additional information, see “Capital Requirements” below and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Form 10‑K.
 Capital Requirements. Effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over a number of years), 1st Security Bank of Washington became subject to new capital regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, which created a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, increased the minimum leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, changed the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, required an additional capital conservation buffer over the minimum capital ratios, and changed what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the Dodd Frank Act and the “Basel III” requirements.
 Under the capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) unless an institution elects to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
 In addition to the minimum capital requirements, a capital conservation buffer must be maintained by 1st Security Bank of Washington which consists of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary 

 
  37

 
bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, increasing each year until fully phased in on January 1, 2019.
 To be considered well capitalized, a depository institution must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.00%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.50% and a leverage ratio of at least 5.00% and not be subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which its primary federal banking regulator requires it to maintain a specific capital level.
 At December 31, 2018, 1st Security Bank of Washington met the requirements to be well capitalized and met the fully phased in capital conservation buffer requirement. Management monitors the capital levels of the Bank to provide for current and future business opportunities and to meet regulatory guidelines for well capitalized institutions. The Bank’s actual capital ratios at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are presented in the following tables:

Total risk-based capital | | | | | | | | 
(to risk-weighted assets) | 16.25 | % | 8.00 | % | 9.25 | % | 10.00 | %
Tier 1 risk-based capital | | | | | | | | 
(to risk-weighted assets) | 15.00 | % | 6.00 | % | 7.25 | % | 8.00 | %
Tier 1 leverage capital | | | | | | | | 
(to average assets) | 12.61 | % | 4.00 | % | N/A | | 5.00 | %
CET1 capital | | | | | | | | 
(to risk-weighted assets) | 15.00 | % | 4.50 | % | 5.75 | % | 6.50 | %

      The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution’s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances. Management of 1st Security Bank of Washington believes that, under the current regulations, 1st Security Bank of Washington will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future.
 The FASB has adopted a new accounting standard for U.S. GAAP that will be effective for us for our first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required 

 
  38

 
under CECL.  For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is generally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital.
 The federal banking regulators (the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC) have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital.
 For a complete description of the Bank’s required and actual capital levels on December 31, 2018, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Form 10‑K.
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; loan documentation; credit underwriting; interest rate risk exposure; asset growth; asset quality; earnings; and compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution’s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer, and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. Each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems. If the FDIC determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines, it may require an institution to submit to the FDIC an acceptable plan to achieve compliance.
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. The FHLB of Des Moines is one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of savings institutions. The FHLBs are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The FHLBs are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System and make loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from a FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, members are required to purchase stock equal to 4.0% of advances. That stock may be redeemed if advances are paid down.  See “Business - Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds - Debt.” At December 31, 2018, 1st Security Bank of Washington had $9.9 million in FHLB of Des Moines stock, which was in compliance with this requirement.
 The FHLB pays dividends quarterly, and 1st Security Bank of Washington received $379,000 in dividends during the year ended December 31, 2018.
 The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of 1st Security Bank of Washington’s FHLB stock may result in a decrease in net income.
 Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank’s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance directs the FDIC and other federal bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial 

 
  39

 
real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk:
 Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the Bank’s total regulatory capital; or
 Total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300% or more of the Bank’s total regulatory capital and the outstanding balance of the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months.
 The guidance provides that the strength of an institution’s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy. At December 31, 2018, 1st Security Bank of Washington’s aggregate recorded loan balances for construction, land development and land loans were 131.2% of regulatory capital. In addition, at December 31, 2018, 1st Security Bank of Washington’s loans on all commercial real estate, including construction, owner and non-owner occupied commercial real estate, and multi-family lending, as defined by the FDIC, were 300.0% of regulatory capital.
 Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions. Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (1) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (2) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets, (3) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage or bankers’ blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (4) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met.
 Dividends. Dividends from 1st Security Bank of Washington constitute a major source of funds for dividends in future periods that may be paid by FS Bancorp to shareholders. The amount of dividends payable by 1st Security Bank of Washington to FS Bancorp depends upon the Bank’s earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies. According to Washington law, 1st Security Bank of Washington may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its capital stock if it would cause its net worth to be reduced below (1) the amount required for liquidation accounts or (2) the net worth requirements, if any, imposed by the Director of the DFI. Dividends on 1st Security Bank of Washington’s capital stock may not be paid in an aggregate amount greater than the aggregate retained earnings of 1st Security Bank of Washington, without the approval of the Director of the DFI. The Bank paid $1.4 million in dividends to the holding company in 2018.
 The amount of dividends actually paid during any one period will be strongly affected by 1st Security Bank of Washington’s policy of maintaining a strong capital position. Federal law further limits and can prohibit dividends when an institution does not meet the capital conservation buffer requirement and provides that no insured depository institution may pay a cash dividend if it would cause the institution to be “undercapitalized,” as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments are deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice.
 Affiliate Transactions. FS Bancorp and 1st Security Bank of Washington are separate and distinct legal entities. FS Bancorp (and any non-bank subsidiary of FS Bancorp) is an affiliate of 1st Security Bank of Washington. Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates. Transactions deemed to be “covered transactions” under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and between a bank and an affiliate are limited to 10% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus and, with respect to all affiliates, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank’s capital and surplus. Further, covered transactions that are loans and extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Federal law also requires that covered transactions and certain other transactions listed in Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act between a bank and its affiliates be on terms as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates.

 Community Reinvestment Act. 1st Security Bank of Washington is also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank’s performance under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the Bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency’s assessment of a bank’s record is made available to the public. Further, a bank’s CRA performance rating must be considered in connection with a bank’s application to, among other things, establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution, and in connection with certain applications by a bank holding company, such as bank acquisitions. 1st Security Bank of Washington received a “satisfactory” rating during its most recent CRA examination.
 Privacy Standards. 1st Security Bank of Washington is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. These regulations require 1st Security Bank of Washington to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of its information sharing practices and informing consumers of its rights to opt out of certain practices.
 Environmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on, all prior and present “owners and operators” of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress asked to protect secured creditors by providing that the term “owner and operator” excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this “secured creditor exemption” has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including 1st Security Bank of Washington, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property.
 Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or noninterest-bearing deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. NOW accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to the reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a savings bank. At December 31, 2018, 1st Security Bank of Washington’s deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and vault cash exceeded its reserve requirements.
 Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and empowered it to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. 1st Security Bank of Washington is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less than $10 billion, 1st Security Bank of Washington is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and the DFI with respect to compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations.
 1st Security Bank of Washington is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, and various regulations that implement the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject 1st Security Bank of Washington to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights.

 Regulation and Supervision of FS Bancorp
 General. FS Bancorp is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve and is the sole shareholder of 1st Security Bank of Washington. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and the regulations promulgated there under. This regulation and oversight is generally intended to ensure that FS Bancorp limits its activities to those allowed by law and that it operates in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of 1st Security Bank of Washington.
 As a bank holding company, FS Bancorp is required to file quarterly and annual reports with the Federal Reserve and any additional information required by the Federal Reserve and is subject to regular examinations by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
 The Bank Holding Company Act. Under the BHCA, FS Bancorp is supervised by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks by having the ability to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress to the bank. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve’s regulations or both. No regulations have yet been proposed by the Federal Reserve to implement the source of strength doctrine required by the Dodd-Frank Act. FS Bancorp and any subsidiaries that it may control are considered “affiliates” of 1st Security Bank of Washington within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between 1st Security Bank of Washington and its affiliates are subject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, FS Bancorp and its subsidiaries are prohibited from tying the provision of various services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by FS Bancorp or its subsidiaries.
 Acquisitions. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve may approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company, the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. These activities include:  operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers’ checks, and U.S. Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers.
 Regulatory Capital Requirements. As discussed above, pursuant to the Act, effective August 30, 2018, bank holding companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets were generally no longer subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital regulations, which are generally the same as the capital regulations applicable to 1st Security Bank of Washington. At the time of this change, FS Bancorp was considered “well capitalized” (as defined for a bank holding company), and was not subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which the Federal Reserve requires it to maintain a specific capital level.

 The Company’s regulatory capital amounts and ratios at December 31, 2018 are presented in the following table.

 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | To be Well Capitalized |

      For additional information, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10‑K.
 Interstate Banking. The Federal Reserve may approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than the holding company’s home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. The Federal Reserve may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period, not exceeding five years, specified by the law of the host state. Nor may the Federal Reserve approve an application if the applicant controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United States or 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank’s home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch. Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state that may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30% state-wide concentration limit contained in the federal law.
 The federal banking agencies are generally authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the law of any state.  Interstate acquisitions of branches will be permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above.
 Restrictions on Dividends and Stock Repurchases. FS Bancorp’s ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the Federal Reserve limits and Washington law, and it may depend on its ability to receive dividends received from 1st Security Bank of Washington.
 Federal Reserve policy limits the payment of a cash dividend by a bank holding company if the holding company’s net income for the past year is not sufficient to cover both the cash dividend and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. A bank holding company that does not meet any applicable capital standard would not be able to pay any cash dividends under this policy. A bank holding company not subject to consolidated capital requirements is expected not to pay dividends unless its debt-to-equity ratio is less than 1:1, and it meets certain additional criteria. The Federal Reserve also has indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends.
 Except for a company that meets the applicable standard to be considered a well capitalized and well-managed bank holding company and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, a bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation or regulatory order, condition, or written agreement.

 Under Washington corporate law, FS Bancorp generally may not pay dividends if after that payment it would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business, or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities.
 Federal Securities Law. The stock of FS Bancorp is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a result, FS Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions, and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 FS Bancorp stock held by persons who are affiliates of FS Bancorp may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. Affiliates are generally considered to be officers, directors and principal shareholders. If FS Bancorp meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of FS Bancorp will be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a public company that files periodic reports with the SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, FS Bancorp is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. Our policies and procedures have been updated to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
 The Dodd-Frank Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 imposed new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions, and implements new capital regulations that FS Bancorp and 1st Security Bank of Washington have and will become subject to and that are discussed above under the section entitled “Regulation of 1st Security Bank of Washington - Capital Requirements.”
 In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies like FS Bancorp, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a “say on pay” vote every one, two, or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions, or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) amend Item 402 of Regulation S-K to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer’s annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. For certain of these changes, the implementing regulations have not been promulgated, so the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on public companies cannot be determined at this time.
 TAXATION
 Federal Taxation
 General. FS Bancorp and 1st Security Bank of Washington are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to FS Bancorp. 1st Security Bank of Washington is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2015, and income tax returns have not been audited for the past seven years, 2012 to 2018.  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act amended the Internal Revenue Code to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses. For businesses, the Tax Act reduced the corporate federal income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate. The corporate income tax rate reduction was effective January 1, 2018.
 FS Bancorp files a consolidated federal income tax return with 1st Security Bank of Washington. Accordingly, any cash distributions made by FS Bancorp to its shareholders would be considered to be taxable dividends and not as a non‑taxable return of capital to shareholders for federal and state tax purposes. For additional information, see Note 11 of 

 
  44

 
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10 K.
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, FS Bancorp currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a fiscal year ending on December 31 for filing its federal income tax return.
 Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, called alternative minimum taxable income. The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years.
 Corporate Dividends‑Received Deduction. FS Bancorp may eliminate from its income dividends received from 1st Security Bank of Washington as a wholly owned subsidiary of FS Bancorp if it elects to file a consolidated return with 1st Security Bank of Washington. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 100%, or 80%, in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, depending on the level of stock ownership of the payor of the dividend. Corporations which own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct 70% of dividends received or accrued on their behalf.
 Washington Taxation
 The Company and the Bank are subject to a business and occupation tax which is imposed under Washington law at the rate of 1.50% of gross receipts. Interest received on loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties, residential mortgage-backed securities, and certain U.S. Government and agency securities are not subject to this tax.
