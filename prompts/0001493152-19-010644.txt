Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Unless otherwise provided in this Annual Report, references to the “Company,” “we,” “us”, and “our” refer to Vitality Biopharma, Inc., a Nevada corporation formed on June 29, 2007 and formerly known as Legend Mining Inc. On October 10, 2011, we completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Stevia First Corp., whereby we changed our name from “Legend Mining Inc.” to “Stevia First Corp.” On July 15, 2016, our Board of Directors and shareholders approved a name change to Vitality Biopharma, Inc.
 
Vitality Biopharma is a company focused on the advancement of pharmaceuticals and innovative technologies that improve the lives of patients. We seek to achieve this objective through the development of novel cannabinoid pharmaceutical prodrugs known as cannabosides. We will conduct our operations using our own personnel and facilities, through subsidiaries established to conduct such operations, and through strategic partnerships with promising early stage companies that are bringing innovative products and services to market but lack the necessary capital or resources to fully capitalize on their high growth potential. We may provide assistance to such strategic partners through management assistance, loans of capital or equipment or personnel resources, or other arrangements designed to support the operations of our Company.
 
Our cannabosides are cannabinoid-glycoside prodrugs, which were discovered through application of the Company’s proprietary enzymatic bioprocessing technologies, that are converted within the body after administration from an inactive molecule into a pharmacologically active drug. Currently, the Company has produced more than 25 novel cannabosides, including glycosylated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidivarin (CBDV) and cannabinol (CBN), that are covered by worldwide patent applications for composition of matter, method of production and method of use.
 
As a complementary strategy, the Company plans to leverage its research and managerial expertise to enter into strategic partnerships with early-stage businesses that require capital and resources to drive innovation and bring new medicines, services and technologies to market to advance the health of patients. We plan to focus our energies on companies approaching key value inflection points where our unique capabilities can accelerate growth and provide solutions-oriented strategies to drive better performance and create value for our strategic partners and shareholders.
 
Our corporate headquarters is located in Los Angeles, California. As of July 12, 2019, we employed eight full-time employees, including five research professionals working in our office and laboratory space in Yuba City, California. We also have engaged the services of scientific and regulatory consultants to assist in our research and development activities, which is an approach that provides us with flexible and highly-experienced resources to advance our clinical efforts while maintaining a relatively lower overhead cost structure.
 
Cannaboside Prodrugs
 
A prodrug is a compound that, after administration, is metabolized into a pharmacologically active drug. Prodrugs are often designed to improve drug properties and reduce known or expected toxicities and adverse side effects. By using our proprietary enzymatic bioprocessing technologies, our clinical research team has developed a novel family of prodrugs by combining cannabinoid and glucose molecules. The resulting compounds, known as cannabosides, have unique commercial applications and patentable compositions of matter, which are separate and distinct from ordinary cannabinoids. The advantages of cannabosides may include: (i) administration in a convenient oral formulation, (ii) targeted delivery with release in the colon or large intestine, (iii) improved stability with limited degradation or drug metabolism, and (iv) delayed release enabling longer-lasting effects and fewer administrations by patients.
 
Our proprietary glycosylation process, which results in adding one or more glucose molecules to compounds, may enable our new cannabosides to act as prodrugs that achieve targeted delivery of the bioactive compounds of cannabinoids to the gastrointestinal tract. Glycosylated compounds are generally more stable and are water soluble, so upon ingestion, we believe they will remain intact and transit through the esophagus, stomach and upper intestine with limited absorption or degradation from stomach acids. However, once the glycosylated compounds reach the lower intestine, we expect them to encounter glycoside hydrolase enzymes secreted by the human intestinal microbiota that will cleave the polar glucose residues and release the active cannabinoid compound primarily in the large intestine or colon.

We have focused our research and development activities on the glycosylation of cannabinoids given their well-known positive effects on the human endocannabinoid system. Our research and development activities originally focused on the glycosylation of CBD and then later expanded into the glycosylation of THC. The use of the cannabinoid THC has been shown to provide substantial anti-inflammatory benefits on the human body, among other benefits, but is limited as a pharmaceutical option given its psychoactive and intoxicating properties. However, by glycosylating THC, we have learned through initial animal studies that the binding of glucose and THC molecules restricts the release of THC into the body’s digestive system until the prodrug reaches the large intestine, at which point the glycoside hydrolase enzymes cleave the glucose from the prodrug and the THC is released in a targeted and restricted manner. Further, we have learned through our initial animal studies that this targeted release of THC, which could be provided in very low doses to achieve physiologically beneficial results, serves as an anti-inflammatory agent in the lower gastrointestinal tract and minimizes the amount of THC absorbed into the blood stream, therefore avoiding the psychoactive and intoxicating properties that hinder the broader pharmaceutical use of THC.
 
We are developing our THC-glycoside prodrugs for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) because of the targeted release described previously. IBD is a frequently chronic inflammatory condition where parts of the digestive system become inflamed from an overactive immune response. The disease can lead to irreversible damage to the gastrointestinal tract and may require surgery to remove affected areas of the intestine. Two major forms of the disease are Crohn’s disease, which can affect any part of the digestive system, and ulcerative colitis, which often affects the colon or large intestine. The disease is often unpredictable with periods of painful and debilitating symptoms followed by periods of remission with limited symptoms. IBS has similar symptoms to IBD, including abdominal pain, but the underlying disease process is quite different. IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that commonly affects the large intestine and is characterized by abdominal cramping, diarrhea, constipation, and pain. Currently, patients suffering from IBD are frequently prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids, biologics and immunosuppressants, and patients suffering from IBS are prescribed antibiotics, antidepressants and gastrointestinal motility compounds, all of which often result in unwanted side effects.
 
Our most promising THC-glycoside (VBX-100) is being developed as an oral prodrug for the treatment of IBD and IBS. VBX-100 was selected from our THC-glycoside portfolio for compatibility with commercial production techniques and the optimal prodrug delivery profile that maximizes intestinal anti-inflammatory properties while minimizing psychoactive or intoxicating effects. Initial preclinical studies on the efficacy of VBX-100 in animal models have shown favorable outcomes, including reduced inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and no measurable systemic THC found in tissue examined using highly-sensitive testing equipment. Our preclinical development plan, which includes dose range finding studies, GLP toxicology studies, pharmacokinetic studies and other preclinical research, is anticipated to be completed during the 2nd half of calendar year 2020, subject to the Company securing sufficient additional funding or entering into a strategic partnership. After our satisfactory completion of all of the prerequisite preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application would be filed with the FDA and, upon receiving FDA approval, we would initiate our Phase 1 clinical trial, subject to the Company securing sufficient additional funding or entering into a strategic partnership.
 
In addition to our research and development activities related to our THC-glycoside compounds, we are expanding and diversifying our research and development activities to include the potential safety, efficacy and commercialization of our patented CBD-glycoside compounds. CBD has well-known anti-anxiety, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties, but unlike THC, CBD is non-psychoactive and non-intoxicating. By glycosylating CBD, we can create CBD-glucose compounds that may enable a targeted and concentrated delivery of CBD in the gastrointestinal tract. Currently we are evaluating the optimal CBD-glycoside delivery mechanism, which may include an aqueous drink formulation since our glycosylation process greatly improves the water solubility of the CBD molecule.

Enzymatic Processing Methods
 
The Company originally developed its proprietary enzymatic bioprocessing technologies to attach glucose molecules to the molecules of stevia as part of our activities in the stevia processing industry. We then expanded the application of this proprietary technology to attach glucose molecules to cannabinoids, including THC and CBD. We may pursue additional opportunities to develop new products or license this technology.
Strategic Partnerships
 
As a complement to our capital intensive and longer duration drug development business, we plan to expand and diversify our corporate strategy to include strategic partnerships with promising early-stage companies that are bringing innovative products and services to market but lack the necessary capital or resources to fully realize their high-growth potential. Given the rapid advancements in science and technology, there are many early-stage life science companies that are approaching key value inflection points but lack the necessary managerial expertise, personnel, patents, funding or equipment to advance their efforts or to bring their medicines, services and technologies to market. Our strategy is to opportunistically fill those unmet needs, including funding and, equally important, to provide our strategic partners with the necessary resources and value-added support to help transform and improve their businesses.
 
Strategic partnerships may enable us to expand our network of researchers, clinicians, and medical professionals and provide us with an opportunity to allocate our cash, personnel, equipment, proprietary information and other resources into a diversified collection of assets that strengthen and complement our drug development initiatives. We will target strategic partnerships that provide unique technological or human capital attributes that are well-positioned to provide us with a more diversified cash flow profile that complements our capital-intensive drug development operations.
 
Government Regulation
 
Due to our development of pharmaceutical products, we are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other federal, state, and local agencies. Also, since we are researching and developing cannabinoid-based products, we are subject to regulation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). If we expand our clinical research, product development or commercialization activities outside of the United States in the future, we anticipate that we would then be subject to additional regulation by the applicable foreign jurisdictions and governing bodies, which may have different requirements.
 
The FDA is the main regulatory body that controls pharmaceutical and biologic drugs in the United States, with additional layers of regulation from other federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act governs most of the requirements for the development and marketing of our pharmaceutical products. The FDA’s drug approval process is extensive, generally including: preclinical animal studies of drug safety, efficacy and dosing, submission and approval of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, clinical studies in humans to determine safety, efficacy and dosing (Phases 1 – 3 studies), submission and approval of a New Drug Application (NDA), and additional post-approval requirements. Failure to comply with any FDA-requirements may result in the FDA refusing to approve our application.
 
The DEA establishes procedures and monitors research and development activities of “controlled substances” subject to the Controlled Substances Act. Our research and development activities focus on cannabinoids, particularly THC and CBD, which the DEA has classified as Schedule I substances. Schedule I substances are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. In May 2019, the DEA informed us that it had determined that they consider our VBX-100 prodrug a Schedule I substance. As a result, any developing, testing, manufacturing, or clinical studies involving our VBX-100 prodrug, and by inference potentially all of our THC-glycoside molecules, are required to be properly licensed by the DEA and adhere to strict diversion control standards. Our current research and development efforts involving our THC-glycoside molecules are conducted at our Yuba City laboratory, which holds a DEA-issued Controlled Substance Registration Certificate for “Research” that expires on May 31, 2020 and is renewable on an annual basis. Our research and development activities are also approved by and operated in compliance with the State of California’s Research Advisory Panel, which is a division of the California Department of Justice that oversees research performed within the state using DEA Schedule I and II substances.

Intellectual Property
 
In September 2015, we filed our first provisional U.S. patent application entitled “Cannabinoid Glycoside Prodrugs and Methods of Synthesis”, which described novel CBD-glycosides and THC-glycosides along with methods of production through enzymatic biosynthesis. In October 2015, we filed our second provisional U.S. patent application that added CBDV-glycosides as additional cannabisodes, plus added numerous methods of use claims for our cannabinoid-glycosides. In July 2016, we filed our third provisional U.S. patent application that greatly expanded on the cannabinoid substrates for glycosylation by adding (i) the phytocannabinoid cannabinol (CBN), (ii) the endocannabinoids anandamide, 2-AG, 1-AG, and synaptamide, and (iii) the vanilloids capsaicin, vanillin, and curcumin. In September 2016, one year after the filing of our first provisional patent, our non-provisional cannabinoid glycoside patent was filed, which included all prior material plus additional data derived from our ongoing research and laboratory studies. Also, in September 2016, we filed an expanded international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty system, which included 79 patent claims covering nearly 200 individual compounds, including our THC and CBD prodrugs. In March and April 2018, this application was filed for national and regional prosecution in major pharmaceutical markets worldwide, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Brazil.
 
In May 2017, we filed a U.S. patent application entitled “Antimicrobial Compositions Comprising Cannabinoids and Methods of Using”, which described compositions and methods of use involving cannabinoid-glycosides that provide antimicrobial activity to treat microbial infections in the intestines, including Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infections. In May 2018, one year after the filing of the provisional U.S. patent, we filed a non-provisional U.S. patent for the use of cannabinoid-glycosides to deliver cannabinoids to the gastrointestinal tract to treat C. diff infections.
 
We believe our intellectual property portfolio of cannabinoid-glycosides possess significant value and, as a result, we have allocated substantial resources to ensure that our U.S. and international patents are properly filed and successfully prosecuted. As our research efforts involving cannabinoid-glycosides continue to progress, we plan to develop and file additional patents to cover compositions of matter, methods of production and methods of use to further expand our growing family of intellectual property assets and create long-term value for our shareholders.
 
Competition
 
The Company operates in a highly competitive and dynamic market environment, frequently against much larger and better capitalized competitors. Currently, the Company’s cannabinoid prodrug development program competes against many well-capitalized, multinational pharmaceutical drug manufacturers that are developing, producing and marketing pharmaceutical drugs for the treatment of IBD and IBS. Additionally, an increasing number of cannabinoid drug manufacturers are entering the market with cannabinoid-based drug development programs to treat a wide range of diseases, which could include IBD and IBS. Our expectation is that competition from traditional pharmaceutical drug developers and non-traditional cannabinoid-based drug developers will continue to increase substantially over the next 12 months. Furthermore, the Company’s strategy to secure strategic partnerships with promising early stage companies is likely to experience a substantial amount of competition, particularly from investment companies, debt financing providers, and other alternative sources of capital.
The Control Center
 
In October 2018, Summit Healthtech, Inc. acquired The Control Center, a Beverly Hills addiction clinic owned by Dr. Arif Karim. After that transaction closed, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Summit Healthtech, Inc., through a share exchange transaction. We then changed the name of Summit Healthtech, Inc. to Vitality Healthtech, Inc., which is our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
Vitality Healthtech assembled a team of physicians, psychologists and other medical professionals to provide specialty care services to patients suffering from addiction and dependency issues, with a particular focus on the use of cannabinoids for opiate reduction treatment protocols. Unfortunately, due to the poor financial and operating performance of The Control Center following its acquisition in October 2018, Vitality Healthtech ceased all operations of The Control Center effective June 14, 2019.

On May 31, 2019, Vitality Healthtech terminated its Executive Employment Agreement with Dr. Arif Karim, dated October 12, 2018, whereby Dr. Karim was employed by Vitality Healthtech to serve as its Chief Medical Officer. Vitality Healthtech is currently negotiating a separation agreement with Dr. Karim.
 
On June 13, 2019, Vitality Healthtech timely submitted a notice of claims under the Share Purchase Agreement, dated October 12, 2018, by and among Summit Healthtech, Inc. (n/k/a Vitality Healthtech, Inc.), The Control Center and Dr. Arif Karim. Vitality Healthtech is currently negotiating a settlement of its claims with Dr. Karim.
 
Stock Relisting and Liquidity
 
On November 7, 2018, the SEC temporarily suspended the trading of the Company’s common stock on the OTCQB marketplace. The Company’s common stock resumed trading with limited liquidity on the grey market on November 21, 2018. Grey market stocks are not traded or quoted on an exchange or inter-dealer quotation system, but are reported by broker-dealers to their self-regulatory organization who, in turn, distribute the trade data to market data vendors and financial websites.
 
Since inception, the Company has funded its operations primarily through equity and debt financings. However, it would currently be very challenging for the Company to raise significant capital through an equity financing because of our “grey market” trading status. Therefore, it is critical that the Company resumes trading status on the OTCQB or another national exchange in order to raise additional capital to fund our continued operations. If we cannot resume ordinary course trading status or raise additional capital, then we will be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our operations, including our preclinical prodrug development initiatives for VBX-100.
 
We have made relisting our common stock on the OTCQB or another national exchange a top corporate priority and, as a result, have expended significant resources to accomplish this critically-important goal. Although we cannot determine if and when a relisting would occur, we continue to actively pursue a relisting of our common stock and are fully committed to taking all steps necessary to successfully complete the relisting process and provide our Company with access to new capital through equity financings and higher levels of liquidity for our shareholders.
 
To that end, our Board of Directors, which includes three directors who joined the Board subsequent to the suspension of the Company’s common stock in November 2018, has passed several corporate resolutions to institute stronger protections and safeguards against unscrupulous market participants, specifically addressing undisclosed beneficial owners and stock promotion firms. More specifically, the Board has resolved that any future non-underwritten capital raises would be limited to U.S.-based investors and that the Company will not enter into any marketing or stock promotion arrangements unless, in each case, expressly vetted and approved by the Board. Lastly, we are considering the pursuit of legal actions under Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, against any undisclosed beneficial owners of the Company’s common stock that were involved in the Company’s equity financing in May 2016 to ensure that any short swing profits improperly earned in connection with that equity financing are properly recovered for the benefit of the Company’s shareholders and that the integrity and transparency of our shareholder base is reaffirmed.
 
Employees
 
As of July 12, 2019, we employed eight full-time employees, including five research professionals working in our office and laboratory space in Yuba City, California. We also have engaged the services of scientific and regulatory consultants to assist with our research and development activities, which is an approach that provides us with flexible and highly-experienced resources to advance our clinical efforts while maintaining a relatively lower and variable overhead cost structure.
Properties
 
Our corporate headquarters is a leased office located at 1901 Avenue of the Stars, 2nd Floor, Los Angeles, California 90067. Our office and laboratory space at 5225 Carlson Road, Yuba City, California 95993 requires a lease payment of approximately $2,600 per month under a lease agreement that expires on May 1, 2020. Prior to its closure in June 2019, The Control Center had operated in leased office space located at 8383 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 228, Beverly Hills, California 90211, which requires a lease payment of approximately $11,500 per month, under a lease agreement that expires on February 28, 2021. We believe our current facilities are adequate to support our corporate strategy over the next 12 months.

Organizational History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 29, 2007 as Legend Mining Inc. On October 10, 2011, we completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Stevia First Corp., whereby we changed our name from “Legend Mining Inc.” to “Stevia First Corp.” Also, on October 10, 2011, we effected a seven-for-one forward stock split of authorized, issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital was increased from 75,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 to 525,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001, and issued and outstanding shares increased from 7,350,000 to 51,450,000.
 
On July 15, 2016, the holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock and our Board of Directors approved (i) a corporate name change from Stevia First Corp. to Vitality Biopharma, Inc., (ii) a ten-for-one reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock, and (iii) an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 525,000,000 to 1,000,000,000. These changes became effective on July 20, 2016.
