Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview



Sensus Healthcare, Inc. (together, with its subsidiary, unless the context otherwise indicates, “Sensus,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a medical device company committed to providing highly effective, non-invasive, and cost-effective treatments for both oncological and non-oncological skin conditions. The Company uses a proprietary low-energy X-ray technology known as superficial radiation therapy (“SRT”), which is based on over a decade of dedicated research and development, and has successfully incorporated SRT into a portfolio of treatment devices: the SRT-100TM, SRT-100+TM and SRT-100 VisionTM. To date, SRT technology has been used to effectively and safely treat oncological and non-oncological skin conditions in hundreds of thousands of patients around the world.



On February 25, 2022, the Company sold the assets comprising its SculpturaTM product for $15 million in cash. Additional information regarding this transaction can be found in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 3, 2022.



Our business was organized in 2010 and the Company, incorporated in Delaware, completed its initial public offering in 2016. The Company operates as one segment from its corporate headquarters located in Boca Raton, Florida. For further information see Note 1, Description of the Business, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.



Our Products and Services



SRT is the Company’s core technology. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had installed 686 units in 18 countries, primarily in the United States.



SRT-100



The SRT-100 is a photon x-ray low energy SRT system that provides patients an alternative to surgery for treating non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers and other skin conditions such as keloids. The SRT-100 is especially effective in treating primary lesions that would otherwise be difficult to treat or require extensive surgery involving sensitive areas of the head and neck regions, such as the fold in the nose, eyelids, lips, corner of the mouth, and the lining of the ear, that would otherwise lead to a less than desirable cosmetic outcome. SRT treatment procedures do not require the use of anesthetics and eliminate the need for skin grafting. The Company believes that the SRT-100 provides healthcare providers and patients with a safe, virtually painless, and substantially non-scarring treatment option for non-melanoma skin cancer and other skin conditions, such as keloids. It allows dermatologists to retain non-melanoma skin cancer patients, rather than referring them to specialists, while offering radiation oncologists an alternative to costly linear accelerator–based treatments with a process that is less invasive, more time-efficient, and improves practice economics. Revenue is primarily derived from sales of our SRT-100 product line. The SRT-100 provides the following clinical and functional advantages:

● | Easy touch automatic set-up procedure, including automatic x-ray tube warm-up procedures; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Specially designed control console for medical physicists and service technicians, providing integrated safety and back-up timer controls, automatic system conditioning procedures, calibration, x-ray output verification and system parameters, including last treatment status information; 
● | Advanced patient record management with integrated enterprise workflow management; 
● | Compact mobile design with a small 30” x 30” footprint and unique scissor x-ray tube arm movements, providing a large range of motion for patient access and treatment; and 
● | High reliability and MTBF (“mean time between failures”) performance that provides availability for patients and practitioners and lowers the total cost of ownership.

Other products



Transdermal Infusion (TDI)



TransDermal Infusion® is a Class II FDA cleared biophysical alternative used to infuse high weight molecule modalities into the dermis (skin) for medical and aesthetic purposes without the use of needles. The Company began distributing this product, which is manufactured in Italy, in 2022. The Company distributed 23 systems during 2022.
Lasers



Sensus also distributes laser devices, for the aesthetic dermatology market, which includes applications for hair removal, vascular lesions, acne treatment, epidermal pigment removal (including removal of spots, freckles, and tattoos), skin toning, and skin rejuvenation.
Consumables



The Company sells disposable lead shielding replacements, disposable radiation safety items, such as aprons and eye shields, ultrasound probe film, and disposable applicator tips, which are used to treat various sized lesions and different areas of the body. Additionally, TDI requires the purchase of disposable tips.
Competition



The medical device industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and is significantly affected by new product introductions and market activities of other participants. Current marketed products, and any future products that the Company commercializes, will compete against healthcare providers who use other methods of treatment for the same disease or condition. 



In order to grow its business, Sensus must be able to compete effectively for market acceptance of its products. Key competitive factors include improved outcomes for medical conditions, acceptance by doctors treating non-melanoma skin cancer and keloids, acceptance by the patient community, ease of use and reliability, product price and qualification for reimbursement, technical leadership and superiority, effective marketing and distribution, speed to market, and quality of client service.



Sales and Marketing



The Company’s focus is mainly on two primary markets, private dermatology practices and radiation oncologists in both private and hospital settings. The Company currently employs a multi-tier sales strategy to optimize geographic coverage and focus on its key markets. This multi-tier sales model uses a direct sales force in the U.S., as well as international dealers and distributors. Sensus plans to continue selling and marketing the Company’s products to both the dermatology and radiation oncology markets concurrently.
Dermatology Market



Private dermatology practices in the U.S. represent the point of entry for most non-melanoma skin cancer patients. The Company believes its SRT products offer dermatologists a competitive advantage by allowing them to retain patients for the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer, rather than having to refer them to other professionals. In addition to non-melanoma skin cancers, the Company has had an FDA clearance to treat keloid scars since 2014. The Company’s SRT has been used by over 100 U.S. dermatology practices in the treatment of keloids. Since 2017, it is also being used to treat keloids in China.
Radiation Oncology Market



For licensed radiation oncologists in the U.S., the Company believes its SRT products offer a simpler, faster method of treatment with a better overall patient experience. SRT offers oncologists the ability to free up more expensive radiation equipment, such as linear accelerators, for more complex procedures while providing patients with effective, non-invasive treatment options for non-melanoma skin cancer.
Other Markets



Sensus believes that the plastic surgery and laser aesthetic markets present growth opportunities. With FDA clearance to treat keloids through SRT, plastic surgeons are recognizing the opportunity to be able to provide an effective treatment solution for this benign tumor. Additionally, the Company believes that plastic surgeons view the non-melanoma skin cancer market as a growth opportunity that can supplement their existing services.





3







Manufacturing and Supply



The Company currently uses third parties located in the U.S. to manufacture products. In 2010, the Company entered into a manufacturing agreement with RbM Services, LLC (“RbM”) pursuant to which RbM agreed to manufacture SRT-100 products. Under this agreement, the Company pays a fixed price per unit, subject to annual adjustments due to changes in the cost of materials. The agreement renews for successive one-year periods unless either party notifies the other party in writing, at least 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the agreement, that it will not renew the agreement. The Company or manufacturer may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice.



The Company maintains internal policies, procedures, and supplier management processes designed to ensure that RbM meets applicable quality standards, including FDA and International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, requirements. To date, Sensus has not experienced any difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to meet the demand for our products, and believes manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet global market demand for our products for the foreseeable future.



The Company believes this third-party manufacturing relationship allows us to work with a supplier that has well-developed specific competencies while minimizing our capital investment, controlling costs, and shortening cycle times, all of which has allowed us to compete effectively with our competitors. Sensus also works with other third parties that it believes could be relied upon if we needed to change suppliers.



The Company has a single preferred supplier for the x-ray tubes and other major components used in its products. The Company believes this supplier has superior products; however, products of alternate suppliers would be adequate for Sensus’s products and therefore the Company does not anticipate any material disruptions to the supply of major components if there were a change in suppliers.



Intellectual Property



The Company actively seeks to protect the intellectual property that is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents that cover Sensus’s products. The Company also relies on trademarks to enhance, build, and maintain the integrity of the Sensus brand.



The Company possesses seven issued U.S. and Global patents. The patents relate to technology that is pertinent to the Company.



The following patents were issued between August 2007 and September 2008:

One patent application was pending at December 31, 2022.



The Company also owns six U.S. trademark registrations (expiring from 2025 through 2031).



The Company also relies on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary rights to develop and maintain a competitive position. The Company seeks to protect unpatented proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and others who may have access to this proprietary information. The Company requires all employees to execute invention assignment agreements with respect to inventions arising from their employment.



The Company can provide no assurance that any patents or trademarks will be issued or registered as a result of our pending or future applications for such intellectual property. Even if any such patents or trademarks are ultimately issued or registered, they, or any of the Company’s other intellectual property, may not provide any meaningful protection or competitive advantage. Intellectual property could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed upon, or misappropriated. In addition, third parties have claimed, and in the future may claim, that the Company or customers, licensees, or other parties indemnified by the Company are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.



Government Regulation



Sensus’s business is subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to the protection of the environment, health, and safety. Some of the pertinent laws and regulations have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and regulations and their interpretations are subject to change, and new laws may be enacted. Both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. The Company believes that its business operations and relationships with customers and suppliers are structured to comply with all applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws and regulations differently and assert otherwise. Discussed below are statutes and regulations that are most relevant to the Company’s business. For the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, we incurred approximately $1.3 million in expenses related to regulatory compliance and quality standards.



FDA Regulation of Medical Devices



The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and FDA regulations establish a comprehensive system for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use. Sensus’s medical device products are subject to these regulations, as well as other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The FDA is also responsible for the overall enforcement of quality, regulatory, and statutory requirements governing medical devices.



FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes — Class I, Class II, or Class III — depending on their level of risk and the types of controls that are necessary to assure device safety and effectiveness. The class assignment determines the type of premarketing submission or application, if any, that will be required before marketing in the U.S. The Company’s medical devices are Class II devices under the FDA’s classification system. Class II devices are deemed to present a moderate risk and are devices for which general controls alone are not sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Medical devices in Class II are subject to both general controls and “special controls” — e.g., special labeling, compliance with industry standards, and post market surveillance. Unless exempted, Class II devices typically require FDA clearance before marketing, through the premarket notification (“510(k)”) process, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 807 requirements.



Unless it is exempt from premarket review requirements, a medical device must receive marketing authorization from the FDA prior to being commercially distributed in the U.S. For Class II devices, 510(k) is the most common pathway to obtain market authorization in the US.



510(k) pathway



We have previously received FDA 510(k) clearances for our SRT-100, SRT-100 Vision, and SRT-100+ (Class II) products through the 510(k) pathway due to the requirement for special controls. To date, other available US regulatory pathways have not been appropriate for our developed products and may involve extended review periods.

Ongoing FDA regulation



After a device is entered into commerce in the U.S., regardless of its classification or premarket pathway, numerous additional FDA requirements generally apply. These include:




● | Establishment registration and device listing requirements, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 807; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Quality System Regulation requirements, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of finished devices, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 820; 


● | Labeling requirements, which mandate the inclusion of certain content in device labels and labeling, and which also prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved (i.e., “off-label”) uses; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 803; and 
● | Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers (a) report to the FDA recalls (i.e., corrections or removals) if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health, and (b) keep records of recalls that they determine to be not reportable, all in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 806. 




The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include, but is not limited to, the following sanctions:




● | Issuance of Form 483 observations (also known as “minor non-conformances”) during a facilities inspection; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Untitled letters or warning letters; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; 
● | Consent Decrees, which forces improvements in the quality management system through the use of the federal courts; 
● | Recall or seizure of products; 
● | Operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
● | Refusing 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products; 
● | Withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; and 
● | Criminal prosecution. 




The Company is subject to unannounced establishment inspections by the FDA, as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation of and compliance with applicable state public health regulations. These inspections may include our suppliers’ facilities.

International Regulations



International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, the Company must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with safety and quality regulations. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. The European Union/European Economic Area, or EU/EEA, requires a CE conformity mark in order to market medical devices. The UK, due to Brexit, also requires a separate clearance. Many other countries, such as Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, accept CE or FDA clearance or approval, although others, such as China, Brazil, Canada and Japan, require separate regulatory filings.



In the EU/EEA, existing Sensus devices are required to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC), while any new products placed in the EU/EEA must comply with the EU Medical Device Regulation (2017/745). Compliance with these requirements entitles the Company to affix the CE marking of conformity to our medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EU/EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE marking of conformity, the Company must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directive (existing products) or Medical Device Regulation (new products), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization accredited by a Member State of the EU/EEA to conduct conformity assessments. The Notified Body typically audits and examines the quality system for the manufacture, design, and final inspection of devices before issuing a certification demonstrating compliance with the essential requirements. Based on this certification, we can draw up an EU Declaration of Conformity which allows us to affix the CE mark to our products.



Further, the advertising and promotion of Sensus’s products in the EU/EEA is subject to the laws of individual EEA Member States implementing the EU Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU/EEA Member State laws governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.



The Company has obtained approval to sell our products in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, and Taiwan, and is currently seeking approval in several other countries.



Sales and Marketing Commercial Compliance



Federal anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service paid for under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Possible sanctions for violation of these anti-kickback laws include monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs, and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions.



In addition, federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Off-label promotion has been pursued as a violation of the federal false claims laws. Pursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA based on their medical judgment, we are prohibited from promoting products for such off-label uses. Additionally, the majority of states in which we market our products have similar anti-kickback, false claims, anti-fee splitting, and self-referral laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Violations of these laws may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties.



To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to an unprecedented level of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming. Additionally, if a healthcare company settles an investigation with the DOJ or other law enforcement agencies, the company may be required to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement.



U.S. and foreign government regulators have increased regulation, enforcement, inspections, and governmental investigations of the medical device industry, including increased U.S. government oversight and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Whenever a governmental authority concludes that a company is not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, that authority can impose fines, delay or suspend regulatory clearances, institute proceedings to detain or seize the company’s products, issue a recall, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations, assess civil penalties against the company, or its officers or employees, and recommend criminal prosecution. Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of devices the company distributes.

Additionally, the commercial compliance environment is continually evolving in the healthcare industry as some states, including California, Massachusetts and Vermont, mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians. The Affordable Care Act also imposes reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. Device manufacturers are also required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements. The Company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance, including in connection with sales and marketing activities.



Healthcare Fraud and Abuse



Healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to Sensus’s business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or most other federally funded healthcare programs. The federal anti-kickback statute (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”) prohibits unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally funded healthcare programs, such as remuneration provided to physicians to induce them to use certain tissue products or medical devices reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. For example, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consultant arrangements with physicians. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Further, recently enacted amendments to the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amend the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of false claims statutes. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid. In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal physician self-referral statute, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits physicians who have a financial relationship with an entity, including an investment, ownership, or compensation relationship, from referring Medicare patients for designated health services, which include clinical pathology services, unless an exception applies. Similarly, entities may not bill Medicare or any other party for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all third-party payors, not just Medicare and Medicaid. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with the Stark Law or state self-referral laws and regulations, our business could be subject to severe financial consequences, including the obligation to refund amounts billed to third-party payors in violation of such laws, civil penalties, and potentially exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The Stark Law often is enforced through lawsuits brought under the Federal False Claims Act, violations of which trigger significant monetary penalties and treble damages.



Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers and suppliers throughout the country for a wide variety of Medicare billing practices, obtaining multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements in addition to individual criminal convictions. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and suppliers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws. The Company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with applicable regulations designed to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse.

Health Information Privacy



The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under HITECH, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities and their business associates, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and security of protected health information.



The Company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, as required by law. The privacy and security regulations establish a “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we are required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the Company must comply with the laws of those other countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict the ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment, or healthcare operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. If the Company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information, it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties, or criminal sanctions. In addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. The Company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. If the Company were to experience a breach of protected health information, it could be subject to significant adverse publicity in addition to possible enforcement sanctions and civil damages lawsuits. Finally, the Company may be required to incur additional costs related to ongoing HIPAA compliance as may be necessary to address evolving interpretations and enforcement of HIPAA and other health information privacy and security laws, the enactment of new laws or regulations, emerging cybersecurity threats, and other factors.



Research and Development



Research and development costs related to development and quality and regulatory costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred research and development expenses of approximately $3.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively. The Company expects research and development expenses in 2023 to be generally consistent with 2022.
Employees and Human Capital



At December 31, 2022, the Company had 42 employees. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.



The Company believes that its success depends on the ability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel. It also believes that the skills, experience, and industry knowledge of its key employees significantly benefits its operations and performance. The Company believes that it offers competitive compensation and other means of attracting and retaining key personnel.



Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
