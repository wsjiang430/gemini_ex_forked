Secure, Online & Remote Voting

Since the launch of Vote YourChoice (™) - Secure Online and Remote Voting Application in June 2020, we have seen significant acceptance and demand for our service. To date, we have signed up a number of new public sector unions, deployed online & remote voting for a number of new and existing union clients and are planning the launch into new markets outside of our current union customer base.

Vote YourChoice™ - Secure Online and Remote Voting

Vote YourChoice™ fulfils the need for an ever-growing demand of online and remote voting requirements for all types of public and private elections. This requirement is now, more than ever, a fundamental change in the way people are able to cast their ballot and maintain physical distancing requirements. This remote ability is also estimated to increase voter participation by 18% to 35%. Vote YourChoice(™) software includes union elections and voting, condominium corporation voting, publicly traded company voting, municipal and provincial elections to name but a few applications globally.
Voting Integrity

Secure, cost-effective and integrated with all organizations requirements. Organizations stakeholders are assured that their votes are processed by a neutral third party and in a transparent manner due in part to our unique voter-verified audit trail. Organizations can also count on our support team as a virtual part of its elections staff.

Through the deployment of the Company’s Distributed Ledger Technology “Blockchain” solution, DLT aims to leverage our offerings adding benefits previously unattainable in the marketplace.

Distributed Ledger Technology “Blockchain”

Distributed Ledger Technology “Blockchain” permits trust to be intrinsically embedded into a technological solution, enabling smooth partnerships and transactions dramatically reducing friction between stakeholders. Our first commercial application launch is expected to be in the online and remote voting application space, leveraging the Company’s own Vote Your Choice(™) voting application deployed to its Canadian Clients. These clients are primarily private and public sector unions.

Blockchain benefits to clients and stakeholders:

Workflow Automation

Distributed Ledger Technology “Blockchain” enabled trust improves coordination between various partners, due to a shared view of transactions and liabilities. This in turn permits the elimination of third parties, resulting in cost savings.
Audit Trail

Facilitates a single view of data instead of the need for consolidation across various disparate systems that results in reliable audit trails due to the history of all transactions being available in the ledger.
Data Privacy

Provable privacy protects clients’ data from being visible to unauthorized parties in compliance with all of today's HIPPA requirements.

Revenue Assurance

Implementation of smart contracts allows for near-instantaneous charging, thus leading to improved revenue assurance and fraud reduction.

Health Information Exchange

DLT Resolution owns RecordsBank.org, a Centralized System for Patients, Lawyers & Insurers to retrieve and access Medical Records. The centralized system and portal is a cloud-based PIPEDA & HIPAA compliant network of Providers and Record Requestors. Utilizing a secure platform, providers will be able to securely exchange records electronically with third-party requestors. Health care providers with proper authorization can also share records with each other. The system works on a fee per record basis with future plans of licensing medical data, stripped of identifiers for medical research.
