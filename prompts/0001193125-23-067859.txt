ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Corporate Information 
 Salem Media Group, Inc. is a domestic multimedia company specializing in Christian and conservative content, with media properties comprising radio broadcasting, digital media, and publishing. Our content is intended for audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and conservative news talk. Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are available free of charge under the Investor Relations section of our website at www.salemmedia.com as soon as reasonably practical after electronically filed. Any information found on our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference into this annual report or any other report of Salem filed with or furnished to the SEC. 
 We have three operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of senior executives, assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and may make changes as necessary. 
 We measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that do not include allocations of costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury, which are reported as unallocated corporate expenses in our consolidated statements of operations included in this annual report. We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes, and interest expense when evaluating the performance of our operating segments. 
 Business Strategy 
 We are fundamentally committed to programming and content emphasizing Christian values, family themes, and conservative news. Our commitment to these values means that we may choose not to switch to other formats or pursue potentially more profitable business opportunities in response to changes in audience preferences. We pursue expansion opportunities for our integrated media platform while aggressively managing operating costs and cash flows to be a market leader for audiences, programmers, and advertisers in the religious and conservative media space. 
 Our goal is to produce and deliver compelling content to audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and conservative news talk. The means by which we deliver this content continues to evolve as new forms of content consumption emerge and grow in popularity. Our integrated multimedia platform includes traditional media, such as radio broadcasting and book publishing, and emerging forms of media including podcasts, mobile applications, websites, and digital publications. 
 We continue to invest in and build websites, launch mobile and tablet applications, increase the strength and reach of our broadcast signals, promote our authors and on-air talent, and increase distribution and page views for our content. Our presence in each of these mediums provides advertisers and programmers with a powerful and integrated platform to reach audiences throughout the United States without compromising the sense of community involvement and branding that we generate through local events and promotions. Our recent expansion efforts included investing in an entity formed for the purpose of developing, producing, and distributing a documentary motion picture. 
 Broadcasting 
 Our foundational business is the ownership and operation of radio stations in large metropolitan markets. We assemble market clusters, or multiple radio stations operating within the same geographic market, to achieve 
 
2 


  operational efficiencies. Several benefits are achievable when operating market clusters. First, we offer advertisers and programmers access to multiple audiences through airtime on each radio station in that market. Second, we realize cost and operating efficiencies by consolidating sales, technical and administrative support, promotional functions, and other shared overhead costs, such as facilities and rent, when possible. Third, additional radio stations in existing markets allows us to leverage our hands-on knowledge of that market to increase our appeal to new audiences and advertisers. 
 We create and distribute programming content though our radio stations, our networks, and our broadcast digital operations that feature many of our national and local on-air hosts. Through Salem Surround, our full-service multimedia marketing agency, we provide state-of-the-art broadcast and digital marketing services to our customers. We also produce and deliver programming through the Salem Podcast Network (“SPN”), Salem News Channel (“SNC”), and OTT television network, and SalemNOW, an online destination with a wide variety of on-demand conservative and faith-based films. Through our Salem Influencer Network, we offer social media campaigns through influencers with highly engaged followers that see them as friends and count on them for trusted advice on a variety of topics. 
 Digital Media 
 The Internet, smartphones and tablets continue to change the way in which content and advertisements are delivered to audiences. Continual advancements with online search engines, social media and mobile applications provide consumers with numerous methods to locate specific content and information online. Digital media allows us to effectively deliver our content and to provide strategic marketing services to our customers. Our editorial staff, including our on-air personalities, provide digital commentaries, programs, text, audio, and video content that we believe to be knowledge-based, credible and reliable. We make strategic decisions to invest in website development, mobile applications and tablet applications given the ongoing shift in consumer demand. We continually seek opportunities to diversify our digital traffic sources to avoid reliance on any one provider. We offer custom digital product offerings, including tools for metasearch, retargeting, website design, reputation management, online listing services, and social media marketing. We also publish digital newsletters that provide market analysis and investment strategies for individual subscribers. 
Publishing 
 We publish books and eBooks for audiences interested in Christian, family-themed, and conservative content and opinion. Our strategy to attract highly sought-after authors and high-profile Christian commentators expands our presence in the conservative and Christian media market and increases the likelihood of publishing books that appear on the best-seller lists. 
Equity Method Investment 
 We invested in OnePartyAmerica LLC (“OPA”), an entity formed for the purpose of developing, producing, and distributing a documentary motion picture. We accounted for our investment in OPA in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 323-30, Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures as described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report. The documentary motion picture, 2000 Mules, was released in May 2022. After the theatrical release, the movie was made available through SalemNOW and other digital streaming services. 
 Seasonality 
 Our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. As is typical in the broadcasting industry, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue typically exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. Seasonal fluctuations in advertising revenue correspond with quarterly fluctuations in the retail industry. Additionally, we 
 
3 


  experience increased demand for political advertising during election even numbered years, over non-election odd numbered years. Political advertising revenue varies based on the number and type of candidates as well as the number and type of contested issues. We also experience fluctuations in quarter-over-quarter comparisons based on the date on which the Easter holiday is observed, as this holiday generates a higher volume of downloads from our church products websites. 
 Audience Growth 
 Our success depends on our ability to reach a growing audience. We seek audience growth opportunities by increasing the strength and number of our broadcast signals, increasing product offerings through digital marketing services, creating and distributing content through SPN and SNC, increasing the number of page-views through our digital media platforms, increasing book sales, and increasing the subscriber base for our digital content. 
 Our audience growth is also contingent upon the desirability of our content to our audience. We produce and provide content that we believe is both compelling and of high commercial value. We rely on a combination of research, market testing and our understanding of our audience to target promotions and events that create visibility and brand awareness in each of our local markets. For maximum results, we cross-promote our content on each of our media platforms. By maximizing our audience share, we can achieve growth in ratings, growth in page views and growth in subscribers that we believe can be converted into revenue from programmers and advertisers that are interested in reaching our audience. 
 Media Strategists 
 We have assembled an effective, highly trained sales staff that is responsible for converting our audience into revenue. Media strategists are trained to provide integrated marketing strategies that include all of our media platforms and our full-service multimedia marketing agency. We operate a focused, sales-oriented culture that rewards selling efforts through a commission and bonus compensation structure. Our media strategists create custom advertising campaigns and provide comprehensive solutions to our clients. Campaigns may include specific geographic coverage areas, event sponsorships, special promotions, e-mail sponsorships, print advertisements, and various digital media elements, including banner advertisements, site retargeting, search engine marketing, tools for metasearch, website design, reputation management, online listing services, and social media marketing. 
Significant Community Involvement 
 We expect our public image to reflect the lifestyle and viewpoints of the target demographic groups that we serve. We regularly collaborate with organizations that serve Christian, conservative, and family-themed audiences as well as sponsor and support events that are important to these groups. We believe that our ongoing active involvement and our strong relationships within Christian and conservative communities provide us with a unique competitive advantage that significantly improves the marketability of our media platform to advertisers and programmers targeting such communities. We produce and sponsor a number of local events that we believe are important in building our brand identity. Our sponsored events include listener rallies, speaking tours, pastor appreciation events and concerts such as our Fishfest® concerts. Local events such as these connect us with our audience and enable us to create an enhanced awareness and name recognition in each of our markets. We believe that this brand awareness creates loyalty with our audience and helps maximize our audience share and ratings over time. 
Corporate Structure 
 Management of our operations is largely decentralized with regional vice presidents and general managers located throughout the United States. We believe that this decentralization encourages each general manager and vice president to apply innovative techniques for improving and growing their operations locally in ways that may become transferable to benefit other markets and operations. 
 
4 


 Our broadcast regional vice presidents, some of whom are also station general managers, are experienced radio broadcasters with expertise in sales, programming, marketing, and production. Each of our broadcast regional vice presidents oversees several markets on a regional basis. Our digital and publishing operations vice presidents and general managers are also located throughout the United States at various locations in which we operate. 
 All our locations receive executive leadership and oversight from our corporate staff. Corporate staff members have experience and expertise in, among other things, accounting and finance, treasury, risk management, insurance, information technology, human resources, legal, engineering, real estate, strategic direction, and other support functions designed to provide resources to local management. Corporate staff also oversee the placement and rate negotiations for national block programming on our stations. Centralized oversight of national programming is necessary because many of our key programming partners purchase time in multiple radio markets. 
 Environmental Compliance 
 Our business activities as a media company and content provider have minimal environmental risks, however, we recognize the importance of protecting the environment. As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, we are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance, however, that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations will not require us to make significant expenditures of funds. 
 Prior to our ownership or operation of our facilities, substances or waste that are, or might be considered, hazardous under applicable environmental laws may have been generated, used, stored, or disposed of at certain of those facilities. In addition, environmental conditions relating to the soil and groundwater at or under our facilities may be affected by the proximity of nearby properties that have generated, used, stored, or disposed of hazardous substances. As a result, it is possible that we could become subject to environmental liabilities in the future in connection with these facilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with such environmental requirements and have not in the past been required to incur significant costs in connection therewith, there can be no assurance that our costs to comply with such requirements will not increase in the future or that we will not become subject to new governmental regulations, including those pertaining to potential climate change legislation that may impose additional restrictions or costs on us. We believe that none of our properties have any environmental condition that is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
 Human Capital 
 As of February 10, 2023, we employed 1,436 total employees of which 1,147 were full time and 289 were part time. These employees consist of 975 in broadcasting, 172 in digital media, 96 in publishing, and 193 corporate employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The average tenure for all of our employees is 8 years. 
 We employ on-air personalities and may enter into employment agreements with these on-air personalities in order to protect our interests in these relationships. However, on-air talent may be lost to competitors for a variety of reasons. While we do not believe that the loss of any one of our on-air personalities would adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations, the loss of several key on-air personalities combined could adversely affect our business. 
 The loss of any of our senior management team could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. Our continued success depends on contributions from our employees and senior management team. Effective succession planning is also important for our long-term success.

 Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic 
 During 2020, we implemented several measures to reduce costs and conserve cash to ensure that we had adequate liquidity to meet our debt servicing requirements. As the economy began to show signs of recovery, we reversed several of these cost reduction initiatives during 2021. We continue to operate with lower staffing levels where appropriate, we have not declared or paid dividends or equity distributions on our common stock since December 2019, and the company 401(k) match was not reinstated until January 2022. 
 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) provided emergency economic assistance for individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including opportunities for additional liquidity, loan guarantees, and other government programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (“CAA”) included a second relief package, which, among other things, provides for an extension of the Payroll Support Program established by the CARES Act. We utilized certain benefits of the CARES Act and the CAA, including: 
 

• | We deferred $3.3 million of employer FICA taxes from April 2020 through December 2020, of which approximately 50% was paid in December 2021 and the remainder was paid in December 2022;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A relaxation of interest expense deduction limitation for income tax purposes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We received Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans of $11.2 million in total during the first quarter of 2021 through the Small Business Association (“SBA”) based on the eligibility as determined on a per-location basis; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In July 2021, the SBA forgave all but $20,000 of the PPP loans, with the remaining PPP loan repaid in July 2021.

Recent Developments 
 On September 26, 2022, we entered into a settlement agreement in connection with a lawsuit. While we denied the allegations made in the lawsuit, we believed that settling the matter was preferable to protracted and costly litigation. During mediation the parties reached a settlement whereby we paid $5.3 million of cash in December 2022, in exchange for a release by the plaintiff of all claims. 
 We invested in OPA, an entity formed for the purpose of developing, producing, and distributing a documentary motion picture. The documentary motion picture, 2000 Mules, was released in May 2022. We recorded $4.1 million of earnings from our equity investment in OPA during the year ended December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, $0.1 million is included in other receivables in our Consolidated Balance sheet representing our share of profit from the documentary motion picture due from OPA. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we completed or entered into the following transactions:

 On December 2, 2022, we acquired radio station KKOL-AM in Seattle, Washington for $0.5 million in cash. We paid $0.4 million of cash at closing and $0.1 million paid from an escrow account. We have been operating the station under a Local Marketing Agreement (“LMA”) since June 7, 2021. 
 On October 1, 2022, we acquired websites and the related assets of DayTradeSPY, a financial publication, for $0.6 million in cash.

 On May 2, 2022, we acquired websites and the related assets of Retirement Media for $0.2 million in cash.

 Divestitures 
 On June 27, 2022, we sold 9.3 acres of land in the Denver, Colorado area for $8.2 million in cash resulting in a pre-tax gain of $6.5 million.

 On May 25, 2022, we sold radio stations WFIA-AM, WFIA-FM and WGTK-AM in Louisville, Kentucky for $4.0 million with credits applied from amounts previously paid, including a portion of the monthly fees paid under a TBA. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.5 million in connection with this sale. 
 On January 10, 2022, we closed on the sale of 4.5 acres of land in Phoenix, Arizona for $2.0 million in cash.

We recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.8 million on the sale and had access to the land for 90-days to relocate our transmitter equipment for KXXT-AM. We continue to operate radio station KXXT-AM with a similar broadcast signal. 
 Pending Transactions 
 On December 20, 2022, we entered an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) to acquire the George Gilder Report and other digital newsletters and related website assets. We assumed the deferred subscription liabilities, resulting in us paying no cash at the time of closing on February 1, 2023. The purchase price is 25% of net revenue generated from sales of most Eagle Financial products during the one-year period after closing to people who are on George Gilder subscriber lists that are not already on Eagle Financial lists.
 On September 29, 2022, we entered into an APA to acquire radio station WMYM-AM and an FM translator in Miami, Florida for $5.0 million. We paid $0.3 million of cash into an escrow account and began 
 
7 


  operating the radio station under a TBA beginning on November 16, 2022. The APA was amended for Salem to acquire only the radio station and translator for $3.2 million, a related party to acquire the land directly from the seller for $1.8 million, and Salem to have an option to purchase the land from the related party pursuant to an option to purchase real estate agreement. The acquisition closed on January 6, 2023. Salem’s executive officers, who have no relationship with the related party, began negotiations for the related party lease agreements and option agreements, subject to final approval by Salem’s Audit Committee pursuant to its related party transaction policy. The option to purchase real estate agreement was approved by Salem’s Audit Committee on March 1, 2023. 
 On September 22, 2022, we entered into an APA to acquire radio stations WWFE-AM, WRHC-AM and two FM translators in Miami, Florida for $5.0 million.

The acquisition closed on January 10, 2023. Salem’s executive officers, who have no relationship with the related party, began negotiations for the related party lease agreements and option agreements, subject to final approval by Salem’s Audit Committee pursuant to its related party transaction policy. The option to purchase real estate agreement was approved by Salem’s Audit Committee on March 1, 2023. 
 In June 2022 we entered into agreements to sell radio stations KLFE-AM and KNTS-AM in Seattle, Washington for $0.7 million subject to approval of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC.”) Radio station KLFE-AM is being programmed by the buyer under a TBA since August 1, 2022. 
 Broadcasting
Our broadcasting segment includes the operating results of our radio stations, networks, podcasts, news channels, video-on-demand, and our national sales agencies including Salem Surround, our full-service multimedia agency. National companies often prefer to advertise across the United States as an efficient and cost-effective way to reach their target audiences. Our national platform under which we offer radio airtime and digital campaigns can benefit national companies by reaching audiences throughout the United States. 
Radio Stations 
 As of the date of this annual report, we own and/or operate 103 radio stations in 36 markets, including 63 radio stations in 23 of the top 25 markets in the United States, consisting of 33 FM radio stations and 70 AM radio stations. We also program the Family Talk® Christian-themed talk format station on SiriusXM Channel 131. We are one of only three commercial radio broadcasters with radio stations in all the top 25 U.S. markets. We are the third largest commercial radio broadcaster in the United States as measured by number of radio stations and the third largest operator as measured by number of stations in the top 25 U.S. markets. 
 We program our radio stations in three main formats: (1) Christian Teaching and Talk, (2) News Talk and (3) Contemporary Christian Music (“CCM”). Other radio station formats include Spanish language Christian Teaching and Talk, Business, Country, Urban, and Classic Hits. 
 Christian Teaching and Talk. We currently program 39 of our radio stations in our foundational format, Christian Teaching and Talk, which is talk programming emphasizing Christian and family themes. Through this format, a listener can hear Bible teachings and sermons, as well as gain insight to questions related to daily life, such as raising children or religious legal rights in education and in the workplace. This format uses block programming time to offer a learning resource and a source of personal support for listeners. Listeners often contact our programmers to donate to their organizations, ask questions and obtain materials on a subject matter or receive study guides based on what they have learned on the radio. 
 Block Programming. We recognize revenue from the sale of blocks of airtime to program producers that typically consist of 121/2, 25 or 50-minutes of time. We sell blocks of airtime on our Christian Teaching 
 
8 


  and Talk format stations to a variety of national and local religious and charitable organizations that we believe create compelling radio programs. National programmers, such as established non-profit religious and educational organizations, typically purchase time on a Monday through Friday basis with supplemental programming blocks available for weekend release. Local programmers, such as community churches and organizations, typically purchase blocks for weekend releases. Historically, more than 95% of these national religious and charitable organizations renew their annual programming relationships with us. Based on our historical renewal rates, we believe that block programming provides a steady and consistent source of revenue and cash flows. Our top ten programmers have remained relatively constant and average more than 30 years on-air with us. Over the last five years, block-programming has generated 38% to 42% of our total net broadcast revenue. 
 Satellite Radio. We program SiriusXM Channel 131, the exclusive Christian Teaching and Talk channel on SiriusXM, reaching the entire nation 24 hours a day, seven days a week.   News Talk. We currently program 32 of our radio stations in a News Talk format. Our research shows that our News Talk format is highly complementary to our core Christian Teaching and Talk format. As programmed by Salem, both formats express conservative views and family values. Our News Talk format allows us to leverage syndicated talk programming produced by Salem Radio NetworkTM (“SRNTM”) to radio stations throughout the United States. Syndication of our programs allows us to reach audiences in markets in which we do not own or operate radio stations. 
 Contemporary Christian Music. We currently program 12 of our radio stations in a Contemporary Christian Music (“CCM”) format, branded The FISH® in most markets. Through the CCM format, we bring listeners the words of inspirational recording artists, set to upbeat contemporary Christian music. Our music format is branded “Safe for the Whole Family”, and features sounds and lyrics for listeners of all ages to enjoy and appreciate.

 Broadcast revenue includes radio advertising spots, programming revenue, digital revenue from each of our radio station websites, digital email blasts, Salem Surround revenue, event revenue, and network advertising revenue. The principal source of network broadcast revenue is from the sale of spot advertising time. Salem Consumer Products, our e-commerce site, generates broadcast revenue from the sale of host content materials. 
 We recognize advertising revenue from radio stations as the spots air or are delivered. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we derived 20.9% of our net broadcast revenue, or $43.0 million, from the sale of local spot advertising and 7.5% of our net broadcast revenue, or $15.4 million, from the sale of national spot advertising. 
 We recognize programming revenue as the programs air. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we derived 26.1% of our net broadcast revenue from the sale of national time and 12.1% of our net broadcast revenue from the sale of local time, or $53.5 million and $24.9 million, respectively. National program revenue is primarily generated from geographically diverse, well-established non-profit religious and educational organizations that purchase time on our stations in a large number of markets in the United States. National program producers typically purchase 121/2, 25 or 50-minute blocks of time on a Monday through Friday basis and may offer supplemental programming for weekend release. We generate local program revenue from community organizations and churches that typically purchase blocks for weekend releases and from local speakers who generally purchase daily releases. Our strategy is to identify and assist quality local programs to expand into national syndication.

 Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive broadcast and media business. We compete for audiences, advertisers, and programmers with other radio broadcasters, broadcast and cable television operators, newspapers and magazines, book publishers, national and local digital services, outdoor advertisers, direct mail services, online marketing and media companies, social media platforms, web-based blogs, and mobile devices. 
 BROADCASTING. Our broadcast audience ratings and market shares are subject to change, and any change in a particular market could adversely affect the revenue of our stations located in that market. While we already compete in some of our markets with stations that offer similar formats, if another radio station were to convert its programming to a format similar to one of ours, or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations, our stations could suffer reduced ratings and/or reduced revenue. In these circumstances, we could also incur significantly higher promotional and other related expenses. We cannot assure that our stations will maintain or increase their current audience ratings and revenue. 
 We compete for advertising revenue with other commercial religious and conservative format stations as well as general format radio stations. Our competition for advertising dollars includes other radio stations as well as digital websites and social media, broadcast television, cable television, newspapers, magazines, direct mail and billboard advertising, some of which may be controlled by horizontally integrated companies. Several factors can materially affect competitive advantage, including, but not limited to, audience ratings, program content, management talent and expertise, sales talent and experience, audience characteristics, signal strength, and the number and characteristics of other radio stations in the same market. 
 Christian and Family-Themed Radio. The broadcast segment that focuses on Christian and family themes is also highly competitive. The financial success of each of our radio stations that focuses on Christian Teaching and Talk is dependent, to a significant degree, upon its ability to generate revenue from the sale of block program time to national and local religious and educational organizations. We compete for this program revenue with a number of different commercial and non-commercial radio station licensees. While we believe that no commercial group owner in the United States specializing in Christian and family-themed programming approaches Salem in size of potential listening audience and presence in major markets, other religious radio stations exist and enjoy varying degrees of prominence and success in some of our markets. 
 New Methods of Content Delivery. Competition from new media technologies and services continues to evolve. Content delivery includes audio programming by cable television and satellite systems, digital audio services, mobile devices including smart phone applications for iPhone® and Android®, personal communications services, social media, and the service of low powered, limited coverage FM radio stations authorized by the FCC. The delivery of live and stored audio programming through the Internet creates new forms of competition. In addition, satellite delivered digital audio radio, which delivers multiple audio programming formats to national audiences, creates competition. We address these existing and potential competitive threats through an active strategy to acquire and integrate new electronic communications formats including digital acquisitions, the launch of Salem Surround, and our exclusive arrangement to provide Christian and family-themed talk on SiriusXM, which is the largest satellite digital audio radio service in the U.S. 
 
17 


 NETWORK. SRNTM competes with other commercial radio networks that offer news and talk programming to religious and general format stations and noncommercial networks that offer Christian music formats. SRNTM also competes with other radio networks for the services of talk show personalities. 
 DIGITAL MEDIA. SWN and Townhall Media compete for visitors and advertisers with other companies that deliver online audio programming, that deliver Christian and conservative digital content, as well as provide general market websites and social media. The online media and distribution business changes quickly and is highly competitive. We compete to attract and maintain interactions with advertisers, consumers, content creators and web publishers. Salem Church Products competes for customers with other online sites that offer resources useful in ministries, preaching, teaching, and for employment within the Christian community. 
 PUBLISHING. Regnery® Publishing competes with other book publishers for readers and book sales as well as on criteria such as product quality, customer service, suitability of format and subject matter, author reputation, price, timely availability of both new titles and revisions of existing books, digital availability of published products, and timely delivery of products to customers. Salem Author Services competes for authors with other on-demand publishers including those focused exclusively on Christian book publishers. 
 Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting 
 Introduction. The ownership, operation, and sale of broadcast stations, including those licensed to Salem, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under authority derived from The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (“Communications Act”). Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for broadcasting; determines whether to approve certain changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates transmission facilities, including power employed, antenna and tower heights, and location of transmission facilities; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of stations; and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules under the Communications Act. 
 The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of specific FCC regulations and policies. Failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures, the grant of “short” (less than the maximum) license renewal terms or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of a license or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties. For further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations you should refer to the Communications Act, FCC rules and the public notices and rulings of the FCC. 
 License Grant and Renewal. Radio broadcast licenses are granted for maximum terms of eight years. Licenses must be renewed through an application to the FCC. Under the Communications Act, the FCC will renew a broadcast license if it finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience, and necessity, that there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC, and that there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC that, when taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. 
 From time to time, the renewal of certain licenses may be delayed. We continue to operate these radio stations under their existing licenses until the licenses are renewed. The affected stations are authorized to continue operations until the FCC acts upon the renewal applications. We continually monitor our stations’ compliance with the various regulatory requirements that are necessary for the FCC renewal. Each of our broadcast licenses was successfully renewed as part of the FCC’s most recent radio renewal cycle, which is now concluded. 
 Petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by certain interested parties, including members of the public in a station’s market. Such petitions may raise various issues before the FCC. The FCC is required to hold hearings on renewal applications if the FCC is unable to determine that renewal of a license would serve the public 
 
18 


  interest, convenience, and necessity, or if a petition to deny raises a “substantial and material question of fact” as to whether the grant of the renewal application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity. In addition, during certain periods when a renewal application is pending, the transferability of the applicant’s license is restricted. 
 The following table sets forth information with respect to each of our radio stations for which we hold the license as of the date of this annual report. Stations that we operate under an LMA or TBA are not reflected on this table. A broadcast station’s market may be different from its community of license. The coverage of an AM radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio station’s transmitter, less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments. For FM radio stations, signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the Effective Radiated Power (“ERP”) of the radio station’s antenna and the Height Above Average Terrain (“HAAT”) of the radio station’s antenna.

1. | Radio station KNTS-AM is an expanded band station paired with station KLFE-AM in the Seattle, WA market, and station KBJD-AM is an expanded band station paired with KRKS-AM in the Denver, CO market. We are operating these four stations pursuant to FCC licenses or other FCC authority pending resolution by the FCC of the issue of AM expanded band dual operating authority. Depending upon how the FCC resolves that issue, it is possible that we will be required to surrender one station license in each station pair. Except for these stations, we are not currently aware of any facts that would prevent the timely renewal of our licenses to operate our radio stations, although there can be no assurance that our licenses will be renewed.

2. | As part of an agreement between Salem and the FCC to allow a Salem subsidiary to acquire the license for KKOL(AM) despite objections to the sale and the then-pending license renewal, the FCC renewed the station’s license for a four-year, rather than eight-year, period to assess Salem’s commitment to continue to mitigate instances of blanketing interference as the station’s licensee.

 Ownership Matters. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to assign, transfer, grant or renew a broadcast license, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee, including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the “character” of the licensee and those persons holding “attributable” interests therein, and compliance with the Communications Act’s limitation on alien ownership, as well as compliance with other FCC policies, including equal employment opportunity requirements. 
 FCC rules and policies define the interests of individuals and entities, known as “attributable” interests, which implicate FCC rules governing ownership of broadcast stations and other specified mass media entities. Under these rules, attributable interests generally include: (1) officers and directors of a licensee and of its direct and indirect parents; (2) general partners; (3) limited partners and limited liability company members, unless properly “insulated” from management activities; (4) a 5% or more direct or indirect voting stock interest in a corporate licensee or parent, except that, for a narrowly defined class of passive investors, the attribution threshold is a 20% or more voting stock interest; and (5) combined equity and debt interests in excess of 33% of a licensee’s total asset value, if the interest holder provides over 15% of the licensee station’s total weekly programming, or has an attributable same-service (radio or television) broadcast or newspaper interest in the same market (“EDP Rule”). An entity that owns one or more radio stations in a market and programs more than 15% of the broadcast time or sells more than 15% per week of the advertising time on a radio station in the same market is generally deemed to have an attributable interest in that station. Debt instruments, non-voting corporate stock, minority voting stock interests in corporations having a single majority stockholder, and properly insulated limited partnership and limited liability company interests generally are not subject to attribution unless such interests implicate the EDP Rule. 
 The FCC ownership rules relevant to our business are summarized below. Because of these rules, a purchaser of voting stock of the company that acquires an “attributable” interest in the company may violate the FCC’s rule if it also has an attributable interest in another radio station, depending on the number and location of those radio stations. Such a purchaser also may be restricted in the other companies in which it may invest, to the extent that these investments give rise to an attributable interest. If an attributable stockholder of the company violates any of these ownership rules, the company may be unable to obtain from the FCC one or more authorizations needed to conduct its radio station business and may be unable to obtain FCC consents for certain future acquisitions. 
 Foreign Ownership: Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by a corporation that has more than one-fifth of its capital stock owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations. Under the Communications Act, there are limitations on the licensee of a broadcast license that is held by any corporation that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by any other corporation more than one-fourth of whose capital stock is owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations. These restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships. We, therefore, may be restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted by aliens, foreign governments, or non-U.S. corporations, although the FCC will entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing, proposals to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcasting holding companies. The FCC generally will not make such a determination absent favorable executive branch review. 
 Local Radio Ownership: The maximum allowable number of radio stations that may be commonly owned in a market is based on the size of the market. In markets with 45 or more stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to eight stations, of which no more than five are in the same radio service (AM or FM). In markets with 30-44 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to seven stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 15-29 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to six stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 14 or fewer stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to five stations, of which no more than three are in the 
 
23 


  same service, so long as the entity does not have an interest in more than 50% of all stations in the market. To apply these ownership tiers, the FCC relies on Nielsen Metro Survey Areas, where they exist, and a signal contour-overlap methodology where they do not exist. An FCC rulemaking is pending to determine how to define radio markets for stations located outside Nielsen Metro Survey Areas. 
 Our current ownership of radio broadcast stations complies with the FCC’s multiple ownership rules; however, these rules may limit the number of additional stations that we may acquire in the future in certain of our markets. 
 Cross-Ownership: In 2021, the FCC eliminated its prohibition on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule and its rule limiting common ownership of television stations and same market radio stations. 
 Review of Media Ownership Rules: 
 The Communications Act requires the FCC to periodically review its media ownership rules, and those reviews have been and continue to be the subject of litigation and follow-on regulatory proceedings. In November 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a decision that resulted in reinstatement of rules restricting cross-ownership of newspapers and broadcast radio (or television) stations, and of broadcast radio and television stations, which the FCC had previously eliminated. The Supreme Court of the United States vacated the Third Circuit’s decision in April 2021, and the rules prohibiting cross-ownership are therefore not currently in effect. 
 In December 2018, the FCC commenced its 2018 quadrennial review of its media ownership regulations. In June 2021, following the Supreme Court decision described above, the FCC sought comment to refresh the record in its 2018 quadrennial review. Without concluding the 2018 quadrennial review, the FCC issued a public notice in December 2022 commencing a new quadrennial review as required by statute. Among other things, the FCC is seeking comment on all aspects of the local radio ownership rule including whether the current version of the rule remains necessary in the public interest. The National Association of Broadcasters (“NAB”) has asked for a temporary toll of the 2022 review until the 2018 quadrennial review is complete. We cannot predict the outcome of the FCC’s media ownership proceedings or their effects on our business in the future. 
 Federal Antitrust Considerations. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), which evaluate transactions to determine whether those transactions should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws, are also active in their review of radio station acquisitions, particularly where an operator proposes to acquire additional stations in its existing markets. 
 For an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Improvements Act (“HSR Act”) and the rules promulgated thereunder require the parties to the acquisitions to file Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition. At any time before or after the consummation of a proposed acquisition, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws, as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or other assets of either party to the acquisition. The FTC or the DOJ may investigate acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the HSR Act under federal antitrust laws either before or after consummation of the transaction. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws. The DOJ has stated publicly that it believes that LMAs and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act could violate the HSR Act. 
 We can provide no assurances that our acquisition strategy will not be adversely affected in any material respect by antitrust reviews.

 Geographic Financial Information 
 Our customers are based in various locations throughout the United States. While no one customer currently accounts for 10% or more of our total revenue individually or in the aggregate, our broadcast operating segment is particularly dependent on revenue generated from our Los Angeles and Dallas broadcast markets. Our Los Angeles radio stations generated 9.4% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 10.1% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our Dallas radio stations generated 7.9% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 9.0% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Because substantial portions of our broadcast revenue are derived from our Los Angeles and Dallas markets, our ability to generate revenue in those markets could be adversely affected by local or regional economic downturns in these areas.
