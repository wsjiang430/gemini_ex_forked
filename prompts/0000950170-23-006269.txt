 Overview
 Day One was founded to address a critical unmet need: children with cancer are being left behind in a cancer drug development revolution. Our name was inspired by the “The Day One Talk” that physicians have with patients and their families about an initial cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. We aim to re-envision cancer drug development and redefine what’s possible for all people living with cancer—regardless of age—starting from Day One.
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing targeted therapies for patients of all ages with life threatening diseases. Initially, we have focused our clinical development efforts on pediatric patients living with cancer, a vulnerable population that has been underserved in the recent revolution in targeted therapeutics and immuno-oncology.
Our lead product candidate, tovorafenib (DAY101), is an oral, brain-penetrant, highly-selective type II pan-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, or pan-RAF, kinase inhibitor. Tovorafenib (DAY101) has been studied in over 325 patients and has been shown to be generally well-tolerated as a monotherapy. Tovorafenib (DAY101) has demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity in pediatric and adult populations with specific genetic alterations that result in the over-activation of the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase, or MAPK, pathway leading to uncontrolled cell growth.
Tovorafenib (DAY101) has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in August 2020 for the treatment of pediatric low-grade glioma, or pLGG, based on initial results from a Phase 1 trial which showed evidence of rapid anti-tumor activity and durable responses in pLGG patients. Pediatric low-grade glioma is the most common brain tumor diagnosed in children for which there is no standard of care and for which there are no approved therapies for the majority of patients. We received Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of malignant glioma from the FDA in September 2020 and from the EU Commission for the treatment of glioma in May 2021. Additionally, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation to tovorafenib (DAY101) for treatment of low-grade gliomas, or LGGs, harboring an activating RAF alteration in July 2021.
 We have initiated and fully enrolled a pivotal Phase 2 trial, or FIREFLY-1, of tovorafenib (DAY101) as a monotherapy for pediatric patients with relapsed or progressive low-grade glioma harboring an activating BRAF alteration. The first patient was dosed in FIREFLY-1 in May 2021 and we completed enrollment in the registrational arm in May 2022. The FIREFLY-1 trial has also been expanded to: (a) include two additional study arms to enable expanded access for eligible patients now that the primary cohort has completed enrollment, and (b) evaluate the preliminary efficacy of tovorafenib (DAY101) in patients aged six months to 25 years with a relapsed or progressive extracranial solid tumor with an activating RAF fusion. We reported initial data from an interim analysis from the FIREFLY-1 trial in June 2022 and top-line data for all patients in January 2023. Topline data from January 2023 demonstrated an overall response rate, or ORR, of 64% in the 69 Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology, or RANO, evaluable patients, comprising of 3 confirmed complete responses, or CR, and 41 partial responses, or PR (31 confirmed partial responses and 10 unconfirmed partial response, or uPR). We observed an additional 19 patients with stable disease, or SD, resulting in a clinical benefit rate of 91% (CR+ PR/uPR+ SD). Safety data, based on 77 treated patients, indicated monotherapy tovorafenib (DAY101) to be generally well-tolerated. We believe tumor reduction or stabilization is clinically meaningful for pLGG patients, as both are perceived as beneficial given the lack of approved therapies for the majority of patients. We anticipate presenting additional data from the FIREFLY-1 trial at an upcoming medical meeting in the second quarter of 2023, and reviewing key portions of the data from the study with the FDA at a pre-New Drug Application, or NDA, meeting in advance of our planned submission of an NDA in the first half of 2023.
 We initiated a pivotal Phase 3 trial, or FIREFLY-2, of tovorafenib (DAY101) as a frontline therapy in pLGG in June 2022. The first patient was dosed in FIREFLY-2 in March 2023.


Our second product candidate, pimasertib, is an oral, highly-selective small molecule inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2, or MEK, a well-characterized key signaling node in the MAPK pathway. Pimasertib has been studied in more than 10 Phase 1/2 clinical trials in over 850 patients with various tumor types, both as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care therapies. Published preclinical studies indicated that pimasertib has higher central nervous system, or CNS, penetration than other MEK inhibitors.
We have initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2a umbrella master trial, or FIRELIGHT-1, of tovorafenib monotherapy or combination therapy, which consists of two substudies. Substudy 1 is a Phase 2 trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) as monotherapy in patients 12 years and older with RAF–altered tumors; the first patient was dosed in November 2021. Substudy 2 is a Phase 1b/2 combination trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) and pimasertib in patients 12 years and older with various MAPK-altered solid tumors; the first patient was dosed in May 2022. Simultaneous inhibition of both RAF and MEK has been shown to lead to synergistic antitumor activity in preclinical models. This combination may demonstrate enhanced anti-tumor activity in a variety of adult solid tumors driven by MAPK alterations, including NRAS mutant melanoma and lung cancers, tumors driven by Class II BRAF alterations, tumors with BRAF wild-type fusions, and tumors driven by KRAS alterations.
 We believe our business development capabilities combined with our extensive experience in oncology drug development and deep ties within the research and patient advocacy communities, particularly within the pediatric setting, positions us to be a leader in identifying, acquiring and developing therapies for patients of all ages. We hold exclusive worldwide rights to tovorafenib (DAY101) and to pimasertib for all therapeutic areas subject to certain milestone and royalty payments.
 Each year, approximately 15,500 children under the age of 18 in the United States and 300,000 globally are diagnosed with cancer. Moreover, cancer remains the most common cause of death by disease for children in the United States, accounting for over 1,700 deaths per year. Despite the need for safer and more effective therapies for childhood cancers, new drugs for pediatric patients are rare. Of the 117 non-hormonal oncology drugs approved by the FDA between 1997 and 2017, only six had an initial approval that included children. Generally, medicinal product testing in children is deferred until trials in adults reach late-stage clinical development. As a result, the first pediatric trials of an oncology product candidate usually initiate about six years after an initial clinical trial in adults.
 In addition, the generation of large-scale molecular profiling datasets necessary to define addressable subpopulations in pediatric oncology has occurred relatively recently. Advances in our understanding of pediatric cancer biology have revealed patient populations with druggable genetic alterations. Our management team, which has significant pediatric oncology and rare diseases drug development experience, believes targeted therapies, such as tovorafenib (DAY101), have the potential to be studied in children sooner in order to address the large unmet need in pediatric cancers where new agents that address the specific genetic drivers of a tumor can meaningfully improve long-term prognosis.
Our team’s extensive capabilities and experience in pediatric oncology, and our relationships across all key stakeholders in the pediatric medical community, enable us to effectively navigate the challenges and nuances of pediatric drug development. We understand that clinical development in children cannot and should not simply be viewed as clinical development in small adults. We leverage our unique expertise to focus our initial development efforts on pediatric patients, given the potential for favorable regulatory pathways, namely Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug designations.
We are driven to help children and their families fight cancer while also addressing longstanding unmet medical needs. We believe there are a number of unique advantages to developing new oncology product candidates in pediatric patients:
 •Enriched responder populations. Many pediatric tumors are less heterogeneous and genomically more stable compared to highly heterogeneous adult tumors. Genetic alterations found in pediatric tumors are often primary driver oncogenic mutations. Directly targeting these mutations may lead to deep and sustained anti-tumor activity.
 •Ability to efficiently advance clinical development. Global regulatory authorities have established paths for accelerated feedback on the design and execution of clinical trials in pediatrics. Furthermore, the potential to achieve proof-of-concept and regulatory approval can be obtained with relatively smaller-sized clinical trials with clear endpoints.


•Regulatory and commercial tailwinds. The scarcity of approved products or an established standard-of-care in pediatric oncology provides multiple opportunities to bring new therapeutics to market. Passionate patient advocacy groups and investigators have the potential to accelerate the uptake of therapies, if approved.
 We seek to identify, acquire and develop product candidates that target high-value oncogenic drivers in cancers with high unmet need, with an initial focus on pediatric patients. The following table summarizes our product candidate pipeline.
 
Our lead product candidate, tovorafenib (DAY101), is an oral, brain-penetrant, highly-selective type II pan-RAF kinase inhibitor that inhibits both monomeric and dimeric RAF kinase. Approved BRAF products such as vemurafenib and encorafenib are referred to as type I RAF inhibitors, which only inhibit RAF monomers and are therefore limited to use in BRAF V600-altered tumors. Unlike type I RAF inhibitors, tovorafenib (DAY101) has not been shown to cause paradoxical activation in RAF wild-type cells at clinically active doses – a phenomenon wherein undesired increases in MAPK signaling can lead to renewed tumor growth. Tovorafenib’s (DAY101) inhibition of both RAF monomers and dimers broadens its potential clinical application to treat an array of RAS- or RAF-altered solid tumors. Furthermore, studies have shown tovorafenib (DAY101) has higher brain penetration, distribution and exposure in comparison to other MAPK pathway inhibitors. Taken together, we believe that tovorafenib (DAY101) has the potential to be a high-impact targeted therapeutic in pLGG, where over half of pLGGs are driven by abnormal signaling due to RAF alterations.

This rationale served as the basis on which researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute initiated the development of tovorafenib (DAY101) in pLGG. In a Phase 1 dose-escalation study, nine pediatric patients (<18 years of age) with relapsed pLGG were treated with tovorafenib (DAY101). Of the eight patients with RAF fusions, two achieved a complete response by Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology, or RANO, criteria, three had a partial response, two achieved prolonged stable disease, and one experienced progressive disease as assessed by an independent radiographic review. The median time to achieve a response was 10.5 weeks, which was a notable observation given pLGG is an indolent, slow-growing tumor. In addition to the rapid anti-tumor activity observed, tovorafenib (DAY101) was also well-tolerated, which is important for achieving and maintaining long-term, durable responses in these patients. Based on these results, tovorafenib (DAY101) has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for the treatment of pediatric patients with pLGG harboring an activating RAF alteration who require systemic therapy and who have either progressed following prior treatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Tovorafenib (DAY101) received Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of malignant glioma from the FDA in September 2020 and from the EU Commission for the treatment of glioma in May 2021. Additionally, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation to tovorafenib (DAY101) for treatment of LGGs harboring an activating RAF alteration in July 2021.
 Our second product candidate, pimasertib, is an oral, highly-selective small molecule inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2, or MEK, a well-characterized key signaling node in the MAPK pathway. Several MEK inhibitors have received regulatory approval for use in combination with type I RAF inhibitors in BRAF V600 mutant tumors. Preclinical experiments indicate that the potential benefit of combining a MEK inhibitor with a type II RAF inhibitor may be even greater due to the lack of the paradoxical effects of type II inhibitors on downstream signaling. Tovorafenib’s (DAY101) ability to selectively inhibit both RAF monomers and dimers may broaden its potential clinical application in combination with MEK inhibition in solid tumors driven by RAS alterations, non-BRAF V600 mutations, and RAF fusions.
We have assembled a leadership team with a proven track record of success in building biopharmaceutical companies, and a team of drug developers with unique experience and capabilities in pediatric drug development. Our Chief Executive Officer, Jeremy Bender, Ph.D., M.B.A., brings more than 15 years of biopharmaceutical leadership experience to the company. He previously served as Vice President of Corporate Development at Gilead Sciences where he led the team responsible for Gilead’s acquisitions, partnerships, and equity investments and oversaw more than 40 transactions exceeding $10 billion in upfront deal value, including the acquisition of Forty Seven, Inc. Samuel Blackman, M.D., Ph.D., our co-founder and Chief Medical Officer, is a physician-scientist trained in pediatric hematology/oncology and neuro-oncology, and has led the early clinical development of more than ten novel cancer therapeutics and was responsible for the pediatric development of dabrafenib, resulting in the first industry-sponsored pediatric oncology “basket trial.” Charles York II, our Chief Operating and Financial Officer, previously served as Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development at Aeglea BioTherapeutics and has more than 20 years of strategic capital formation and leadership experience. Davy Chiodin, PharmD, our Chief Development Officer, has over 15 years of experience in both adult and pediatric oncology drug development, including the development of acalabrutinib at Acerta, now AstraZeneca, and served as Global Regulatory Leader, Pediatric Oncology, at Roche/Genentech. Mike Preigh, Ph.D., our Chief of Technology Operations, has over 25 years of experience in product development including serving as the Head of CMC at Array for over 10 years, filing over 20 Investigational New Drug Applications, or INDs, and supporting the development of marketed drugs including binimetinib and tucatinib. Jaa Roberson, our Chief People Officer, has 20 years of human resources experience across the biopharma, health insurance, and retail industries. She previously served as Head of Human Resources for Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on cellular immuno-oncology. Adam Dubow, our General Counsel, has over 20 years of industry experience, most recently serving as Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer at Bristol Myers Squibb in various legal and policy roles in the United States, Asia and Europe.


Our Strategy
 We have a mission-driven strategy to build a differentiated, global biopharmaceutical company through the identification, development and commercialization of therapeutics that address underserved patient populations, with an initial focus on pediatric patients. The key elements of our strategy are to:
 •Establish a leadership position in targeted oncology therapeutics for patients of all ages through our unique expertise in pediatrics. We have built a targeted oncology company with differentiated business and clinical development capabilities. We leverage these capabilities to navigate the unique challenges and nuances of pediatric drug development. We initially focus on pediatric patients as we believe this provides a favorable pathway to approval for our product candidates. We have established trusted relationships with the pediatric oncology community, and we seek their advice on aligning our clinical development plans with the needs of the patients and their families. We believe we are a leader in this development space and to further this position, we plan to continue to consult and strategically partner with biopharmaceutical companies, academic pediatric oncologists and scientists, and patient advocacy groups to identify areas of unmet need in pediatric oncology and then acquire high-impact assets to address these underserved patients.
 •Advance our lead product candidate, tovorafenib (DAY101), through clinical development towards regulatory approval in pLGG. We have demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept of tovorafenib (DAY101) in pediatric patients for cancers that harbor genetic alterations in RAF. Oral, once-weekly dosed tovorafenib (DAY101) was also well-tolerated in the Phase 1 trial in pLGG, which is important for achieving and maintaining long-term, durable responses in these patients. Further, tovorafenib (DAY101) received FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of pediatric patients with pLGG harboring an activating RAF alteration who require systemic therapy and who have either progressed following prior treatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Tovorafenib (DAY101) also received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of malignant glioma. We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 2 FIREFLY-1 trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) as a monotherapy for pediatric patients with relapsed or pLGG harboring an activating BRAF alteration. We dosed the first patient in FIREFLY-1 in May 2021 and we completed enrollment in the registrational arm in May 2022. The FIREFLY-1 trial has also been expanded to: (a) include two additional study arms to enable expanded access for eligible patients now that the primary cohort has completed enrollment, and (b) evaluate the preliminary efficacy of tovorafenib (DAY101) in patients aged six months to 25 years with a relapsed or progressive extracranial solid tumor with an activating RAF fusion. We reported initial data from an interim analysis from this trial in June 2022 and top-line data for all patients in January 2023. We initiated a pivotal Phase 3 FIREFLY-2 trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) as a frontline therapy in pLGG in the second quarter of 2022. The first patient was dosed in FIREFLY-2 in March 2023.
 •Maximize the therapeutic potential for tovorafenib (DAY101) by targeting other tumors with various unaddressed MAPK alterations, including in adults, both as a monotherapy and in combination with our second product candidate, pimasertib. Tovorafenib (DAY101) has been dosed in over 325 patients in two adult Phase 1 open-label clinical trials—one trial investigating tovorafenib (DAY101) in monotherapy, and another in combination with other anti-cancer drugs. In both clinical trials, signs of early clinical responses emerged. Additionally, simultaneous inhibition of both RAF and MEK has been shown to lead to synergistic anti-tumor activity. We have initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2a FIRELIGHT-1 umbrella master trial of tovorafenib monotherapy or combination therapy, which consists of two substudies. Substudy 1 is a Phase 2 clinical trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) as monotherapy in patients 12 years and older with RAF–altered tumors; the first patient was dosed in November 2021. Substudy 2 is a Phase 1b/2 combination trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) and pimasertib in patients 12 years and older with various MAPK-altered solid tumors; the first patient was dosed in May 2022. Simultaneous inhibition of both RAF and MEK has been shown to lead to synergistic antitumor activity in preclinical models. This combination may demonstrate enhanced anti-tumor activity in a variety of adult solid tumors driven by MAPK alterations, including NRAS mutant melanoma and lung cancers, tumors driven by Class II BRAF alterations, tumors with BRAF wild-type fusions, and tumors driven by KRAS alterations.


•Deploy our differentiated and proven business development expertise to further expand our targeted oncology pipeline for patients with large unmet medical needs. Our team has diverse backgrounds—from academia and drug research and development, to biopharmaceutical industry and business development experience. We have a proven track record of identifying and acquiring drug candidates and programs with potentially significant commercial opportunities, including successfully in-licensing our current drug candidates, tovorafenib (DAY101) from Takeda and pimasertib from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. We will continue to utilize our broad experience, as well as our network of trusted relationships, to source additional high-impact assets to further expand our targeted oncology pipeline.
 •Evaluate opportunities to accelerate development timelines and enhance the commercial potential of our programs in collaboration with third parties. We own full worldwide development and commercialization rights to each of our programs subject to milestone and certain royalty payments. For additional information, see the subsection titled “Significant agreements.” In the future, we may selectively enter into collaborations where we believe there is an opportunity to accelerate the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We intend to commercialize our product candidates in key markets either alone or with partners in order to maximize the worldwide commercial potential of our programs.
 Our Approach: Prioritize Pediatric Cancer and Other Areas of High Unmet Need
 Our company is focused on prioritizing the clinical development of novel targeted therapeutics in pediatric patients. Historically, most pharmaceutical companies focused discovery and development efforts for new cancer therapies on adult tumor types. As a result, between 1997 and 2017, for the 126 drugs that received initial FDA approval for an oncology indication, the median time between the first-in-adult trial and the first-in-child trial was 6.5 years, regardless of whether or not the drug was a chemotherapeutic, a biologic agent, or a targeted therapeutic.
We believe that now is the right time to revisit and correct historic assumptions about pediatric oncology drug development. In doing so, we believe there are unique advantages to developing new oncology product candidates in pediatric patients, in parallel with, or even in advance of, adult indications:
 •Enriched responder populations. The generation of large-scale molecular profiling datasets necessary to define addressable subpopulations in pediatric oncology has accelerated over the last decade. This has allowed scientists and drug developers to identify oncogenic drivers underlying numerous pediatric tumor types, and has revealed druggable oncogenic drivers in nearly 50% of pediatric cancers. Moreover, pediatric tumors are less heterogeneous and genomically more stable compared to highly heterogeneous adult tumors. Directly targeting these mutations may lead to deep and sustained anti-tumor activity, as demonstrated by other targeted oncology products.
 •Ability to efficiently advance clinical development. Recently, global regulatory authorities have established paths for accelerated feedback on the design and execution of clinical trials in pediatrics. As part of the recent FDA Reauthorization Act, 205 relevant molecular targets were identified for pediatric cancers. In addition, new tumor-specific pediatric oncology consortia and cooperative groups have been established, allowing industry to sponsor pediatric clinical trials in the same manner as adult clinical trials. Further, the potential to achieve proof-of-concept and regulatory approval can be obtained with relatively smaller-sized clinical trials with clear endpoints.
 •Regulatory and commercial tailwinds. Of the 117 non-hormonal oncology drugs approved by the FDA between 1997 and 2017, only six had an initial approval that included children. The scarcity of approved products or an established standard of care, particularly in relapsed disease in pediatric oncology, provides multiple opportunities to bring new therapeutics to market. Passionate patient advocacy groups and investigators have the potential to accelerate the uptake of therapies, if approved.

Our company is uniquely positioned to deliver much-needed targeted therapeutics to pediatric oncology patients. We have extensive capabilities and experience with these patients, and our trusted relationships across all key stakeholders in the pediatric medical community enable us to effectively navigate the challenges and nuances of pediatric drug development. Key advantages that allow us to successfully identify and execute on opportunities in pediatric oncology include:
 •Aggregation of insights from a diverse group of key stakeholders to identify attractive development opportunities based on patient need and underlying biology. The broad scientific expertise of our team and within our trusted global network of scientific advisors, allows us to focus and identify areas of cancer biology that are relevant to children, adolescents and adults. For instance, the BRAF wild-type gene fusions that are the most common BRAF alteration in pLGG have been shown to be oncogenic in several adult solid tumor types, and may be addressable with tovorafenib (DAY101) as monotherapy, or in combination with a MEK inhibitor, such as pimasertib.
 •Business development opportunities enabled by key relationships and a dedication to prioritize pediatric drug development. We believe we are routinely among the first to evaluate emerging clinical and preclinical data that could underlie new drug development programs in pediatric oncology indications as a result of our deep roots and extensive network within the pediatric oncology research community. For example, we were made aware of the opportunity to in-license tovorafenib (DAY101) from Takeda, and were able to rapidly gain insights into the emerging data due to our relationships within the pediatric oncology investigational medicine community including but not limited to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium, or PNOC, and members of the Low Grade Glioma in Childhood, or LOGGIC, Consortium based at Hopp Children’s Cancer Center in Heidelberg, Germany.
 •Organizational focus on overcoming the historical challenges to executing pediatric clinical trials. We understand that clinical development in children is unique and must be approached as such. Clinical development in children is not the same as clinical development in adults and requires a deep organizational focus to address the needs of families, pediatric investigators, patient advocacy communities, and the patients. We have established trusted relationships with the pediatric oncology community globally, including major cooperative groups and disease-specific consortia, and we seek their advice on aligning our clinical development plans with the needs of the patients and their families. Our team is deeply experienced in designing modern, novel, and capital-efficient clinical development plans, as well as in obtaining early regulatory alignment on those plans—similar to an ultra-rare disease model. For example, as a result of the lack of any standard-of-care or approved therapies for the majority of pLGG patients, we believe that our pivotal Phase 2 trial is expected to provide a sufficient dataset to support approval based on preliminary discussions with regulatory agencies.
 These capabilities will enable us to develop targeted therapeutics from which pediatric patients can benefit. We believe we are a leader in this development space and to further this position, we plan to continue to consult and strategically partner with biopharmaceutical companies, academic pediatric oncologists and scientists, and patient advocacy groups to identify areas of unmet need in pediatric oncology and then acquire high-impact assets to address these underserved patients. While our initial focus is on pediatric patients, we also pursue the clinical development of targeted therapies with equivalent intensity for adult populations.


Our Product Candidates
 We seek to identify, acquire and develop product candidates that target high-value oncogenic drivers in cancers with high unmet need, with an initial focus on pediatric patients. Although our clinical development begins by leveraging our unique expertise in the pediatric oncology setting, we are committed to advancing targeted therapies for adult cancer patients with equivalent intensity. The following table summarizes our product candidate pipeline.
Tovorafenib (DAY101)
 Our lead product candidate, tovorafenib (DAY101), is an oral, brain-penetrant, highly-selective type II pan-RAF kinase inhibitor. Tovorafenib (DAY101) has been studied in over 325 patients, and as a monotherapy demonstrated good tolerability and encouraging anti-tumor activity in pediatric and adult populations with specific MAPK pathway-alterations. We have initiated and fully enrolled a pivotal Phase 2 FIREFLY-1 trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) as a monotherapy for pLGG, the most common brain tumor diagnosed in children, for which there are no approved therapies and no recognized standard of care for the majority of patients. The FIREFLY-1 trial has also been expanded to: (a) include two additional study arms to enable expanded access for eligible patients now that the primary cohort has completed enrollment, and (b) evaluate the preliminary efficacy of tovorafenib (DAY101) in patients aged six months to 25 years with a relapsed or progressive extracranial solid tumor with an activating RAF fusion. We reported initial data from an interim analysis from this trial in June 2022 and top-line data for all patients in January 2023. We anticipate presenting additional data from the FIREFLY-1 trial at an upcoming medical meeting in the second quarter of 2023, and reviewing key portions of the data from the study with the FDA, at a pre-NDA meeting in advance of our planned submission of an NDA in the first half of 2023. As is generally customary in our industry, we also anticipate reporting our data at a medical or scientific meeting in 2023. Tovorafenib (DAY101) has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for the treatment of pLGG based on initial results from a Phase 1 trial which showed evidence of rapid anti-tumor activity and durable responses in pLGG patients. We are also studying tovorafenib (DAY101) alone in combination with other agents that target key signaling nodes in the MAPK pathway in patient populations where various RAS and RAF alterations are believed to play an important role in driving disease.


RAF kinase drives cell proliferation and carcinogenesis
 Cell functions such as growth, survival and differentiation are regulated by cascades of signaling events of which RAF kinase is a critical component. RAF is a protein kinase that is normally activated by RAS, a protein that transmits activating signals from extracellular receptors to RAF. Activation of RAF then leads to the activation of MEK kinase and the downstream MAPK pathway. Genetic alterations that result in overactivation of the pathway, such as RAS or RAF alterations, have long been characterized as oncogenic.
 

Figure 1. RAF kinases (ARAF, BRAF, CRAF) are critical components of the MAPK pathway. BRAF V600E can signal as a monomer and is sensitive to type I and type II RAF inhibitors. Wild-type RAF dimers are only sensitive to type II RAF inhibitors. Modified from: Solit and Rosen, Cancer Discover, 2014.
One of the most frequently altered genes in this pathway is BRAF, one of three RAF genes in human cells and the form of RAF most easily activated by RAS. The majority of alterations in BRAF are mutations known as V600. Mutations in V600 transform non-mutant or wild-type BRAF into a form of BRAF that has increased signaling activity and is no longer dependent on RAS for activation. The abundance of V600 mutant BRAF and its central role in tumor growth have made it a focus of historical drug discovery efforts.
Another class of important oncogenic BRAF alterations are BRAF wild-type gene fusions. Gene fusions involving BRAF occur through intra- or inter-chromosomal rearrangements in which genes for unrelated proteins are physically joined together resulting in the synthesis of a chimeric protein. BRAF consists of a regulatory domain which modulates the activity of BRAF, and a catalytic kinase domain which then activates downstream signaling to promote cell growth. In BRAF fusions, the regulatory domain of BRAF is replaced with a different sequence, allowing BRAF to signal independent of RAS activation. This uncoupling of the regulatory and catalytic domains of BRAF has important consequences: the resultant novel oncogene is both aberrantly expressed and it also exhibits constitutive, or always-on, activation of the kinase domain. This kinase activity can result in the activation of downstream oncogenic signaling, exacerbating tumor growth. BRAF gene fusions have been observed in patients with prostate cancer, melanoma, radiation-induced thyroid cancer, and pLGG.


Three BRAF inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain solid tumors containing only BRAF V600E or V600K mutations, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancer, and colorectal cancer. These first-generation BRAF inhibitors, known more generally as type I RAF inhibitors, are vemurafenib, marketed as Zelboraf® by Genentech; dabrafenib, marketed as Tafinlar® by Novartis; and encorafenib, marketed as Braftovi® by Pfizer. However, despite initial clinical responses to monotherapy type 1 RAF inhibitors, most patients relapse within one year following the initiation of treatment.
One way by which resistance develops to type I RAF inhibitors is related to the mechanism of normal RAF activation in cells. In contrast to the constitutively active V600E or V600K variant, which is active as a monomer, normal RAF function requires formation of dimers of RAF. Approved inhibitors of V600E/K BRAF do not block the activity of RAF dimers or other non-V600 BRAF mutations. In fact, the binding of some of these inhibitors to V600E/K BRAF can stimulate the formation of dimers, thereby causing paradoxical activation (undesired increases in MAP kinase signaling) in RAF wild-type cells – a phenomenon which could potentially lead to renewed tumor growth. Paradoxical activation of wild-type RAF also occurs in non-tumor tissue. This leads to a common adverse event associated with these agents—the development of proliferative pre-malignant and malignant skin lesions. In order to avoid resistance and paradoxical activation, in many instances type I RAF inhibitors need to be given in combination with MEK inhibitors, but again only to patients with BRAF V600E/K mutations.
 

Figure 2. Schema showing the effect of different RAF inhibitors on monomeric RAF kinases (i.e., BRAF V600E; top section) or dimeric RAF kinases (bottom section). ERK activation is strongly activated downstream of BRAF V600E, even more so than seen for dimeric RAF kinase signaling. Monomer-selective type I RAF inhibitors bind to the ATP site in BRAF monomers and inhibit downstream signaling. In RAF dimeric kinases, binding of drug inhibits the bound RAF protomer, but leads to a conformational change in the other protomer in the dimer pair and strong transactivation of this protomer, leading to overall increased ERK activation (paradoxical activation). Type II RAF inhibitors are able to bind to mutant RAF monomers and dimers at equipotent doses and therefore can inhibit mutant RAF monomers and dimers at the same dose. Adapted from Yaeger and Corcoran, Cancer Discovery, 2019.
 Type I RAF inhibitors that target V600E/K alterations are not able to inhibit the wild-type RAF kinase domains in KIAA1549-BRAF gene fusions and are thus unable to effectively inhibit the overactive signaling that results from this fusion. Furthermore, because of the potential for paradoxical activation, these RAF inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with BRAF gene fusions.


DAY101's (tovorafenib) mechanism of action
 Tovorafenib (DAY101) is a selective, small molecule RAF inhibitor that can block the activity of multiple forms of RAF including wild-type RAF, BRAF and CRAF fusion proteins, and variants that function as dimers (Class II mutations), as well as variants such as BRAF V600E and non-V600E mutations that function as monomers (Class I mutations). Tovorafenib (DAY101) is known as a type II RAF inhibitor as it’s designed to inhibit both monomeric and dimeric RAF kinase. DAY101's (tovorafenib) inhibition of both RAF monomers and dimers broadens its potential clinical application to treat an array of RAF-altered tumors.
    Figure 3. Signaling pathways in different classes of BRAF mutations. BRAF V600 mutations (Class I) are independent of RAS signaling and work as monomers. BRAF non-V600 Class II mutations are also independent of RAS but signal as constitutive dimers. The Class II mutations include BRAF wild-type fusions. Non-V600 Class III BRAF mutations have low or no kinase activity and depend on RAS activation acting as amplifiers of the RAS signaling pathway. Tovorafenib (DAY101) inhibits Class I and Class II RAF alterations, including BRAF wild-type fusions and non-V600E/K variations. Modified from Fontana and Valeri, Clinical Cancer Research, 2019.
 Pediatric low-grade glioma disease and treatment overview
 Pediatric low-grade glioma is the most common brain tumor diagnosed in children, accounting for 30%-50% of all central nervous system tumors. For the most part, these tumors are slow-growing, chronic, and relentless. While malignant transformation and dissemination of pLGGs are rare there are many long-term consequences of the disease. The growth of pLGG is highly morbid as pLGG tumors are space-occupying lesions that have the potential to compress critical neurovascular structures in the brain. Symptoms can vary from patient to patient depending on the location of the tumor and the amount of pressure it exerts on surrounding tissues. These symptoms can include headaches, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, sixth cranial nerve palsies, seizures and behavioral changes, depending on tumor location. The majority of children with pLGG are long-term survivors and live into adulthood; however, survivors of pediatric glioma often suffer long-lasting functional, neurologic, and endocrine complications from their disease and/or treatment. These patients require more effective treatment strategies that minimize long-term morbidity and treatment-associated toxicity.

Patients with pLGG have historically been treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. While surgical resection of pLGG is associated with 10-year overall survival rates of 90% or more, the majority of children are unable to undergo complete resection, a procedure which can be associated in some instances with significant and long-lasting morbidity. Incompletely resected or unresectable pLGG is associated with a high rate of disease progression or recurrence. Patients with subtotal resections have a 10-year progression-free survival of only 55%. Although more modern radiation therapy modalities have been shown to lead to improvements in progression free survival, radiotherapy is historically associated with a risk of significant decline in neurocognitive outcomes in younger children, as well as the risk of endocrine dysfunction, secondary malignancy, and an increased risk of stroke. As a result, even modern radiation therapy techniques continue to be reserved for use when all other therapies have failed.
Most patients with progressive pLGG requiring initial systemic therapy are treated with combination chemotherapy such carboplatin/vincristine or, in certain countries, vinblastine as a single-agent. Results from the largest randomized Phase 3 study for children with newly diagnosed pLGG showed a 5-year event-free survival of 47% for vincristine/carboplatin. Outcomes for a subgroup of pLGG patients not associated with neurofibromatosis, which included those with BRAF alterations, were inferior, showing a 5-year event-free survival of 39%. Of note, the overall response rate to chemotherapy in newly diagnosed pLGG patients was 30%-35%. In addition to chemotherapy’s efficacy limitations, treatment-related morbidity was significant, with more than 95% of patients having experienced at least one Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse event. There is no standard-of-care therapy for patients whose tumors progress following the failure of these combinations, and no targeted therapeutics have been approved for this patient population.
 
Figure 4. Treatment paradigm for pLGG.
Because many pLGGs undergo senescence when patient ages reach their 20s, the goal of therapy is to maximize tumor control while minimizing treatment-associated toxicities from surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. As a result, a large number of pLGG patients will undergo multiple lines of systemic therapy over the course of their disease.
Based on incidence results published in academic journals, we estimate that approximately 1,100 patients under the age of 25 are newly diagnosed with BRAF-altered pLGG every year. We estimate that the SEER prevalence in the United States for patients under the age of 25 as of January 1, 2017 was approximately 130,000 patients presenting brain and other nervous system tumors, of which 26,000 presented BRAF-altered pLGG.

Over the last decade, it has been found that between 50% and 60% of pLGGs are driven by abnormal signaling due to alterations in RAF, approximately 85% to 90% of which are a gene fusion known as KIAA1549-BRAF. This gene alteration results in the expression of a wild-type BRAF catalytic domain without its normal regulatory domain, thereby rendering constitutively active BRAF activity. In addition, between 5% and 17% of children with pLGGs have tumors with a BRAF V600E activating mutation. No targeted therapeutics have been approved for the treatment of pLGG, and there are currently no therapies approved for pediatric patients with RAF alterations—the largest subset of patients with pLGG.
Indirect targeting of KIAA1549-BRAF gene alterations is possible with the off-label use of approved drugs that target components of the downstream RAF signaling pathway, such as with therapies that target MEK. Targeting of BRAF V600E mutations is possible with the off-label use of type I RAF inhibitors that have been approved for adult indications such as melanoma. An investigator-sponsored clinical trials of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib has recently been published. This study included 25 patients with either a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or a BRAF V600E mutation. Nine of 25 patients achieved a sustained partial response. Sixteen percent of patients had Grade 3 elevation on creatine phosphokinase, and 8% of patients had Grade 3 acneiform rash. Ten of 25 patients (40%) required a dose reduction due to treatment-related adverse events and one (4%) required two dose reductions. Similarly, a retrospective analysis of the MEK inhibitor trametinib in 18 patients was recently published, showing six partial responses, two minor responses, and 10 stable diseases as best overall responses. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 89% of patients, including 44% with severe (Grade 3 or Grade 4) adverse events, which required dose reduction in 33% of patients and discontinuation in 11% of patients. An industry-sponsored Phase 1/2a study of dabrafenib in 110 pLGG patients with BRAF V600E mutations was recently published, showing a confirmed objective response rate, or ORR, of 47%, which included one complete response and 13 partial responses, with a median duration of response of 26 months. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 28% of patients, and included new or increased size of melanocytic nevi in 25% of patients but no cases of squamous cell carcinoma. Ten patients (31%) had adverse events that led to dose interruptions or reductions, and 6% of patients had adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation. Finally, an industry-sponsored Phase 2 study of either trametinib monotherapy or dabrafenib/trametinib in combination in patients with BRAF V600 mutant relapsed/refractory pLGG was recently published. This study showed an independently assessed objective response rate of 15% for monotherapy trametinib (n=13) and 25% (n=36) for the combination. 25% of patients receiving the combination had serious adverse events. 16% of patients had adverse events leading to dose-reduction while 44% had an adverse event leading to dose interruption, and 11% had adverse events leading to drug discontinuation. The most common adverse events were pyrexia (50%), dry skin (41%), acneiform rash (39%), fatigue (39%), and rash (36%).
 Taken together, these investigations have shown some of the existing MEK and type I RAF inhibitors have been shown, in small trials, to have activity in pLGG, but are accompanied by frequent Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse events, and the need for dose reduction or interruption. With the exception of the combination of dabrafenib/trametinib for patients >6 years of age with relapsed/progressive tumors bearing a BRAF V600E/K mutation, there have been no agents approved for use in this population and as such, are only available via clinical trials or off-label prescription. Off-label use, while common in the pediatric oncology setting, is recognized to be an inferior approach as it exposes children to potential risks without the associated safeguards that accompany comprehensive clinical development activities, such as long-term safety monitoring and pharmacovigilance activities. We believe that the intentional development of a specifically-targeted, brain-penetrant therapy for pLGG is essential to improve outcomes for these patients, particularly those with BRAF fusions, and patients with BRAF V600E mutations who are either <6 years of age or who have progressed on, or cannot tolerate, combined Type I RAF/MEK inhibition.


Clinical trial results for pLGG
 Tovorafenib (DAY101) is currently being evaluated in an ongoing investigator-initiated, multi-center study (PNOC014, NCT03429803) in patients with relapsed/refractory gliomas (high- and low-grade) and other tumors that is being conducted by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in collaboration with PNOC. The trial remains open but is closed to new patient accrual. As of November 2022, a total of 44 patients had been enrolled in Part B of this Phase 1 dose-escalation trial (9 patients in Part A, 35 patients in Part B), which was conducted at multiple institutions within the PNOC network. Once-weekly tovorafenib (DAY101) at doses as high as 420 mg/m2/week were well-tolerated in patients ≥ 1.5m2, while doses as high as 530 mg/m2/week were found to be well-tolerated in patients < 1.5m2. Data was recently presented at the 2022 Society for Neuro-Oncology meeting for the 35 patients studied in Part B. For this group, there were two complete responses, seven partial responses, fifteen patients with stable disease and eight patients who had progressive disease. There were six dose limiting toxicities, all at 530 mg/m2/week, all Grade 3, and five known side effects (two fatigue, three rash, one menorrhagia).
As shown in Figure 5 below, the Phase 1 trial, which initially started in February 2018, was designed to determine maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, in pediatric patients. Part A of this trial was an initial dose-escalation of tovorafenib (DAY101) as monotherapy that utilized a 3+3 design. The starting dose of 280 mg/m2 was 80% of the adult recommended phase 2 dose, or RP2D, of 600 mg orally once weekly, adjusted for body surface area. Patients enrolled in this trial were treated for a period of up to two years. The trial was amended in December 2019 to continue dose escalation, using an adaptive design, until either dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, or the MTD was observed.
 

Figure 5. Design of the Phase 1 trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) in pLGG.

Tovorafenib (DAY101) was studied in a Phase 1 investigator-initiated trial (PNOC014; NCT03429803) in which it was administered once weekly as oral immediate release tablets to patients with relapsed/refractory tumors with LGGs and other RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway-activated tumors. Data from Part A of this study was presented in November 2020 in which tovorafenib was evaluated at three different dose levels: 280 mg/m2, 350 mg/m2, and 420 mg/m2, with three patients at each dose level. Tovorafenib was well tolerated at all doses tested with no dose reductions or interruptions in patients receiving doses of 420 mg/m2 or below. None of these patients experienced a DLT. The vast majority of treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were Grade 1 or 2. No ophthalmologic or cardiac adverse events were observed. The most frequently reported TEAEs across all dose cohorts in Part A were all Grade 1 or 2 in severity and included rash (89%), graying of the hair (achromotrichia) (78%), moles (nevus) (78%), anemia (67%), and itching (pruritis) (67%). One patient experienced a single Grade 3 adverse event (increased creatinine phosphokinase), and there were no Grade 4 adverse events reported. These side effects were found to be reversible and manageable.
While 420 mg/m2 was initially considered the RP2D because of anti-tumor activity observed at all dose levels in Part A, dose escalation was continued in Part B of this study an attempt to determine a MTD. Upon resumption of the dose-escalation portion in Part B of this trial, the dose escalation was split between two subgroups, based on body surface area, to account for the possibility that at dose levels of 530mg/m2 or higher there might be larger children that may exceed the adult MTD at a given dose level, while smaller children may not. Data from Part B of this study was presented in November of 2022. Thirty-five additional patients were enrolled in Part B PNOC014: 21 patients with gliomas bearing a KIAA1549:BRAF fusion, nine patients with tumors bearing a BRAFV600E mutation, four with a novel RAF- and one with an FGFR1-altered tumor. Histologically, cohort included 30 LGGs, four high grade gliomas and one soft tissue sarcoma. There were six DLTs: three in each body surface area, or BSA, subgroup, all at 530 mg/m2/dose, all Grade 3, and five known side effects (two fatigue, three rash, one menorrhagia). Across these 35 patients, oral weekly tovorafenib (DAY101) was well tolerated. While the TITE-BOIN continuous reassessment model recommended 530 mg/m2/dose per os, or PO, weekly for patients with BSA < 1.5m2 and 420 mg/m2/dose PO weekly for patients with BSA >1.5m2, the probability of a DLT for patients with a BSA < 1.5m2 was found to be nearly 20%. As such, 420 mg/m2/dose PO weekly was selected as the dose for the pivotal Phase 2 FIREFLY-1 and pivotal Phase 3 FIREFLY-2 studies.
Overall, data from the now-completed Part A, where the patients received up to two years of continuous treatment, supported by data from Part B, indicate that the tolerability profile of tovorafenib (DAY101) at 420mg/m2 supports the potential for chronic long-term usage of tovorafenib (DAY101).
 A standard objective measure of efficacy accepted by the FDA for brain tumors is a set of radiographic measurement criteria called RANO. RANO criteria take into account various measures of tumor dimensions to track response to therapy or disease progression. Data from patients in Part A of PNOC014 were reviewed by an independent neuro-radiologist using RANO criteria. Eight of the nine patients had a pLGG with a RAF fusion (seven with a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion and one with an SRGAP3-CRAF fusion), while one patient had a loss-of-function mutation in the gene for neurofibromatosis 1, or NF1. As seen in Figure 6 below, five of the eight patients with a RAF fusion had either a complete response or a partial response per RANO criteria, defined as 50% decrease, compared with baseline; the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks. Two of eight patients with a RAF fusion had prolonged stable disease. One patient with a RAF fusion did not respond to tovorafenib (DAY101). The one patient with an NF1-associated pLGG did not respond to tovorafenib (DAY101). Radiologic responses using exploratory imaging measures such as volumetric image analysis or the recently published, but clinically unvalidated, RAPNO Criteria, or Response Assessment for Pediatric Neuro-Oncology, which we believe were largely consistent with the RANO scores.
 


Figure 6. Five of nine patients in the tovorafenib (DAY101) Phase 1 trial in pLGG had a complete (100% reduction) or partial response (>50% reduction in the bi-dimensional measurement of the tumor).
 In addition to evaluating responses on-treatment, target lesions were identified in each patient during screening and baseline growth kinetics calculated from prior radiologic images. For eight of the nine patients, there was a documented history of tumor growth prior to trial enrollment. As shown in Figure 7, shrinkage in lesion size was observed in six of nine patients in the first radiologic images obtained after initiation of tovorafenib (DAY101) dosing. The median time to response was 10.5 weeks, which is a notable observation given pLGG is an indolent, slow-growing tumor. Two patients achieved a complete response that was maintained throughout the dosing period of up to two years. Three patients had a partial response, two achieved prolonged stable disease, and two did not achieve a response. The trial allowed for treatment for maximum duration of two years.
 
Figure 7. Individual patient responses in the tovorafenib (DAY101) Phase 1 trial in pLGG.
 Based on the results from Part A of PNOC014, tovorafenib (DAY101) has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for the treatment of pediatric patients with pLGG harboring an activating RAF alteration who require systemic therapy and who have either progressed following prior treatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Tovorafenib (DAY101) also received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of malignant glioma.


Clinical development plan for pLGG
 We have initiated a pivotal Phase 2 FIREFLY-1 trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) in pediatric patients aged six months to 25 years with relapsed or progressive pLGGs harboring an activating BRAF alteration, such as a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or a BRAF activating mutation, such as V600E. This is an open-label, global registrational, single-arm trial of oral tovorafenib (DAY101) administered once weekly at a dose of 420 mg/m2. Patients will continue on tovorafenib (DAY101) until radiographic evidence of disease progression by RANO criteria as determined by treating investigator, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal of consent, or death. The first patient was dosed in FIREFLY-1 in May 2021 and we completed enrollment in the registrational arm in May 2022. The FIREFLY-1 trial has also been expanded to: (a) include two additional study arms to enable expanded access for eligible patients now that the primary cohort has completed enrollment, and (b) evaluate the preliminary efficacy of tovorafenib (DAY101) in patients aged six months to 25 years with a relapsed or progressive extracranial solid tumor with an activating RAF fusion. We anticipate that this trial will generate a dataset that, in combination with the existing safety database, will have the potential to serve as the basis for regulatory approval. We anticipate the primary endpoint will be overall response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with best overall confirmed response rate (complete response and partial response based on the RANO criteria), as determined by independent review. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include the overall response rate based on RAPNO and volumetric analyses, event free survival, safety, functional outcomes, and quality of life measures.
 
Figure 8. Design of the Phase 2 trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) in pLGG.
Tovorafenib (DAY101) is currently dosed as immediate-release tablets. We have developed a pediatric formulation suitable for oral dosing of children as young as six months of age and have dosed patients with this pediatric formulation in our pivotal Phase 2 FIREFLY-1 trial.
Comprehensive genomic profiling of newly-diagnosed or recurrent/progressive pLGG is standard practice within pediatric neuro-oncology programs across the United States, either utilizing CLIA/College of American Pathologists, or CAP, accredited hospital laboratories or third-party commercial vendors. In addition, the 2021 revision of the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System now includes assessment of BRAF mutation or fusion status as part of the diagnosis of LGGs. As a result, we expect that the vast majority of both newly diagnosed and relapsed pLGG patients with BRAF alterations will be identified. The technology platforms and solutions for the identification of the BRAF V600E mutation and BRAF wild-type fusions currently in use by individual investigators will be used to meet the clinical trial enrollment criteria, while we continue to work with regulatory authorities to ensure that any requirement for a companion diagnostic assay or device are met, for which we have entered into a collaboration with Foundation Medicine, Inc. to develop. 

We have initiated a pivotal Phase 3 FIREFLY-2 trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) as a frontline therapy in pLGG. The first patient was dosed in March 2023. We believe that treating patients before they have undergone multiple rounds of toxic chemotherapy has the potential to both improve the efficacy of tovorafenib (DAY101) and reduce the overall burden of therapy and associated toxicities associated with the use of currently-employed cytotoxic agents.

 Potential market opportunity for tovorafenib (DAY101) in pLGG
 Brain tumors are the most frequently occurring solid tumors in children. While pLGG is the most common brain tumor diagnosed, representing approximately 30% of all childhood brain tumors, the annual estimated incidence of pLGG is 1.3 to 2.1 per 100,000 in the United States, accounting for about 1,000–1,600 new diagnoses in 2015. Given the incidence of this disease, our team recognized the market opportunity for developing tovorafenib (DAY101) in this patient population based on the following rationale:
 •Potential for tovorafenib (DAY101), a pan-RAF inhibitor, to be a high-impact targeted therapeutic in pLGG where approximately 70% of tumors are BRAF-altered pLGG in the United States.
 •Premium reimbursement precedents for high impact therapeutics in rare diseases, oncology and pediatrics.
 •Chronic duration of treatment required over many years to address these slow-growing and relentless tumors.
 •High unmet medical need with limited current treatment alternatives for patients.
 •Strong value proposition for physicians, patients and families.
 We believe tovorafenib (DAY101), if approved, could become the standard of care for the treatment of pLGG. Due to the need for chronic administration, potentially over many years, the standard of care should be an effective, long-term therapeutic while providing a tolerability profile that minimizes long-term morbidity and treatment-associated toxicity. We believe that tovorafenib (DAY101) has the potential to provide long-term benefit—similar to effective therapies for more traditional chronic rare diseases—to patients with pLGG. Observations from the Phase 1 trial, tovorafenib’s (DAY101) profile suggest that tovorafenib (DAY101) can potentially balance high rates of CNS penetrance leading to rapid and durable anti-tumor activity with favorable tolerability, a lack of serious adverse events in these pediatric patients, and clinical experience of long-term dosing of tovorafenib (DAY101) weekly for up to two years. We also believe that tovorafenib’s (DAY101) oral, once-weekly dosing regimen would appeal to physicians, patients and their parents.


Potential applications of tovorafenib (DAY101) in other MAPK-driven tumors
 To expand on our initial clinical development efforts in pediatric patients, we plan to explore tovorafenib (DAY101) in additional indications for adolescent and adult patient populations where various MAPK pathway alterations are believed to play an important role in driving disease. This is supported by data from over 225 adult patients dosed with tovorafenib (DAY101) in two separate Phase 1 trials previously conducted by Takeda. These trials also informed the starting dose level and weekly dosing regimen for future clinical trials, including the ongoing pivotal Phase 2 trial in pLGG. Results from these trials demonstrated that tovorafenib (DAY101) was well-tolerated in patients with advanced cancers, both alone and in combination with other anti-cancer agents, but because patients were not enriched for RAF alterations expected to respond to tovorafenib (DAY101) monotherapy, or studied in combinations that are now known to be more likely to lead to anti-tumor activity, only modest signs of efficacy were observed.
Based on data from preclinical studies, and building on the initial data from the Takeda-led Phase 1 trials, we have initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2a FIRELIGHT-1 umbrella master trial of tovorafenib monotherapy or combination therapy, which consists of two substudies. Substudy 1 is a Phase 2 clinical trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) as monotherapy in patients 12 years and older with RAF-altered tumors; the first patient was dosed in November 2021. Substudy 2 is a Phase 1b/2 combination trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) and pimasertib in patients 12 years and older with various MAPK-altered solid tumors; the first patient was dosed in May 2022. Simultaneous inhibition of both RAF and MEK has been shown to lead to synergistic antitumor activity in preclinical models. This combination may demonstrate enhanced anti-tumor activity in a variety of adult solid tumors driven by MAPK alterations, including NRAS mutant melanoma and lung cancers, tumors driven by Class II BRAF alterations, and tumors driven by KRAS alterations.
 In the future, we may explore tovorafenib (DAY101) in combination with other selective inhibitors of key nodes in the MAPK signaling pathway. For example, a type II RAF inhibitor may provide synergistic benefit in combination with inhibitors of ERK or SHP2. We believe the ability of tovorafenib (DAY101) to inhibit multiple forms of RAF gene alterations, including wild-type RAF and RAF dimers, without triggering the liabilities of paradoxical activation observed with approved type I RAF inhibitors, enhance its profile as a potential backbone of combinations therapies designed to inhibit MAPK signaling in cancer.
 Investigator-initiated trials of tovorafenib (DAY101)
 We intend to leverage our relationships with academic investigators and pediatric oncology cooperative groups and consortia to explore the potential for tovorafenib (DAY101) in other rare pediatric tumor types.
A Phase 2 trial in relapsed Langerhans cell histiocytosis was initiated in March 2022 by the Children’s Oncology Group, a National Cancer Institute-supported clinical trials group and the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research. This study is a single-arm non-randomized trial which has an estimated enrollment of 28 participants, who will be administered tovorafenib (DAY101) to determine overall response rate for children and young adults with relapsed or refractory Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
 A second Phase 2 trial in craniopharyngioma was initiated in July 2022 by the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium. This study is a randomized multi-arm trial, which has an estimate enrollment of 56 patients, who will be administered nivolumb and tovorafenib (DAY101) in combination with nivolumb to assess the tolerability and efficacy of combination therapy with PD-1 (nivolumab) and pan-RAF-kinase (tovorafenib) inhibition for the treatment of children and young adults with craniopharyngioma.


Pimasertib
 Pimasertib is an oral, highly-selective allosteric small molecular inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK). Published preclinical studies indicated that pimasertib has higher CNS penetration than other MEK inhibitors. We obtained an exclusive license to pimasertib from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany in February 2021, and initiated a Phase 1b/2 umbrella master trial in MAPK-altered tumors in March 2022 to study the potentially beneficial combination of tovorafenib (DAY101) and pimasertib in patients 12 years and older. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany previously undertook extensive non-clinical and clinical development work through Phase 2, including a solid tumor trial in Japan and combinations of pimasertib with other agents. Pimasertib showed monotherapy clinical activity, including an improvement in the objective response rate and progression free survival, but not overall survival, in patients NRAS-mutant melanoma when compared to dacarbazine in a prospective randomized Phase 2 trial. The main adverse events observed during the clinical development of pimasertib were typical for other in-class allosteric MEK inhibitors, including GI-related adverse events, elevation of CPK, skin rash, and visual disturbances.
 Preclinical studies
 MEK is a critical signaling node that lies downstream of RAS in the MAPK pathway, and is a unique dual-specificity kinase that phosphorylates both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. MEK consists of two isoforms, MEK1 and MEK2, which in turn phosphorylate ERK1 and ERK2. Activated ERK1/2 control a diverse range of cellular processes through their many substrates (>160) that are located in cellular membranes, the cytoplasm and nucleus. Many of these are transcription factors that are important in cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival, angiogenesis and migration. 
As shown below in Figure 10, in cancers driven by elevated RAS or RAF signaling, inhibition of MEK releases the blockade on RAS and can contribute to increased RAS-mediated signaling and pathway activation, further desensitizing the cells to MEK inhibition. MEK inhibitors given as a monotherapy have demonstrated limited anti-tumor activity in preclinical tumor models of elevated RAS or RAF signaling. Most cancers that acquire resistance to MEKi and continue to proliferate do so through reactivation of the MAPK pathway and subsequent reactivation of ERK. ERK reactivation can occur through alterations or mutations to molecules upstream of ERK in the MAPK pathway such as RAS, RAF, NF1, or MEK. One approach to circumvent the overactivation of RAS signaling in such tumor models has been to combine a RAF inhibitor with a MEK inhibitor to inhibit the pathway at two different nodes which has been shown by multiple groups to result in synergistic effects on inhibiting cell and tumor model growth.
 


Figure 10: Dual inhibition of BRAF and MEK is an important strategy for addressing MAPK-driven tumors.
 

Figure 11. Model of the proposed mechanism of induced RAF inhibitor sensitivity. Left panel: under basal conditions, the MAPK pathway has multiple feedback loops negatively regulating upstream pathway activation, including RAS-GTP levels and RAF activation, thereby ensuring optimal pathway signaling. Middle panel: upon MEK inhibitor treatment, these feedback loops are disabled resulting in RAS-GTP induction, BRAF/CRAF dimerization, and RAF kinase activation. Right panel: Combination treatment with a MEK inhibitor and a type II RAF inhibitor is expected to exhibit synergistic effects. Modified from Yen et al. Cancer Cell, 2018.


Consistent with this approach, preclinical experiments showed the combination of a type II RAF inhibitor and pimasertib indeed led to synergistic cell killing activity. Calu-6 cells, a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line containing a KRAS G12C mutation, was found to be sensitive to cell killing by both BGB-283, a type II RAF inhibitor, and pimasertib. Treatment of Calu-6 cells with a combination of these inhibitors resulted in greater cell killing, as the EC50 for a 3 µM dose of BGB-283 was lowered by approximately 60-fold in the presence of pimasertib. These results suggest treatment with a MEK inhibitor in the presence of a RAF inhibitor result in an added cell killing benefit than observed with either inhibitor alone.
 

Figure 12. The sensitivity of Calu-6 cells to pimasertib was enhanced when cells were treated with BGB-283, a type II RAF inhibitor.
 Similarly, in experiments with Calu-6 cells as well as NCI-H1792 cells, which contain a KRAS G12C mutation, cell lines were shown to be sensitive to either tovorafenib (DAY101) or MEKi-1 as monotherapy, however a combination of these inhibitors resulted in greater cell killing than observed with either inhibitor alone. These data further support the potential added benefit of combining a MEK inhibitor, with a type II RAF inhibitor, such as DAY 101 as a strategy to address certain MAPK-driven adult solid tumors.
 


Figure 13. Synergy was observed with tovorafenib (DAY101) when combined with the MEK inhibitor in KRAS G12C or Q61 mutant tumor cell lines in vitro.
 Clinical results
 Pimasertib has been dosed in over 850 cancer patients in trials sponsored by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany KGaA, both as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care therapies, such as gemcitabine, dacarbazine, and the colorectal cancer regimen FOLFIRI, as well as selected investigational agents (the HDM2 inhibitor SAR405838, the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor SAR245409). To date, there have been no clinical trials investigating the potential of pimasertib in combination with a RAF inhibitor.


The initial Phase 1 trial of pimasertib was designed to evaluate different schedules and escalating doses of pimasertib monotherapy in patients with various solid tumors, including colorectal, melanoma, prostate, lung, and mesothelioma. The primary goal of this trial was to establish safety and pharmacokinetics to determine the most appropriate dose and schedule for further investigation. Preliminary efficacy was also assessed in terms of tumor response. While several examples of stable disease were observed across tumor types, multiple partial responses were observed in melanoma patients that triggered further investigations in this tumor type. In a dose expansion arm of this trial, 89 melanoma patients received pharmacologically active doses of pimasertib ranging from 28 mg to 255 mg/day across four dose regimens. The ORR was 12.4%, including one complete response, ten partial responses, and 46 patients with stable disease. In the Phase 1 monotherapy trial, dose limiting toxicities were mainly observed at doses of 120 mg/day or greater and included skin rash/acneiform dermatitis and ocular events, such as serous retinal detachment. The most common drug-related adverse events were consistent with effects observed with other MEK inhibitors, including diarrhea, skin disorders, ocular disorders, asthenia/fatigue, and peripheral edema. According to a publication of the results of the melanoma patients enrolled on the monotherapy Phase 1 clinical trial, TEAEs of Grade 3 or higher were experienced by eight out of the 69 patients enrolled. The TEAEs were skin events (n=4), ocular events (n=2) and diarrhea (n=2). All four skin events occurred in the continuous (R3) twice-daily group, whereas ocular and diarrhea events were reported in both the continuous twice-daily group and the discontinuous group. High doses of pimasertib were associated with cases of retinal detachment; however, this and all other toxicities were manageable with supportive care and treatment interruption or dose reduction.
 Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany also conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized Phase 2 trial in 194 patients with NRAS-mutated locally advanced or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, which compared single-agent pimasertib dosed at 60 mg BID to dacarbazine. Median progression free survival, or PFS, in pimasertib treated patients was 13.0 weeks, which was significantly longer than the 6.9 weeks observed in dacarbazine treated patients.
 Clinical development plan
 We have initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2a FIRELIGHT-1 umbrella master trial of tovorafenib monotherapy or combination therapy, which consists of two substudies. Substudy 1 is a Phase 2 clinical trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) as monotherapy in patients 12 years and older with RAF–altered tumors; the first patient was dosed in November 2021. Substudy 2 is a Phase 1b/2 combination trial of tovorafenib (DAY101) and pimasertib in patients 12 years and older with NRAS mutations, BRAFwt fusions and other BRAF mutations with the exception of V600E and V600K mutations; the first patient was dosed in May 2022. The combination substudy will be a Phase 1b dose ranging trial to establish the Phase 2 dose of tovorafenib (DAY101) in combination with pimasertib. Once this dose is established, patients will be enrolled in the combination dose expansion portion of this trial in cohorts defined by genetic aberration, such as NRAS mutation or BRAFwt fusion. The primary endpoint for the Phase 1b portion of the combination substudy is safety. For the monotherapy substudy in RAFwt fusions and RAF1 amplifications and the Phase 2 expansion cohorts, the primary endpoint is overall response rate and duration of response. Simultaneous inhibition of both RAF and MEK has been shown to lead to synergistic antitumor activity in preclinical models. This combination may demonstrate enhanced anti-tumor activity in a variety of adult solid tumors driven by MAPK alterations, including NRAS mutant melanoma and lung cancers, tumors driven by Class II BRAF alterations, tumors with BRAF wild-type fusions, and tumors driven by KRAS alterations.

Figure 15. Umbrella master trial – DAY101-102 (main protocol) tovorafenib (DAY101) and MAPK pathway aberration, Substudy 2 MEK combo (DAY101-102b).
 Preclinical data from multiple groups suggest that the combination of a MEK inhibitor, such as pimasertib, and a type II RAF inhibitor will have beneficial activity in various MAPK-driven tumor contexts, meaning that potent cell killing activity was obtained at lower concentrations of pimasertib than expected from data generated from monotherapy treatment. We believe that appropriate dosing of pimasertib in combination with tovorafenib (DAY101) may limit frequency and severity of adverse events observed with pimasertib alone, dosed at the MTD, owing to the ability to define a biologically active dose combination. We anticipate exploring pediatric combination trials once additional dosing and safety data is collected in adult patients.
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational product candidates, as well as our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates.
To date, we have contracted to obtain active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, drug product, and packaging/distribution for our product candidates from STA Pharmaceutical Hong Kong Limited, Quotient Sciences – Philadelphia, LLC, Experic Services, and Fisher Clinical Services respectively, upon whom we currently rely as single-source contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs. We have agreements under which third-party CMOs will generally provide us with necessary quantities of API, drug product, packaging/distribution on an order by order basis, based on our development needs. For commercial supply of tovorafenib, we are in the process of negotiating supply agreements to meet the anticipated commercial demand of the product. As we advance our product candidates through development, we will explore adding backup suppliers for the API, drug product, packaging and formulation for each of our product candidates to protect against any potential supply disruptions.
 We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop.


Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, the expertise of our team, and our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face increasing competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
 Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, and are more convenient or less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or could otherwise make our development more complicated. We believe the key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety and patient convenience.
 We believe that tovorafenib (DAY101) has the potential to be the first pan-RAF inhibitor to be approved by the FDA, for use in the treatment of pLGG, as we are not aware of competing product candidates that are further along in the development process. However, this does not indicate that tovorafenib (DAY101) has been proven effective or that it will receive regulatory approval.
 Three BRAF inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of tumors containing V600E or V600K mutations. These first-generation BRAF inhibitors, known more generally as type I RAF inhibitors, are vemurafenib, marketed as Zelboraf® by Genentech; dabrafenib, marketed as Tafinlar® by Novartis; and encorafenib, marketed as Braftovi® by Pfizer. Dabrafinib, in combination with trametinib, marketed as Mekinist® by Novartis, has been approved for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with BRAF V600E mutation who have progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. This includes BRAF V600E pLGG, a subset (approximately 10%-20%) of the greater RAF-altered pLGG clinical scope of the tovorafenib (DAY101) development program.
Four MEK inhibitors have been approved by the FDA. Three have been approved for the treatment of tumors containing BRAF V600E or V600K mutations, including cobimetinib, marketed as Cotellic® by Genentech; trametinib, marketed as Mekinist® by Novartis; and binimetinib, marketed as Mektovi® by Pfizer. A fourth MEK inhibitor–selumetinib, marketed as Koselugo® by AstraZeneca, has been approved for the treatment of pediatric patients, 2 years of age and older, with neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF1, who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas.
 Erasca is developing the next-generation BRAF inhibitor naporafenib (LXH254) in combination with various agents, in planned Phase 1 and Phase 3 clinical trials. BeiGene has two next-generation BRAF programs: lifirafenib (BGB-283), which is currently in a Phase 1/2 trial in combination with mirdametinib, and BGB-3245 which is currently in a single agent in Phase 1 dose escalation study. Hanmi and Genentech are developing belvarafenib in combination with cobimetinib in a Phase 1b clinical trial. Fore Therapeutics (formelly NovellusDx) is developing the RAF dimer breaker PLX8394 in a Phase 1/2 trial in combination with cobicistat. Kinnate is developing KIN-2787 in monotherapy phase 1 clinical trial. Black Diamond Therapeutics have next-generation BRAF inhibitors in various stages of preclinical development.


With regard to the treatment of pLGG, dabrafenib, in combination with trametinib, is being evaluated in a Novartis-sponsored randomized Phase 2 clinical trial in newly diagnosed patients with BRAF V600 mutant pLGG. Novartis has announced their plans to file a Supplemental New Drug Application based on data of this trial in early 2023. Further, some MEK inhibitors and some type I RAF inhibitors and other targeted therapies are being studied in academic investigator-initiated clinical trials, and in some regions may be being used in an off-label manner. These agents may represent competition for tovorafenib (DAY101) when it enters the market.
 Significant Agreements
 Takeda asset agreement and Millennium stock exchange agreement
 On December 16, 2019, DOT Therapeutics-1, Inc., or DOT-1, our subsidiary, entered into an asset purchase agreement, or the Takeda Asset Agreement, with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a related party and an affiliate of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda. Pursuant to the Takeda Asset Agreement, DOT-1 purchased certain technology rights and know-how related to TAK-580 (which is now tovorafenib (DAY101)) that provides a new approach for treating patients with primary brain tumors or brain metastases of solid tumors. DOT-1 also received clinical inventory supplies to use in our research and development activities of such RAF-inhibitor and an assigned investigator clinical trial agreement. Takeda also assigned to DOT-1 its exclusive license agreement, or the Viracta License Agreement, with Viracta Therapeutics, Inc. (f/k/a Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), or Viracta. Takeda also granted DOT-1 a worldwide, sublicensable exclusive license under specified patents and know-how and non-exclusive license under other patents and know-how generated by Takeda under the Takeda Asset Agreement. DOT-1 also granted Takeda a grant back license, as defined in the Takeda Asset Agreement, which is terminable either automatically or by DOT-1 in the event Takeda does not achieve specified development milestones within the applicable timeframes set forth under the Takeda Asset Agreement. This grant back license to Takeda was terminated at the time of Conversion in connection with the Millennium Stock Exchange Agreement.
 In consideration for the sale and assignment of assets and the grant of the license under the Takeda Asset Agreement, DOT-1 made an upfront payment of $1.0 million in cash and issued 9,857,143 shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock in DOT-1 in December 2019. The fair value of issued shares was estimated as $9.9 million, based on the price paid by other investors for issued shares in the Series A financing of DOT-1. Based on the terms of the Millennium Stock Exchange Agreement, Takeda exchanged the 9,857,143 shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock of DOT-1 for 6,470,382 shares of our common stock upon the effectiveness of the Conversion, on May 26, 2021. 
The term of the Takeda Asset Agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis upon expiration of all assigned patent rights and all licensed patent rights in such country. Takeda may terminate the Takeda Asset Agreement prior to our first commercial sale of a product if we cease conducting any development activities for a continuous and specified period of time and such cessation is not agreed upon by the parties and is not done in response to guidance from a regulatory authority. Additionally, Takeda can terminate the Takeda Asset Agreement in the event of our bankruptcy. In the event of termination of the Takeda Asset Agreement by Takeda as a result of our cessation of development or bankruptcy, all assigned patents, know-how and contracts (other than the Viracta License Agreement) will be assigned back to Takeda and Takeda will obtain a reversion license under patents and know-how generated to exploit all such terminated products.
Effective December 31, 2021, DOT-1 was merged with and into our company, with our company being the surviving corporation and assuming DOT-1’s obligations under the Takeda Assets Purchase Agreement.
Viracta license agreement
 On December 16, 2019, DOT-1 amended and restated the Viracta License Agreement that was assigned pursuant to the Takeda Asset Agreement. Under the Viracta License Agreement, DOT-1 received a worldwide exclusive license under specified patent rights and know-how to develop, use, manufacture, and commercialize products containing compounds binding the RAF protein family.


DOT-1 paid $2.0 million upfront in cash to Viracta, which was recorded as research and development expenses in 2019. DOT-1 made a milestone payment of $3.0 million to Viracta in February 2021, which was recorded as research and development expense when the milestone was achieved in April 2021. DOT-1 is also required to make additional milestone payments of up to $54.0 million upon achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for each licensed product in two indications, with milestones payable for the second indication to achieve a specified milestone event being lower than milestones payable for the first indication. Additionally, if DOT-1 obtains a priority review voucher with respect to a licensed product and sells such priority review voucher to a third party or uses such priority review voucher, DOT-1 is obligated to pay Viracta a specified percentage in the mid-teen digits of all net consideration received from any such sale or of the value of such used priority review voucher, as applicable. Commencing on the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a country, DOT-1 is obligated to pay tiered royalties ranging in the mid-single-digit percentages on net sales of licensed products, if any. The obligation to pay royalties will end on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis commencing on the first commercial sale in a country and continuing until the later of: (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of the Viracta licensed patents, jointly owned collaboration patents or specified patents owned by us covering the use or sale of such product in such country, (ii) the expiration of the last statutory exclusivity pertaining to such product in such country or (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country. No other milestones, except as discussed above, were achieved and due as of December 31, 2022.
The term of the Viracta License Agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties to Viracta with respect to such product in such country. DOT-1 has the right to terminate the Viracta License Agreement with respect to any or all of the licensed products at will upon a specified notice period.
 Effective December 31, 2021, DOT-1 was merged with and into our company, with our company being the surviving corporation and assuming DOT-1’s obligations under Viracta License Agreement.
 License agreement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany
 On February 10, 2021, DOT Therapeutics-2, Inc., or DOT-2, our subsidiary, entered into a license agreement, or the MRKDG License Agreement, with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, a pharmaceutical corporation located in Darmstadt, Germany. Under the MRKDG License Agreement, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany granted to us an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers, under specified patent rights and know-how for us to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing and comprising the pimasertib and MSC2015103B compounds. We also received clinical inventory supplies to use in our research and development activities. Our exclusive license grant is subject to a non-exclusive license granted by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany’s affiliate to a cancer research organization and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany retains the right to conduct, directly or indirectly, certain ongoing clinical studies relating to pimasertib.
 Under the MRKDG License Agreement, we have obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least two licensed products in at least two specified major market countries by the year 2029.
 In consideration for the rights granted under the MRKDG License Agreement and clinical supplies, we made an upfront payment of $8.0 million, which was recorded as research and development expenses, as the technology does not have an alternative future use and supplies are used for research activities. Additionally, we made a milestone payment of $2.5 million, which was recorded as research and development expenses due to the nature of the license agreement and the milestone event relating to the first dosing of a patient in a first clinical trial of a product containing pimasertib, in the year ended December 31, 2022. We may also be required to make additional payments of up to $364.5 million based upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, as well a high, single-digit royalty percentage on future net sales of licensed products, if any. Milestones and royalties are contingent upon future events and will be recorded when the milestones are achieved and when payments are due.
The term of the MRKDG License Agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties to the licensor with respect to such licensed product in such country and will expire in its entirety upon the expiration of all of our payment obligations with respect to all licensed products and all countries under the MRKDG License Agreement.

Effective December 31, 2021, DOT-2 was merged with and into our company, with our company being the surviving corporation and assuming DOT-2’s obligations under the MRKDG License Agreement.
Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary or intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We expect that we will seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and drug candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. Presently, our patent portfolio includes issued patents and pending patent applications that are in-licensed, owned and/or co-owned by us.
 We currently, and expect that we will continue to, own, co-own or in-license patent applications and issued patents related to our drug candidates, as well as their use in the treatment of various diseases such as pediatric cancers. For our drug candidates, we generally pursue multilayered patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of use and methods of manufacture. We intend to strengthen the patent protection of our drug candidates and technologies through additional patent application filings.
 As of January 1, 2023, we owned or co-owned a patent portfolio consisting of ten patent families, exclusively in-license three patent families from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and non-exclusively in-license one patent family from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. The ten patent families that we own or co-own include patent applications and issued patents that cover compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of synthesis, synthetic intermediates, methods of treatment and combination therapies related to one of our product candidates: tovorafenib (DAY101) or pimasertib. The non-exclusively in-licensed patent family from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited covers a catalyst that may be used in a preparation of our product candidate tovorafenib (DAY101). The three exclusively in-licensed patent families from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany cover compositions of matter and methods of use for our product candidate pimasertib. Patent terms for our owned, co-owned or licensed patents discussed herein exclude any patent term extension that may be available.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. Additionally, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time a drug is under regulatory review while a patent that covers the drug is in force. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended.
 Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, if available. However, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and, if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors–Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” Expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors–Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our trademark portfolio currently contains registration applications and/or registrations for Day One, Day One Biopharmaceuticals, and Cancer Drug Development Comes of Age in the United States. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”


Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 FDA approval process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations that govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which the FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. Imposition of a clinical hold may be full or partial. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. The IRB will also monitor the clinical trial until completed. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial.


Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence.
 These Phases may overlap or be combined. For example, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial may contain both a dose- escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage, the latter of which may confirm tolerability at the recommended dose for expansion in future clinical trials (as in traditional Phase 1 clinical trials) and provide insight into the anti-tumor effects of the investigational therapy in selected subpopulation(s). Typically, during the development of oncology therapies, all subjects enrolled in Phase 1 clinical trials are disease-affected patients and, as a result, considerably more information on clinical activity may be collected during such trials than during Phase 1 clinical trials for non-oncology therapies.
 The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls.
 The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. The applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees. The FDA adjusts the user fees on an annual basis, and the fees typically increase annually.
 The FDA reviews each submitted NDA before it determines whether to file it, based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, and the FDA may request additional information. The FDA must make a decision on whether to file an NDA within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. If the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within 10 to 12 months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late- submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA does not always meet its goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.


Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also typically inspects one or more clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter, or CRL. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application, such as additional clinical data, additional pivotal clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, engage in formal dispute resolution or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has committed to reviewing resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 If, or when, the deficiencies identified in the CRL have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of an NDA supplement or, in some cases, a new NDA, before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Disclosure of clinical trial information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial, is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 Orphan drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.


The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a rare disease for which it has such designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Other benefits of orphan drug designation include tax credits for certain research and an exemption from the NDA user fee.
 Breakthrough therapy designation
 The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of applications for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical studies in an efficient manner.
 Accelerated approval
 Accelerated approval may be granted for a product that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and that generally provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments. A product eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large studies to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. The accelerated approval pathway often also requires a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence and, in most cases, the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated, and/or fully enrolled prior to approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Pediatric information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted except that PREA will apply to an original NDA for a new active ingredient that is orphan-designated if the drug is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.


The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or nonpatent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 Post-approval requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 Rare pediatric disease designation and priority review vouchers
 Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, the FDA may award a priority review voucher to the sponsor of an approved marketing application for a product that treats or prevents a rare pediatric disease. The voucher entitles the sponsor to priority review of one subsequent marketing application. A voucher may be awarded only for an approved rare pediatric disease product application. A rare pediatric disease product application is an NDA for a drug (in the case of a small molecule) that treats or prevents a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years; in general, the disease must affect fewer than 200,000 such individuals in the United States; the NDA must be deemed eligible for priority review; the NDA must not seek approval for a different adult indication (i.e., for a different disease/condition); the drug must not contain an active ingredient that has been previously approved by the FDA; and the NDA must rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population such that the approved product can be adequately labeled for the pediatric population. Before NDA approval, the FDA may designate a product in development as a product for a rare pediatric disease.
 To receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, a sponsor must notify the FDA, upon submission of the NDA, of its intent to request a voucher. If the FDA determines that the NDA is a rare pediatric disease product application, and if the NDA is approved, the FDA will award the sponsor of the NDA a voucher upon approval of the NDA. The FDA may revoke a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher if the product for which it was awarded is not marketed in the United States within 365 days of the product’s approval. The voucher, which is transferable to another sponsor, may be submitted with a subsequent NDA or biologics license application, or BLA, and entitles the holder to priority review of the accompanying NDA or BLA. The sponsor submitting the priority review voucher must notify the FDA of its intent to submit the voucher with the NDA or BLA at least 90 days prior to submission of the NDA or BLA and must pay a priority review user fee in addition to any other required user fee. The FDA must take action on an NDA or BLA under priority review within six months of receipt of the NDA or BLA.
 In December 2020, the program was reauthorized, allowing a product that is designated as a product for a rare pediatric disease prior to September 30, 2024, to be eligible to receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher upon approval of a qualifying NDA prior to September 30, 2026.


The Hatch-Waxman amendments
 Orange Book Listing
 Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments, NDA applicants are required to identify to the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s drug or approved method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, the applicant must update its listing of patents to the NDA in a timely fashion and each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book.
 Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s), strength, route of administration, and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. An approved ANDA product is considered to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved under the ANDA pathway are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug pursuant to each state’s laws on drug substitution.
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents identified for the reference listed drug in the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify to each patent in one of the following ways: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. For patents listed that claim an approved method of use, under certain circumstances the ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA holder and patentee(s) once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA (referred to as the “notice letter”). The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice letter. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months from the date the notice letter is received, expiration of the patent, the date a settlement order or consent decree is signed and entered by the court stating that the patent that is the subject of the Paragraph IV certification is invalid or not infringed, or a decision in the patent case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. In some instances, an ANDA applicant may receive approval prior to expiration of certain non-patent exclusivity if the applicant seeks, and the FDA permits, the omission of such exclusivity-protected information from the ANDA prescribing information.
 Exclusivity
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug unless the application contains a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the application may be submitted one year prior to expiration of the NCE exclusivity. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA for a generic version of the drug may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.


Certain changes to an approved drug, such as the approval of a new indication, the approval of a new strength, and the approval of a new condition of use, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity from the date of approval during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. In some instances, an ANDA applicant may receive approval prior to expiration of the three-year exclusivity if the applicant seeks, and the FDA permits, the omission of such exclusivity-protected information from the ANDA package insert.
 Patent term extension
 The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for the extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval) up to a maximum of five years. The time can be reduced for any time the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence.
 The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. However, the USPTO may decide not to grant an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than requested.
 The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years, and only one patent can be extended for any single product. The application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent, and for patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the USPTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 FDA regulation of companion diagnostics
 If use of an in vitro diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the drug product. The FDA has generally required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain a pre-market approval, or PMA, for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the drug. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of a cancer therapeutic involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Approval and clearance of a companion diagnostic also requires a high level of coordination between the drug manufacturer and device manufacturer, if different companies.
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to a substantial application fee, which is typically increased annually.
 In addition, PMAs must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic has adequate sensitivity and specificity, has adequate specimen and reagent stability, and produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.


PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also register their establishment(s), including payment of an annual establishment registration fee, and list their device(s) with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 Other healthcare laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims, transparency and health information privacy laws and other healthcare laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, amended the intent element of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act.
 Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.


Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates and their subcontractors that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and often are not preempted by HIPAA.
 Further, pursuant to the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a final rule that requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and annually report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. As of January 1, 2021, manufacturers must collect information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives for reporting in the following year. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
 We may also be subject to analogous state and foreign anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor. In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in those states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Further, certain states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain drug pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Additionally, we may also be subject to state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.


Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable state, federal, and foreign healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.
 U.S. healthcare reform
 In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of health care and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, (i) subjected therapeutic biologics to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars by creating a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products, (ii) prescribed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs and therapeutic biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, (iii) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid-managed care organizations, (iv) established annual nondeductible fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and therapeutic biologics, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, (v) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (now 70%) point of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs and therapeutic biologics to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs and therapeutic biologics to be covered under Medicare Part D, (vi) expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, (vii) expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program, (viii) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research, and (ix) established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 There have been executive, legislative and judicial efforts to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is uncertain how the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, or the healthcare measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.


Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures. U.S. federal government agencies also currently face potentially significant spending reductions, which may further impact healthcare expenditures. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. The Medicare reductions were phased back in starting with a 1% reduction in effect from April 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 before increasing to the full 2% reduction after June 30, 2022. Moreover, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If federal spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health, to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop.
 Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration of the United States announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that sought to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA also released a final rule on September 24, 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. The Biden and Trump administrations both issued executive orders intended to favor government procurement from domestic manufacturers. In addition, the Trump administration issued an executive order specifically aimed at the procurement of pharmaceutical products, which instructed the federal government to develop a list of “essential” medicines and then buy those and other medical supplies that are manufactured, including the manufacture of the API, in the United States. It is unclear whether this executive order or something similar will be implemented by the Biden administration.
 Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S Department of Health and Human Services finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. This deadline was pushed back to January 1, 2027 by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, further delayed implementation of this rule to January 1, 2032. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024.


Most recently, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA, which will, among other things, allows the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to negotiate the selling price of certain drugs and biologics that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D, although this will only apply to high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least seven years (11 years for biologics). The negotiated prices, which will first become effective in 2026, will be capped at a statutory ceiling price beginning in October 2023, penalize drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. In addition, the law eliminates the “donut hole” under Medicare Part D beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and requiring manufacturers to subsidize, through a newly established manufacturer discount program, 10% of Part D enrollees’ prescription costs for brand drugs below the out-of-pocket maximum, and 20% once the out-of-pocket maximum has been reached. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges.
At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future.
Coverage and reimbursement
 Patients in the United States and elsewhere generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Accordingly, market acceptance of our drug products is dependent on the extent to which third-party coverage and reimbursement is available from government health administration authorities (including in connection with government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States), private healthcare insurers and other healthcare funding organizations. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Coverage decisions may not favor new drug products when more established or lower-cost therapeutic alternatives are already available. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of our drug products.
 Coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement as the process of determining coverage and reimbursement is often time-consuming and costly, which will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be obtained. It is difficult to predict at this time what government authorities and third-party payors will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for our drug products. Additionally, we may develop, either by ourselves or with collaborators, companion diagnostic tests for our product candidates for certain indications. We, or our collaborators, if any, will be required to obtain coverage and reimbursement for these tests separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement we seek for our product candidates, once approved.
 The market for our product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures. In particular, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular reference listed drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a reference listed drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governmental entities have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our drugs products from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals.


In addition, we expect that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third-party payors and government authorities will continue and will place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more drug products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 We are committed to creating and maintaining a diverse, inclusive and safe work environment where our employees can bring their best selves to work each day. Our commitment to diversity extends through our recruitment, retention, learning and engagement and community partnerships. As part of our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging strategy, we made an active decision to pursue opportunities for learning and engagement that bring people from different backgrounds together into conversation.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 121 full-time employees. Of these employees, 34 held Ph.D., Pharm.D. or M.D. degrees, and 72 were engaged in research, development and technical operations. From time to time, we also retain independent contractors to support our organization. Approximately half of our employees are based at our headquarters in Brisbane, California, with others working remotely. We have never experienced a work stoppage, none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we strive to attract and retain qualified employees in order to foster long-term working relationships.
 We focus on employee development, engagement, and diversity and inclusion to identify, hire, develop, and retain the best talent. The principal purpose of our incentive share plan is to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of incentive share-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards. We provide competitive compensation and benefits that are tailored specifically to the needs and requests of our employees and are designed to help us achieve our goals of attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.
 Facilities
 Our principal executive office is located in Brisbane, California, where we lease approximately 12,000 square feet of office space. The lease expires in December 2024. There is no option to extend the lease term nor is there an option to terminate the lease prior to its expiration. We believe these facilities are sufficient to meet our ongoing needs and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
Legal Proceedings
 From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, would have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational harm, and other factors.
